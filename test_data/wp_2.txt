It said that troops then shot and killed the pair.\nIn a video released by the Israeli human rights group Bâ€™Tselem, one of the attackers appears to still be alive after the initial shooting. The video, taken by a Palestinian volunteer for the group, shows the wounded Palestinian lying on the ground, slowly moving his head at one point. About a minute later, a soldier raises his rifle, cocks the weapon and fires. Blood is then seen streaming from the Palestinianâ€™s head.\nThe incident was widely condemned by Israeli officials.\nLt. Col. Peter Lerner, a military spokesman, called the incident a â€œgrave breachâ€? of army values. Military police have detained the soldier, which Lerner called an â€œextraordinaryâ€? measure, and are investigating the incident, he said. The military said the investigation began before the video surfaced.\nA man and a boy stand by a bonfire at a makeshift camp at the Greek-Macedonian border near the village of Idomeni. Greece said deportations of migrants and refugees from Greek islands to Turkey would start April 4. (Andrej Isakovic/AFP/Getty Images)\nThe incident comes amid a six-month wave of Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks that have killed 28 Israelis and two Americans. Over the same time, at least 188 Palestinians have died by Israeli fire. Israel says most of them were attackers, and the rest died in clashes with Israeli forces.\n? Associated Press\nUKRAINE\nParliament speaker may replace Yatsenyuk\nUkraineâ€™s parliamentary speaker emerged Thursday as the front-runner to replace the unpopular Arseniy Yatsenyuk as prime minister, signaling a breakthrough in a political crisis that has lasted months.\nCurrent and former members of the ruling coalition met to discuss nominating Volodymyr Groysman, a 38-year-old former mayor and an ally of President Petro Poroshenko, but stressed that the appointment could work only if parties agree on a new coalition deal.\nSupport for Yatsenyukâ€™s Western-backed government has plunged since he took power after the 2013-2014 Maidan protests, and his government has been hanging by a thread since three parties quit the coalition.\nCoalition infighting and corruption scandals have stymied reforms demanded by Kievâ€™s Western backers and derailed negotiations for a new $1.7 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.\nGroysman might be a good compromise candidate to balance competing factional interests. But he would still need to convince the United States, the European Union and the IMF that Ukraine would honor its international commitments.\n? Reuters\n178 reported killed in yellow fever outbreak in Angola: The World Health Organization said the first yellow fever outbreak in Angola in three decades has killed 178 people. The WHO said more than 450 people have been infected since the outbreak was first reported in December. Although 5.7 million people have been vaccinated against yellow fever, there is a global vaccine shortage, the organization said. Half of severely infected patients die within 10 to 14 days if they do not get treatment. Yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes.\nPoland targets prescription-free emergency contraception: Polandâ€™s ruling conservatives plan to reinstate a prescription requirement for â€œmorning afterâ€? emergency contraceptive pills, a move that critics say reflects Catholic Church pressure. Since sweeping to power in October, the Law and Justice party has taken steps to redesign Polandâ€™s young democracy to reflect the countryâ€™s traditional Catholic values. The party has already said it will end state funding for in vitro fertilization. There is just one morning-after pill available in Poland without a prescription.\nAlgerian indicted in New Yearâ€™s Eve sex assault in Cologne: A 26-year-old Algerian man has been indicted on suspicion of participating in a sexual assault on New Yearâ€™s Eve in Cologne, the first person charged over a sexual offense in criminal incidents that heightened tensions over Germanyâ€™s migrant influx. More than 1,000 complaints were filed over a spate of New Yearâ€™s Eve crimes in Cologne, blamed largely on foreigners, and several hundred of those were allegedly sexual crimes.\nEgypt says it has killed suspects in Italian studentâ€™s death: Egyptâ€™s Interior Ministry said it has killed four members of a gang suspected of being linked to the slaying of an Italian student whose torture and death sparked an international outcry over the possible involvement of Egyptian police. The ministry said that gang members specialized in abducting foreigners while posing as policemen and that security forces found the personal belongings of 28-year-old Giulio Regeni in the gangâ€™s possession. In an exchange of gunfire, the four were killed in their vehicle in an eastern Cairo suburb, the ministry said. Regeni disappeared Jan. 25, the fifth anniversary of Egyptâ€™s 2011 uprising, when police undertook a broad security sweep.\nE.U. to start deportations from Greece on April 4: A government official in Greece said deportations of migrants\nand refugees from Greek islands to Turkey would start April 4 and would be carried out by the European Unionâ€™s border protection agency, Frontex. A spokesman for a government refugee crisis committee said the deportations ? under an international agreement on refugees ? would start with migrants who had made no asylum claim while in detention in Greece.\n?

Syrian troops and allied militiamen have taken up positions in the three neighborhoods that are part of the modern town, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group.\nIslamic State fighters have reportedly demolished some of the best-known monuments in the UNESCO World Heritage site. The extremists believe ancient ruins promote idolatry.\n? Associated Press\nVATICAN CITY\nPope sends out message of hope\nPope Francis said Saturday that darkness and fear must not prevail, as he concluded a bleak week in Europe with a message of hope during an Easter Vigil service in St. Peterâ€™s Basilica.\nIn his homily, Francis said the hope that Easter brings is a lesson for the Christian faithful to cast aside the hopelessness that can â€œimprisonâ€? people inside of themselves. â€œWe see and will continue to see problems both inside and out. They will always be there,â€? he said. But he insisted: â€œLet us not allow darkness and fear to distract us and control our hearts.â€?\nHe would later hold Easter Mass.\nHis message of hope followed his condemnations on Good Friday and earlier in the week of the attacks by Islamist extremists in Brussels and elsewhere.\n? Associated Press\nTurkish soldier killed in northern Iraq: A Turkish soldier was killed and another was wounded in northern Iraq on Saturday when rockets fired by Islamic State militants during clashes with Iraqi Kurdish fighters landed in a base where Turkish troops were deployed, Turkeyâ€™s army said. The NATO member nation, part of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, sent troops to northern Iraq in December, citing heightened security risks near Bashiqa, where its soldiers have been training an Iraqi militia to fight extremist militants. Baghdad objected to the Turkish deployment.\nMuslim shopkeeper who wished â€œhappy Easterâ€? is slain: Scottish police say the killing of a Muslim shopkeeper who wished Christians a happy Easter on social media is being investigated as â€œreligiously prejudiced.â€? Vigils were held Friday and Saturday in memory of 40-year-old Asad Shah, who was killed Thursday night in Glasgow. Police say a 32-year-old man has been arrested in connection with Shahâ€™s death. The suspect, who police say is Muslim, has not been identified or charged.\nNorth Korea threatens to attack Southâ€™s presidential palace: North Korea warned Saturday that its military is ready to attack Seoulâ€™s presidential palace unless South Korean President Park Geun-hye apologizes for â€œtreasonâ€? and publicly executes officials responsible for what Pyongyang says are plans to attack its leadership. The warning, issued by state media in the name of a unit of the Korean Peopleâ€™s Army, is the latest in its annual barrage of threats against Washington and Seoul over joint military drills now underway that the North sees as a dress rehearsal for invasion.\nVenezuelaâ€™s president is losing publicâ€™s support: Just under two-thirds of Venezuelans think NicolÃ¡s Maduroâ€™s presidency should end this year as the opposition pushes to oust him amid a grueling economic crisis, a survey by a leading pollster said. The opposition, which says Maduroâ€™s unwillingness to reform his socialist policies is pushing Venezuela towards an economic disaster, is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy to oust him.\n?

(Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\nBy Greg Jaffe and Karla Adam April 22 at 5:39 AM Follow @GregJaffe Follow @karlaadam\nLONDON ? President Obama weighed in on one of the United Kingdomâ€™s most contentious political issues Friday, urging Britain to remain part of the European Union and warning that a withdrawal would diminish British influence on the world stage.\nThe president made his case at a news conference with Prime Minister David Cameron at his side and in a surprisingly frank editorial in Londonâ€™s Daily Telegraph.\nâ€œThe European Union doesnâ€™t moderate British influence ? it magnifies it,â€? Obama wrote . â€œA strong Europe is not a threat to Britainâ€™s global leadership; it enhances Britainâ€™s global leadership.â€?\nThe editorial and the news conference with Cameron plunged Obama into the middle of an emotional debate inside Britain only two months before the countryâ€™s June 23 referendum on E.U. membership.\n[Breaking down the choices for Britain ]\nIt is highly unusual for a U.S. president to weigh in on the internal affairs of an ally so close to voters going to the polls, a fact that Obama acknowledged in his editorial. â€œI realize that thereâ€™s been considerable speculation ? and some controversy ? about the timing of my visit,â€? he wrote. But Obama argued that the â€œspecial relationshipâ€? between the United States and Britain demanded unusual honesty.\nObama sounded dire warnings about the consequences of a British exit from the European Union that to many may have sounded like threats.\nIf Britain severed ties with the E.U., Obama said, it would be at the â€œback of the queueâ€? for a trade deal with America. â€œThere might be a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement, but itâ€™s not going to happen anytime soon because our focus is in negotiating with a big block, the European Union,â€? Obama said.\nIn other moments the president tried appeals to Britonsâ€™ better angels, saying he understood the instinct at a time of worries about terrorism and massive refu?gee flows to want to â€œpull up the drawbridgeâ€? on the rest of the worldâ€™s problems.\nBut he expressed confidence that citizens in Britain and the United States would rise above those baser fears. â€œThe ties that bind Europe together are ultimately much stronger than the forces that are trying to pull them apart,â€? Obama said.\nEven before Obama arrived in Britain, Boris Johnson, Londonâ€™s mayor, accused the president of hypocrisy on the issue. Johnson, who is in favor of leaving the European Union, told the BBC that the United States â€œwouldnâ€™t dream of sharing [its] sovereignty.â€?\nObama, who came to London from Saudi Arabia, marked the beginning a three-day visit to Europe at an especially difficult moment for the continent, which faces a slow economy, refugees pouring across its borders and a growing terror threat.\nHe is expected on Monday to deliver a major speech in Germany on the problems facing Europe, its critical role in the world and its path forward.\nObama has been critical of Americaâ€™s European allies, suggesting recently in an interview with the Atlantic that Cameron and his European partners became â€œdistractedâ€? after the NATO-led intervention in Libya and didnâ€™t do enough to bring stability to the country. He has suggested that some European countries are â€œfree ridersâ€? for depending too heavily on the United States to provide for their defense.\nA cold-eyed view of allies has left Obama with few overseas friends\nDespite those criticisms, Obama remains very popular among the British people and throughout Europe. His decision to visit London so close to the referendum came at the request of Cameron, who has been a forceful and, of late, more embattled advocate for remaining in the 28-nation bloc.\nCameron spoke repeatedly of his respect for Obama and emphasized that the president was acting on his own accord to preserve American interests and strengthen the special relationship that the United States and Britain share.\nâ€œI donâ€™t have some special power over the president of the United States,â€? Cameron said. â€œTo me it is simple: stronger Britain, stronger special relationship. That is in our interests, and that is in the interest of the U.S. as well.â€?\nEven though Obama has been outspoken in his support for Britain staying in the European Union, analysts urged him to tread lightly on his visit. â€œThis is an emotionally charged discussion, and it really does not respond to calm, rational logic,â€? said Heather Conley, a senior European analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nConley said the president should â€œweigh inâ€? but avoid being part of the story. â€œDo not exacerbate the tensions surrounding the referendum,â€? she warned.\nPrior to Obamaâ€™s arrival in London, senior administration officials suggested that Obama would heed that advice.\n[ The queen wants out? A British tabloid claims she does. ]\nâ€œHis approach will be that if heâ€™s asked his view as a friend, he will offer it, but heâ€™ll make very clear that this is a matter that the British people themselves will decide,â€? Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, told reporters before the trip.\nWith his editorial in the Daily Telegraph, Obama seems to have decided that the stakes were too high for him to take a lower-profile approach.\nObama chose a Conservative-supporting newspaper, which hasnâ€™t taken a stand on the E.U. referendum, to appeal to Conservatives and others seen as crucial swing voters in the referendum.\nObama praised Britainâ€™s leadership in helping to secure a major global agreement to address climate change last year and its efforts to reach a deal with Iran to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\nSuch international efforts, with the European Union playing a leading role, are essential to peace, prosperity and international order, Obama wrote.\nâ€œToday, we face tests to this order ? terrorism and aggression; migration and economic headwinds ? challenges that can only be met if the United States and the United Kingdom can rely on one another, on our special relationship, and on the partnerships that lead to progress,â€? Obama wrote in the Telegraph.\nThe terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, in particular, have exposed big gaps in intelligence sharing among European countries. Obama argued that a unified counterterrorism partnership that spanned Europe is essential to keeping the continent safe.\nâ€œNow is a time for friends and allies to stick together,â€? he added.\nThe president had lunch Friday with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle to celebrate her 90th birthday, which Obama jokingly suggested was his real reason for his visit.\nâ€œI confess: I do want to wish Her Majesty a happy birthday in person,â€? he wrote.\nGreg Jaffe covers the White House for The Washington Post, where he has been since March 2009.\nKarla Adam is a reporter in the Washington Postâ€™s London bureau.

Over the past eight years there have certainly been? some data points ?that offer evidence of Obamaâ€™s soft power ? but there has?also been? a legitimate debate about whether it means all that much for American foreign policy.\nI bring this up because I think weâ€™re about to witness an interesting test of whether Obamaâ€™s soft power still matters in the United Kingdom. Obamaâ€™s recent and decent poll numbers in the United States ?obscure the fact that heâ€™s even more popular in the rest of the world . According to Pew, last year? 76 percent of Britons expressed confidence in Obama doing the right thing in foreign affairs.\nThis matters because the U.K. is preparing for a referendum two months from now on whether to exit the European Union, dubbed Brexit. Concerned Americans?have begun to weigh in on the issue. On the one hand, you have eight former U.S. treasury secretaries writing a letter to the London Times ?saying that Brexit would be a reeaaaaallllly bad idea. On the other hand, you have former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton being in favor of Brexit .\nThe last time something like this came up in the United Kingdom was the Scottish referendum for independence 18 months ago. Obama kept mum about that until the last minute, when? he tweeted out his opposition . That seemed to turn out well for American interests.\nThat intervention, however, was oblique compared to todayâ€™s? Daily Telegraph op-ed by the president , in which he was pretty explicit about?Brexit:\nAs citizens of the United Kingdom take stock of their relationship with the EU, you should be proud that the EU has helped spread British values and practices ? democracy, the rule of law, open markets ? across the continent and to its periphery. The European Union doesnâ€™t moderate British influence ? it magnifies it. A strong Europe is not a threat to Britainâ€™s global leadership; it enhances Britainâ€™s global leadership. The United States sees how your powerful voice in Europe ensures that Europe takes a strong stance in the world, and keeps the EU open, outward looking, and closely linked to its allies on the other side of the Atlantic. So the US and the world need your outsized influence to continue ? including within Europe.\nIt would be safe to say that this has prompted something of a reaction . Pro-Brexit leaders have respond byâ€¦ um â€¦ er â€¦ however one would like to characterize London Mayor Boris Johnsonâ€™s response to Obama . Letâ€™s just say that theyâ€™re not thrilled .\nThe Remain campaign, however, seems much happier, as Timeâ€™s Tara John reports :\nâ€œHe is a rockstar,â€? Labour Party MP Stephen Kinnock told TIME. â€œBrexiters are having a hissy fit because they know what President Obama has to say is highly influential and the British people have a natural affinity with our cousins from across the pond.â€?\nCiting a recent poll by the Guardian that found turnout by young Brits would be key in keeping the country in the E.U., Kinnock believes Obamaâ€™s popularity in the U.K. will be enough to â€œgalvanizeâ€? younger people in the June 23 referendum.\nIndeed, even before Obamaâ€™s op-ed dropped, the Financial Times opined that, â€œthe pre-emptive anger of some in the Leave campaign, accusing Mr Obama of hypocrisy and questioning his affection for the UK, only underlines how effective an intervention from him is likely to be.â€?\nThe truly?interesting question will be the effect on U.K. public opinion polls. There were already signs that, as the debate shifted to the economic realities of exiting the European Union,? the British public was shifting against the idea of Brexit . This highlights the fact that there are a lot of other forces at play here beyond Barack Obama.\nStill, if that public shift against Brexit?halts or reverses itself, one could argue that Obamaâ€™s soft power has been tapped out. If not, however, then the president still has some soft power left as he closes out the last year of his presidency.\n13\n	washingtonpost	World

Bush listens to journalists' questions after receiving a bust of Sir Winston Churchill from the British ambassador at the Oval Office on July 16, 2001. (TIM SLOAN/AFP/Getty Images)\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson -- an eccentric politician, born to wealthy parents in New York City, known for the outrageous things he says and his odd, blondish hairdo (if you can imagine such a thing) -- welcomed President Obama to his city in an unusual way: By dredging up old conspiracy theories about how Obama secretly hates Britain.\nIn an essay for the conservative paper The Sun, Johnson encouraged Obama to help make the two countries "better friends than ever." But he starts it out in a not-terribly friendly way.\nHe wrote:\nSomething mysterious happened when Barack Obama entered the Oval Office in 2009.\nSomething vanished from that room, and no one could quite explain why.\nIt was a bust of Winston Churchill ? the great British war time leader. It was a fine goggle-eyed object, done by the brilliant sculptor Jacob Epstein, and it had sat there for almost ten years.\nBut then it was returned to Britain. That's part one of Johnson's eyebrow-raising. He continued:\nSome said it was a snub to Britain. Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan Presidentâ€™s ancestral dislike of the British empire ? of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender.\nThe rest of the essay excoriates Obama for having encouraged the United kingdom?to remain a part of the European Union -- a position that Johnson opposes. (The Brits are voting on the so-called "Brexit" on June 23.)\nLet's set that aside, and instead focus on Johnson's rhetoric. His goal is clear: He wants readers to come into the essay remembering this incident from early in Obama's term so that they are more inclined to dismiss Obama's argument about the Brexit. He liberally employs the old "some people say" technique for distancing himself from the conspiracy theory about Kenya and masks the bust thing in an air of mystery.\nThere's no mystery to the bust. In January 2015, Post's fact-checker Glenn Kessler explained what happened with the bust. "[N]o one could quite explain why," Johnson writes -- except people that bothered to look.\nFrom Kessler's analysis:\nThe Winston Churchill bust in question was originally provided in July 2001 by then Prime Minister Tony Blair as a loan to President George W. Bush. The bust, now almost 70 years old, was made by English sculptor Sir Jacob Epstein, and Bush said he would keep it in the Oval Office. Various news reports at the time said the bust will be returned once Bush left office. ...\nWhen Obama took office, the Epstein bust loaned by Blair was returned to the British government, and the U.K. ambassador installed it in his residence. According to a 2010 interview with White House curator William Allman, the decision to return the bust had been made even before Obama arrived, as the loan was only scheduled to last as long as Bushâ€™s presidency.\nSo ... that's that. Kessler also notes that, at the time, conservative media in the U.K. tried to make the return of the bust into something it wasn't. This Telegraph article from February 2009 plays up the return -- and introduces the Kenyan conspiracy theory.\nWe looked at that argument separately last year. It has a life of its own among American conservatives, thanks in large part to conservative writer Dinesh D'Souza raising it in a 2010 book (and Newt Gingrich parroting that in the 2012 election).\nAs we wrote when this reemerged in February 2015:\nThe argument D'Souza makes to prove his point, by the way, is heavily circumstantial. He runs a thread from Obama's father (with whom, remember, Obama did not grow up) to anticolonial thinkers of the era in which he lived. D'Souza quotes one line from a book written by an academic, noting that this person taught Obama at Columbia. "It may seem incredible to suggest that the anticolonial ideology of Barack Obama Sr. is espoused by his son," D'Souza writes, correctly. But: "That is what I am saying." Obama "adopted his fatherâ€™s position that capitalism and free markets are code words for economic plunder" -- despite Obama's having essentially no contact with him.\nKessler tackled this, too:\nThe British media even speculated, without evidence, that Obama returned the bust because he is half-Kenyan and so he might have been upset by Churchillâ€™s decision to send troops to Kenya in 1952 to crush the Mau Mau uprising. (Historian David Anderson later told Salon this was â€œstir fry crazyâ€? because there was no Mau Mau rebellion where the Obama family lived. â€œThe Obama family come from western Kenya, which is about as different from Nairobi and the Kikuyu area as Utah is from New York City,â€? he said. â€œAnd itâ€™s almost as far away.â€?)\nSo why is Johnson dredging this back up? It's possible that he doesn't know that all of this has been debunked. It's more likely that he raises the questions for the same reason that they arose in the first place and American conservatives like D'Souza and Gingrich raised them since: To cast Obama in a negative light.\nA wealthy native New Yorker with crazy hair who disparages Barack Obama.

(Pool photo by Jack Hill via Reuters)\nPresident Obama's relationship?with the business lobby has always been contentious, but?American business and the American president seem to be in agreement about European politics.\nObama is London Friday at the invitation of British?Prime Minister David Cameron. The two men are hoping to persuade the British people?that the United Kingdom should remain?in the European Union, a question that voters will decide in a national referendum in June.\nAhead of Obama's visit,?a group that represents major transatlantic corporations?released a survey showing that its members?are worried?about the chances that?voters will want out.\nEconomists say that one of the major benefits of membership in the European Union is?that?manufacturers in the United Kingdom can export their products to countries on the European continent without paying tariffs or dealing with regulatory discrepancies in the rules governing their products.\nThe research firm Oxford Economics has forecast that exiting the E.U. could reduce the size of the U.K. economy by between 0.1 percent and 3.9 percent by 2030.\n[ Everything you need to know about Britain leaving the European Union ]\nThose potential losses are a?concern for U.S. firms that do business in the United Kingdom. Seven in 10?firms?in the straw poll?by BritishAmerican Business -- which surveyed companies that do business in both countries?-- said?the effect of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union on their businesses would be negative or strongly negative, according to a press release.\nMark Dorsett,?the U.K. director of Caterpillar,?called the issue "fundamental to our business interests," according to the survey.\n"We fully respect that the British people will decide the U.K.'s future relationship with the E.U., but we believe the U.K.'s continued membership of a reformed competitive E.U. is the best option," he said.?Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., employs 9,000 people in the United Kingdom.\nThose arguing?for?the country's exit from the European Union say?that?regulations imposed from?Brussels are hampering?U.K. firms.\nYet if there is one thing that?the business lobby seems to like less than regulation, it's uncertainty -- and a vote to leave the European Union would raise lots of questions for firms that do business there?by?forcing British officials to renegotiate the rules that govern trade with the rest of Europe.\nOutside of the survey by BritishAmerican Business, other U.S.?corporate leaders have been making this point.\n"If the outcome of the referendum is to exit, what you have for sure is going to be two years or three years of intense negotiation and a massive uncertainty," Daniel Pinto, the head of the corporate and investment bank at?JPMorgan Chase, told investors in February. "It may be good or bad in the long term.

Clary/AFP/Getty Images)\nOne of Americaâ€™s top hopes for an Olympic medal in tennis has decided not to compete in this summerâ€™s Olympic Games in Rio.\nJohn Isner, the highest-ranked American at No. 16 in the world, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Monday that he has opted?to skip the Olympics this year in favor of focusing on the American hard-court season.\nâ€œItâ€™s a decision I didnâ€™t take lightly,â€? Isner said?via AJC .\nWith Isner out, that leaves world No. 26 Jack Sock as the next highest-ranked American eligible. As many as four Americans will receive invitations to play in Rio.\nIsner, 30, has traditionally performed well during the U.S. hard-court swing. He plans on playing at the Citi Open tournament in Washington that runs from July 16-24, followed by The BB&T Atlanta Open played Aug. 1-7, the week before tennis begins in Rio.\nâ€œLogistically, it would be pretty much impossible for me to do both,â€?? Isner said via AJC of playing in Atlanta and?Rio .\nIsner is also expected to play the week before Atlanta at the Rogers Cup in Toronto, one of the premier summer hard-court tournaments that is a mandatory event on the ATP World Tour calendar.\nAt his first Olympic Games at London in 2012, Isner lost in the quarterfinals to eventual silver medalist Roger Federer. And while many athletes train to peak at the Olympics, professional tennis revolves around the Grand Slams, Isner said.\nâ€œNothing against the Olympics,â€? Isner told The Post in late February when he announced his commitment to the Citi Open . â€œI played in 2012 and it was an incredible experience. Itâ€™s different for tennis players than for swimmers and track and field athletes. Thatâ€™s the pinnacle of their sport and not so much the pinnacle of tennis.â€?\nThe U.S. Open, the last Grand Slam of the season, will be played Aug. 29-Sept. 11 in Flushing Meadows, N.Y. Isner has not advanced past the fourth round at the U.S. Open?since 2011.\nâ€œTennis is not really a traditional Olympic sport,â€? Isner said in our interview.?â€œIf you ask Roger [Federer], I donâ€™t think he dreamed of winning Olympic gold. He probably dreamed of winning Wimbledon seven times, like he has. â€¦Our biggest events are the Grand Slams and are always going to be the Grand Slams.â€?\nsports\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	World

(Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty Images)\nSupporters of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, whom the Chamber of Deputies voted to impeach Sunday night, have been calling the proceedings a â€œ coup .â€? HÃ©ctor Perla suggested here on Saturday that they constitute a â€œ soft coup .â€??Is Sundayâ€™s vote actually a coup?\nThe short answer: No.\n[ Hereâ€™s why some people think Brazil is in the middle of a â€˜soft coupâ€™ ]\nLetâ€™s discuss what a coup (also known as a coup dâ€™Ã©tat) is. There are many definitions of coups out there. All have a few elements. (1) Coups seize executive power. (2) They are led by a small group of military officers or occasionally other social elites. (3) They use unconstitutional or â€œextralegalâ€? means outside the bounds of the existing political system.\nFollowing a constitutional procedure is better than a military overthrow\nSo if we think of 367 lawmakers as a â€œsmall group,â€? what happened Sunday might fit the first and second components of the definition. It definitely doesnâ€™t fit the third component:?the use of unconstitutional or â€œextralegalâ€? means. The impeachment case against Dilma Rousseff has proceeded through constitutional channels, following the letter if not the spirit of the law. This is why experts can explain the series of procedures that will follow over the next several months.\nEmphasizing constitutional procedure is not technical quibbling. It matters a lot for understanding Brazil today. Not so long ago, Latin American military and civilian elites alike felt confident entirely sidestepping the constitution if they strongly opposed current officeholders. Fifty or 60 years ago, a military and political coalition might have unceremoniously shown a president like Rousseff ? one overseeing a severe recession and at loggerheads with parliament ? the exit.\nToday, threat of military intervention is low, and politicians canâ€™t simply muscle Rousseff out. They have to follow complicated, legalistic procedures with uncertain outcomes.\nYes, Rousseffâ€™s opponents ? including dominant media outlets ? are trying to manipulate public opinion. This is a political weapon of the democratic era. Yes, Federal Judge Sergio Moro improperly released bugged recordings of a conversation between Rousseff and former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva in his investigation of the Operation Car Wash scandal. Impeachment itself is still constitutional.\nIn the 1990s, the influential political scientists Juan Linz and Alfred Stepan explained that democracy becomes â€œ the only game in town â€? when â€œeven in the face of severe political and economic crises, the overwhelming majority of the people believe that â€¦ political change must emerge from within the parameters of democratic procedures,â€? and when everyone becomes â€œhabituatedâ€? to political conflict being â€œresolved according to established norms.â€?\nThe fact that Rousseffâ€™s supporters and opponents are both following the same rules is no small victory for the rule of law in Brazil.\nBut neither is it exactly democratic; itâ€™s a misuse of democratic procedure\nThe actual improprieties named in the impeachment charges ? balancing the federal budget by reducing and delaying transfers of funds to a government-owned development bank ? are relatively minor. Under most conditions, they wouldnâ€™t lead to?impeachment. As legislators spoke one by one on Sunday night, though, they largely ignored the actual charges.\nPerhaps the lowest point of the evening came when one legislator dedicated his pro-impeachment vote to the general who tortured Rousseff during Brazilâ€™s 1964-1985 military dictatorship.\nImpeachment is not a popularity contest. In 1993, Brazil held an unusual constitutional referendum to decide whether to switch from a presidential to a parliamentary system of government. If the referendum had passed, Rousseff would have been a prime minister, and Brazilâ€™s parliament would have used a vote of no confidence to fire her Sunday. But the referendum didnâ€™t pass, and Brazilâ€™s president can be dismissed only for a limited number of offenses . Juan Linz famously argued that presidentialism can lead to democratic breakdown because presidents and parliaments donâ€™t have a way to fire each other when cooperation fails. By misusing the impeachment process, Brazilâ€™s parliament has solved this problem.\n[ Itâ€™s not just Trump. Authoritarian populism is rising across the West. Hereâ€™s why. ]\nAnÃbal PÃ©rez-Li?Ã¡n shows that politics often affect the way Latin American legislatures handle impeachment charges . Sometimes legislatures fail to impeach the guilty, and other times they gang up on an executive against whom there is little proof. What happened Sunday is analogous to jurors ruling against a defendant based not on the charges, but because they think she is a bad person. This does not constitute a coup, but it is a misuse of democratic procedures.\nSo if the actual charges are minor, why do legislators want to impeach Rousseff?\nThe first reason for Rousseffâ€™s extreme unpopularity is the countryâ€™s major recession . Arguably more important, though, is the ongoing and enormous Operation Car Wash corruption scandal. Even though there is no evidence Rousseff was directly involved, many people believe she must have known what was going on. Her predecessor and mentor Lula is being investigated. Rousseff attracted wrath when she attempted to offer Lula a cabinet post , a move that would have protected him from some forms of prosecution. Many elected officials implicated in the scandal appear to be pursuing her to deflect attention from themselves.\nAll of this ? combined with Rousseffâ€™s?poor political skills ? has led the PTâ€™s coalition of relatively small and unruly parties to fall apart. This makes her highly politically vulnerable.\nWill impeaching Rousseff?actually help legislators avoid scrutiny?\nLatin American history provides little guide. Brazilâ€™s President Fernando Collor de Mello was impeached in 1992 in a relatively contained corruption scandal . Venezuela lawmakers in 1993 and Ecuadoran lawmakers in 1997 unsuccessfully attempted to contain widespread crises by impeaching presidents.\nStill, the strategy may work this time, given the number of lawmakers implicated in Operation Car Wash. Surely it is not actually possible to throw all?the bums out. By focusing popular ire on the executive first, at least some corrupt legislators will likely be able to outlast the current crisis.\nAmy Erica Smith is assistant professor of political science at Iowa State University and is working on a book project titled â€œThe Culture Wars in Another America: Evangelicals, Catholics, and Brazilian Democracy.â€?\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	World

(Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images (Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images)\nBy Robert Barnes April 20 at 11:07 AM Follow @scotusreporter\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday cleared the way for American victims of terrorism to collect nearly $2 billion in seized Iranian assets, but not without a warning from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. that the court was undermining its authority.\nThe justices ruled 6 to 2 that Congress had not violated the separation of powers when it passed a bill making it easier for about 1,300 people to collect money on behalf of those killed or injured in the 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut and other attacks blamed on Iran.\n[ Roberts worried statute that helps terrorism victims violates separation of powers ]\nThe ruling upheld a 2014 appeals court decision awarding the money to the families.\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the majority, said Congress had the power to pass such a law even if its intention was to influence the resolution of decades-long litigation in which the families sought compensation from Iran.\nâ€œCongress, our decisions make clear, may amend the law and make the change applicable to pending cases, even when the amendment is outcome determinative,â€? Ginsburg wrote, adding that presented â€œno threat to the independence of the judiciary.â€?\nThose who favor the ability of victims of state-sponsored terrorism to use the court for redress said the decision was an important one.\nUniversity of Notre Dame law professor Jimmy GurulÃ©, a former prosecutor who filed an amicus brief on behalf of the families, said the decision â€œsends a powerful message to rogue states and state sponsors of terrorism that if you, directly or indirectly, provide material support for terrorism, you will be held accountable.â€?\nThe ruling capped a legal battle that began in 2003 when a coalition of families sued the government of Iran. Among the plaintiffs was Deborah Peterson of Fairfax, Va., who was seeking to avenge the killing of her brother, 20-year-old Marine Cpl. James Knipple. Knipple was at the barracks on the day of the attack as part of an American peacekeeping mission.\nOn Wednesday ? after spending more than 30 years dedicating efforts to her brotherâ€™s memory, and about half that time fighting this battle in the courts ? Peterson said she hadnâ€™t quite internalized the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision.\nâ€œI donâ€™t think you ever really have closure,â€? Peterson said. â€œIâ€™ll always be sad that Jim didnâ€™t have a whole life, a full life.â€?\nStill, there is some solace to be found, she said, that â€œin the eyes of the law, we know who is responsible, and those who are responsible have been brought to the justice that we are capable of bringing them to here on earth.â€?\nMatthew D. McGill, one of the lawyers who represented the families at the Supreme Court, said the decision â€œremoves the last remaining legal impediment to the distribution of these funds to the victims of Iranâ€™s acts of terrorism.\nâ€œWe will promptly ask the district court supervising the funds to carry out the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision and authorize distribution of the funds to the victims, some of whom have waited almost 33 years for justice.â€?\n[ Not all victims represented in Supreme Court Iran terrorism caseâ€™ ]\nCitizens are generally barred from suing foreign governments in U.S. courts, but there is an exception for terrorist acts. Family members of the deceased and those injured went to court and showed, for instance, that the October 1983 bombing that killed 241 sleeping service members in a Beirut barracks was conducted by the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran.\nIran never responded to the suit.\nSurvivors of 173 of those killed in the Beirut attack and other acts of terrorism secured judgments against Iran, and courts ruled they were entitled to more than $10 billion in compensation. After President Obama froze Iranian assets in the United States in 2012, the plaintiffs targeted nearly $2 billion in Iranian-owned bonds held in a New York bank.\nMeanwhile, the families lobbied Congress to pass a law saying, essentially, that the victims were entitled to the funds. Bank Markazi, Iranâ€™s central bank, challenged the law, as well as a 2014 ruling by the New York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit that the money should be awarded to the victims.\nBank Markazi said legislation that directs the winner of a lawsuit violates the separation of powers and usurps judicial authority.\nBut Ginsburg, joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Elena Kagan, disagreed.\nâ€œA statute does not impinge on judicial power when it directs courts to apply a new legal standard to undisputed facts,â€? Ginsburg wrote, saying Congress has passed such specific legislation in the past.\nShe said the subject matter was important, as well. The law â€œis an exercise of congressional authority regarding foreign affairs, a domain in which the controlling role of the political branches is both necessary and proper,â€? Ginsburg wrote.\nâ€œCongress acted comfortably withinâ€? its authority over foreign sovereign immunity and foreign-state assets, she wrote.\nRoberts strenuously objected, however, and was joined in his dissent by liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\nâ€œArticle III of the Constitution commits the power to decide cases to the judiciary alone,â€? Roberts wrote. â€œYet in this case, Congress arrogated that power to itself.â€?\nAt issue, the chief justice said, â€œis a basic principle, not a technical rule.â€? An act of Congress had decided the case â€œno less certainly than if Congress had directed entry of judgment for respondents,â€? he wrote.\nâ€œHereafter, with this courtâ€™s approval, Congress can unabashedly pick the winners and losers in particular pending cases. Todayâ€™s decision will indeed become a blueprint for extensive expansion of the legislative power at the judiciaryâ€™s expense,â€? Roberts wrote.\nThe case is Bank Markazi v.

By no means is the country on the verge of collapse, but here are some reasons why the turmoil isn't so good for the rest of us. (Nick Miroff,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\nIf you caught a glimpse of last weekendâ€™s impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff, you may have noticed that Brazil is going bonkers right now. There was spitting , shoving and confetti-shooting on the floor of parliament, which at times looked more like a Roman coliseum than a legislative chamber.\nRousseff lost the vote badly, setting up what is likely to be a protracted, bitter political battle to unseat her. She will be forced to step down temporarily if Brazilâ€™s senate votes as soon as mid-May to go?forward with the impeachment process, with?hearings?that could drag on for six months.\n[ How Brazil, the darling of the developing world, came undone ]\nThe country of 200 million people, by far the largest in Latin America, is increasingly polarized and entirely consumed with its political crisis. By no means is Brazil on the verge of collapse, but here are some reasons why the turmoil isnâ€™t so good for the rest of us.\n1. The Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro are a little over three months away.\nOrganizers of the Games insist that the events will float above the impeachment fray, but when a countryâ€™s entire political class is engaged in a bruising competition of its own, itâ€™s hard to see how the Olympics wonâ€™t suffer. The Games were meant to showcase Brazilâ€™s rise as a global power, but the countryâ€™s moment in the spotlight will come at its lowest point in decades. Itâ€™s like trying to host a huge party with your spouse when youâ€™re in the middle of a nasty?divorce.\nU.S. officials are expecting more than 100,000 Americans to travel to Brazil for the games, including athletes, their families and sponsors. Thereâ€™s room for plenty more visitors, since nearly half?of the tickets have yet to be sold for many events. Brazilians are generally in a foul mood, and a lot of them may not feel like pretending everythingâ€™s fine just for the sake of the Games.\nOne bit of good news: Most of the Olympic venues have been completed ahead of schedule and are ready to go.\nThe bad: There are a few other reasons Brazil is a mess right now.\nSupporters sing the Brazil's national anthem during a protest against the impeachment of Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff, on Copacabana beach, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Sunday, April 17, 2016. (Silvia Izquierdo/AP)\n2. The Zika virus is still spreading.\nAlthough Zika has peaked in some places, like Colombia, global health officials say the outbreak is still expanding in Brazil, with many new infections?in big cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Brazilian researchers are investigating thousands of cases of children with undersized heads and birth defects that may have been caused by the virus. With Brazilâ€™s politicians locked in a power struggle, the country may be losing a shot at a well-organized public health response with robust support across the political spectrum.\n[ How Brazilâ€™s impeachment process works ]\nFor all the global attention on Brazilâ€™s Zika outbreak, thereâ€™s surprisingly little discussion of the epidemic in the country itself. Instead, everyoneâ€™s obsessed with?politics.\n3. Brazilâ€™s economy is the seventh- or eighth-largest in the world, so its financial woes are a drag on global trade.\nThe countryâ€™s economy was growing at 7.5 percent a year as recently as 2010; this year, itâ€™s headed for a 3.8 contraction for the second time?in a row. Millions who climbed out of poverty during Brazil's boom years?are falling back down, and a country that could be a much bigger market for U.S. exports is â€œunderperforming,â€? according to Brazil expert and former diplomat Marcos Troyjo at Columbia University.\nâ€œOf the 20 largest economies in the world, Brazil is the most insular,â€? explained?Troyjo, director of the BRICLab that studies emerging economies. In some of the fastest-growing countries?in the world, such as Chile and Korea, the sum of their imports and exports amounts to more than 50 percent of the countryâ€™s overall economic output, Troyjo explained. In Brazil, itâ€™s only 25 percent because so many industries are shielded from foreign competition. â€œThat makes domestic consumption more expensive,â€? he said.\nEven one of the Brazilian economyâ€™s few bright spots ? surging soybean exports ? is a two-edge sword, since the countryâ€™s agribusiness sector is a driving force behind the type of Amazonian deforestation that is harder to control during moments of government weakness and economic woe.\n4. Brazilian stability is critical for democratic governance in Latin America.\nThe country has a free press and independent institutions, and its judiciary is engaged in a major crackdown on corruption that has played a big role in unsettling Brazilâ€™s old political order.\nâ€œItâ€™s a vibrant democracy with an independent, feisty media, no relevant ethnic or religious strife and a population that generally shares the values of most Americans,â€? said Brian Winter, a Brazil expert and the vice president of the Americas Society and Council of the Americas in New York.\nâ€œWe should want all the world to look like Brazil, at least in those respects,â€? he said.\nEven though the United States is more populous, turnout in Brazil is so high that more people vote in democratic elections there than in any country in the Americas, according to Troyjo.\nBut many in the region also express disappointment that Brazil has at times been a muted voice for democracy and human rights, especially with a humanitarian crisis looming in Venezuela. The Rousseff government is too weak and too embattled to wield much influence, and its reluctance to criticize its neighbors?may reinforce a?reputation for?geopolitical caution and insularity, critics say.\n5.?Close relations with Brazil matter to?the?U.S. strategic goal of countering China's influence in the Americas. ?\nIn a world dominated by two superpowers ? the United States and China ? experts say Beijing has been winning the contest for influence in Brazil lately. China has become?Brazilâ€™s largest trading partner , as?it buys so much of the countryâ€™s iron ore, farm products and other raw exports.\nThe?United States has a larger and longer history of investment in Brazilian factories and industry, but those are the sectors of the economy hurting the most right now.\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

Salah Abdeslam, a key suspect in the terrorist attacks in Paris in November, was handed over to French authorities Wednesday to stand trial in the coming months in a case that could shed further light on Islamist militant recruitment and networks in Europe.\nAfter appearing before investigative judges Wednesday afternoon, Abdeslam faces charges of terrorist murder and possession and use of weapons and bombs, according to Frank Berton, his French attorney. Jean-Jacques Urvoas, the French justice minister, announced that Abdeslam would be held in solitary confinement in a maximum-security prison near Paris.\n[ Paris terrorist suspect is â€˜a little jerk,â€™ his lawyer says ]\nAlthough complete details of his role in the November attacks remain unclear, Abdeslam is suspected to have been among the logistical planners, organizing the hotel rooms and rental cars that facilitated the bloodiest massacre on French soil since World War II.\nAbdeslam, a 26-year-old Belgian citizen of Moroccan descent, was arrested in the Brussels district of Molenbeek on March 18 after having eluded authorities in Belgium and France since the Nov.?13 attacks, which killed 130 people. He was apprehended just a short distance from his childhood home, four months after the attacks.\nHis capture came just four days before the March 22 bombings at Brusselsâ€™s international airport and one of the cityâ€™s metro stations that left 32 people dead and hundreds injured.\nSince his arrest, Abdeslam had been detained in a prison in northern Belgium. His transfer to France follows a European arrest warrant that was issued immediately after his capture.\nAbdeslamâ€™s arrest was a watershed moment in the ongoing investigation into a cell of largely European-born jihadists who are thought to have orchestrated the Paris and Brussels attacks. Authorities believe these militants were inspired by the Islamic State and used their European citizenship to ease their way across borders and other potential checks.\nBut Abdeslam's capture was also a plot point in the evolving terrorist activities of the Brussels-based cell. The group had initially planned a second attack in France, officials believe, but opted to strike in Brussels as counterterrorism units closed in.\nIn recent weeks, links between the Paris and Brussels attacks have become increasingly clear, with significant crossover between the suspects in each attack.\nNajim Laachraoui, 24, identified as one of the two suicide bombers at Brussels Airport, is also suspected of having made the bombs used in the Paris attacks.\nSimilarly, Mohamed Abrini, 31, the â€œman in the hatâ€? depicted in surveillance footage at the airport minutes before the attacks, had also been caught on camera driving Abdeslam across the French-Belgian border in the days before the November Paris attacks.\nBelgian authorities arrested Abrini earlier this month.\nThe extent to which the cell of terrorists remains active remains unclear, although much of Europe remains on highest alert.\nLast week, French officials proposed extending the national state of emergency enacted after the November attacks through the summer, which would cover the Euro 2016 soccer tournament as well as the Tour de France bicycle race.\nAbdeslamâ€™s forthcoming trial could provide an opportunity for authorities to learn more about plans that still may be in the works.\nâ€œHe probably knows a lot about who might carry out other attacks in Europe,â€? said Jean-Charles Brisard, the head of the French Center for the Analysis of Terrorism. â€œWhat he might say could really be crucial to foil other plots in Europe in the coming weeks or months.â€?\nDaniela Deane in London contributed to this report.\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

The jury also found that the fans did not contribute to the disaster.\nPolice in South Yorkshire have long maintained that misbehaving fans caused the disaster, and the first inquest, in 1991, returned a verdict of â€œaccidental death,â€? which was decried by the bereaved families. That verdict was overturned in 2012 after new evidence came to light, and a new inquest was begun after a determined campaign by the families.\n[ Liverpool holds final service for 96 fans lost in 1989 Hillsborough disaster ]\nAccording to the Guardian , the Independent Police Complaints Commission is conducting two separate investigations into possible criminal offenses committed by the police during the disaster, along with possible perjury charges against the officers who blamed the fans during the inquests. Investigators said they will send their findings to the Crown Prosecution Service by the end of the year.\nThe Hillsborough incident was one of the worst disasters in sports history, with 96 killed and 766 injured on April 15, 1989, after Liverpoolâ€™s fans were allowed to cram into already-full standing-room terraces during the FA Cup semifinal at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, chosen for the game as a neutral site. Five minutes after the game began, a fence separating the fans from the field gave way under pressure of the surging spectators, causing fans to fall upon one another. According to the BBC , more than 3,000 people tried to cram into terraces that were designed to hold only half that number.\nThe authoritiesâ€™ response to the incident was marred by errors. Ambulances were dispatched to the stadium but few medical personnel made it to the field because police were keeping them away or focusing on keeping the Liverpool fans away from the Nottingham supporters. Most of the people who died ? 82 of 96, according to the BBC ? never even made it to the hospital, suffocating on the field or in the terraces.\nSeventy eight of the victims were aged 30 or younger. Thirty eight were children or teenagers. The youngest was 10 years old.\nFinally, thankfully, justice for the 96! Rest in peace. pic.twitter.com/LEutDYfol5\n? Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) April 26, 2016\nFamilies of the deceased cheered the verdict, gathering outside the courtroom to chant â€œjustice for the 96â€³ and sing â€œYouâ€™ll Never Walk Alone,â€? the Rodgers and Hammerstein song that has been adopted by Liverpool fans as an anthem.\nHillsborough families emerge from the Unlawful Killing verdict and outside court sing You'll Never Walk Alone. pic.twitter.com/pGLvhb4xuU\n?

For weeks the regime of Bashar al-Assad has been proclaiming its intention to recapture the rebel-held eastern side of Aleppo, with help from â€œ our Russian partners ,â€? as the prime minister put it. The bombing of hospitals and food markets, in turn, is a standard component of Mr. Assadâ€™s military campaigns, intended to drive civilians out of rebel-held areas.\nBy Saturday, the Aleppo offensive was in its ninth day ; according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 226 civilians had been killed by bombing and shelling through Friday, including 50 women and children. Yet U.S. and U.N. officials were still clinging to the fiction that the â€œ cessation of hostilities â€? they said began on Feb. 27, and which the Assad regime never fully observed, was still somehow alive. â€œI think we would still maintain that it had largely held,â€? State Department spokesman John Kirby said Thursday, as rescuers pulled children from the ruins of the hospitalâ€™s pediatric ward.\nU.S. policy in Syria has devolved into a sickening routine. Secretary of State John F. Kerry negotiates with Russia on steps to end the violence, while insisting that the United States will turn to a â€œPlan?Bâ€? if they fail. Russia and the Syrian regime then make a mockery of the agreements, continuing to bomb civilians and attack Western-backed rebels. Mr. Kerry duly denounces the atrocities, as he did on Thursday, when he pronounced himself â€œoutragedâ€? by the â€œdeliberate strike on a known medical facility.â€?\nThen, forgetting his previous talk of a Plan B, Mr.?Kerry returns to the Russians with another appeal for cooperation. Thatâ€™s what happened after the hospital bombing: The State Department recommitted to the â€œpolitical process,â€? according to Mr. Kirby, who went so far as to describe Plan B as â€œmythical.â€? On Friday, a new, partial cease-fire was announced , beginning Saturday in the Damascus suburbs and the coastal area of Latakia. Aleppo, where the regimeâ€™s offensive is taking place, was excluded.\nIn fact, there does appear to be a U.S. Plan B, according to the Wall Street Journal, which recently reported that it involved supplying more powerful weapons to the Syrian rebels, possibly including missiles that could shoot down Syrian planes and helicopters. It has been widely reported that Mr.?Kerry himself has lobbied for more aid to the rebels as a way of gaining leverage over the Assad regime and Russia. And yet action has been held up, as throughout the Syrian civil war, by President?Obama, who, fearing U.S. intervention will make the situation worse, rejects any steps that could make it better.\nThe latest atrocities should prompt Mr. Obama to reconsider. Measures to strengthen the rebels, and ground the governmentâ€™s air force, are not only the morally right response to the deliberate bombing of hospitals and food stores. Pragmatically, they offer the only way to force the Assad regime and its allies to negotiate seriously about Syriaâ€™s future. The president still has the chance to mitigate his past mistakes and create a path toward peace in Syria. He should seize it.\nopinions\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	World

A senior U.S. State Department official said the â€œrecommitmentâ€? to a truce would also cover East Ghouta, on the outskirts of Damascus.\nâ€œFor the moment, this is what we have to go forward with, but we are working constantly on Aleppo and other areas,â€? said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under guidelines imposed by the State Department.\nThe agreement ? which Russia initially said would last 72 hours but the State Department said was open-ended ? came as another wave of airstrikes and shelling swept across Aleppo, where more than 200 people have been killed in the past week. While Syrian government airstrikes were blamed for bombarding a hospital Wednesday, killing at least 50, rebel barrages apparently also contributed to the violence.\nRussia reported that its consulate in Aleppo had also been hit by mortars it said were launched by Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate, some of whose forces are interspersed in the area with opposition fighters supported by the United States and its regional allies.\nRenewed fighting has brought to a virtual collapse the partial cease-fire forged earlier this year by Washington and Moscow, supported by a group of nations with interests in Syria.\nIn the first month after its Feb. 27 implementation, the cease-fire brought a welcome quiet after years of civil war, with Russia greatly reducing its airstrikes against opposition forces in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, although the Syrian government was accused of frequent violations.\nMost opposition groups stopped offensive actions, despite coming under government attack. Only two groups ? the Islamic State and Nusra, both deemed terrorist organizations by the United Nations ? were excluded from what the agreement called a â€œcessation of hostilities.â€?\nBut in recent weeks, as renewed fighting escalated ? particularly in Latakia, the outskirts of Damascus and Aleppo ? Russia and the United States have publicly accused each other of undermining the truce, although they insist that they are continuing to cooperate to monitor its implementation.\nIt has been particularly intense this week in and around Aleppo, a city divided between opposition and government forces since 2012, as Syrian government forces apparently have tried to cut off rebel supply lines from Turkey. Russian and Syrian forces have moved both troops and heavy artillery to the area after a recent successful offensive in the desert city of Palmyra, saying that Nusra forces are massing to take over the city.\nU.S. intelligence and outside experts tracking combatant movements acknowledge that Nusra and rebel forces are intertwined in areas in and around Aleppo, but they discount Russian claims that the militants are either â€œmassingâ€? or planning a new offensive. Instead, they say, Syria and Russia are seeking to attack opposition rebels under the guise of striking Nusra, as allowed under the cease-fire.\nA U.S.-Russia task force that is supposed to monitor the cease-fire and adjudicate violation claims met behind closed doors in Geneva on Thursday to revitalize the truce in selected areas. Although the United States and its allies in the region have said that Assad has been responsible for most violations overall, the task forceâ€™s failure to publicly rule on any breaches has undermined opposition confidence in its efforts.\nThe cease-fire was designed from the start both for its own sake and to provide a helpful environment for political talks, overseen in Geneva by the United Nations, between opposition and Assad representatives on a transition government. Although U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura said that progress had been made in two rounds of talks, opposition representatives formally suspended their participation last week because of the rising violence on the ground.\nOn Wednesday, de Mistura said he hoped to restart them in May but that there was little point in setting a date until the violence decreased. He appealed for â€œa U.S.-Russia urgent initiative at the highest levelsâ€? and a new meeting of the International Syrian Support Group, the group of foreign ministers of European and Middle Eastern governments co-chaired by Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, that negotiated the original cease-fire in February.\nThe State Department official said that Kerry and Lavrov had spoken by telephone Friday and that â€œwe need to bring the ministers of the ISSG back together.â€?\nKaren DeYoung is associate editor and senior national security correspondent for the Washington Post.\nworld\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	World

More than 250 people have died in shelling and airstrikes there in the past nine days, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\nThe government declared a cease-fire around Damascus and the coastal region of Latakia on Friday after two weeks of escalating clashes. But more than three dozen rebel factions said Saturday that they would not respect the truce unless the government agreed to extend it over the whole country.\nThe Observatory said that 859 civilians, including 143 children, died last month, despite a partial cease-fire brokered by the United States and Russia in late February. That cease-fire disintegrated in recent weeks, largely because of the fighting in and around Aleppo.\nLt. Gen. Sergei Kuralenko told Russian news agencies at a Russian air force base in Syria that Moscowâ€™s forces ? which are in Syria to help shore up the government of President Bashar al-Assad, a longtime Kremlin ally ? were negotiating a cease-fire for Aleppo province.\n? Associated Press\nEGYPT\nPolice block workersâ€™ labor day assembly\nEgyptian police prevented hundreds of workers from holding a meeting in Cairo to commemorate International Workersâ€™ Day on Sunday, while independent trade union leaders urged the government to allow them freedom of assembly.\nKamal Abbas of the Center for Trade Unions and Workersâ€™ Services said about 650 workers came to the city center and initially sought an alternative location to hold a news conference after police prevented them from entering the journalists syndicate building.\nThe area was under lockdown by dozens of uniformed and plainclothes security forces, some wearing masks and carrying automatic weapons.\nThe journalists syndicate has been a rallying point for demonstrations in the past and was similarly blocked ahead of planned anti-government protests last week.\nWorker movements were among the early supporters of the 2011 revolt that ousted longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak, ushering in years of tumult as the country was ruled successively by the military, elected but divisive Islamist Mohamed Morsi, and now President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi.\nSpokesmen for the Interior Ministry, which is in charge of Egyptâ€™s police, and the presidentâ€™s office did not respond to calls seeking comment. Sunday coincides with Egyptâ€™s Orthodox Easter, as well as a long holiday weekend celebrating the beginning of spring.\n? Associated Press\nU.S. missionaries found slain\nin Jamaica: Police in Jamaica say two U.S. missionaries were found killed in a rural area of the Caribbean island that has long struggled with high rates of violent crime. In a statement Sunday, the Jamaica Constabulary Force identified the men as Randy Hentzel, 48, and Harold Nichols, 53. Their battered bodies were found in bushes in separate areas of St.?Mary parish. No arrests have been made. Investigators have not issued a possible motive, and police did not provide home towns for the victims. Hentzelâ€™s Facebook page says he was from Donnellson, Iowa. Nicholsâ€™s home town was unclear.\n3 detained in Bangladesh in death of Hindu man: Police in Bangladesh detained three men, including the head of an Islamic school, in the stabbing death of a Hindu tailor in an attack for which the Islamic State asserted responsibility. Police said the school principal had sued Nikhil Joarder, the tailor, four years ago for allegedly making derogatory comments about the prophet Muhammad. Joarder was killed Saturday in his shop by two men. The killing was similar to recent attacks in Bangladesh on atheist bloggers, academics, religious minorities and others by Muslim extremists.\nMilitants free 10 Indonesian hostages in Philippines: Abu Sayyaf militants in the Philippines have freed 10 Indonesian crew members seized at sea in March in the first of three attacks on tugboats that have sparked a regional maritime security alarm, officials said. A Philippine army officer who has been helping to deal with kidnappings by Abu Sayyaf said a rebel commander from the Moro National Liberation Front, which has signed a peace deal with the Philippine government, helped negotiate with Abu Sayyaf for the release of the 10 Indonesians.\nVenezuela raises minimum wage 30?percent: Venezuelaâ€™s president ordered a 30?percent increase in the minimum wage, the latest move by the socialist government to grapple with high inflation and economic stagnation. The boost announced by President NicolÃ¡s Maduro comes after a 25?percent increase on March?1. The new increase will push the minimum wage to 15,051 bolivars a month. That is about $1,500 at the official exchange rate but is around $50 at the current black-market rate, which largely sets prices of goods for Venezuelans.\n?

The United States and Russia are studying possible ways to separate rival forces in Syria, delineating potential â€œsafe zonesâ€? for opposition fighters amid renewed violence that has threatened to fully collapse a two-month-old cease-fire attempt.\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry ? in Geneva on Monday for emergency meetings on the crisis ? said that the next 24 to 48 hours will be crucial in determining whether the plan will work.\nâ€œI donâ€™t want to make any promises that canâ€™t be kept,â€? he said.\n[ U.N. envoy fears â€œcatastrophicâ€? spiral in Aleppo ]\nKerry emphasized that the truce initially succeeded and continues in some parts of the country. But violence escalated recently, particularly in Aleppo, where at least 250 civilians have been killed over the past week, including staff and patients at a main hospital, largely by Syrian government airstrikes.\nâ€œThere are only two air forces flying in that particular area,â€? Kerry said, referring to the government and Russia, its primary backer. â€œThe Russians have been clear they are not flying.â€?\nRussia and the United States play important, but opposing, roles in Syria. Moscow last year sent in warplanes to help the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Washington and its regional partners, including Saudi Arabia, support some rebel factions seeking Assadâ€™s ouster.\n[ Gallery: Mourning and misery in Aleppo ]\nKerry spoke after meetings with the top U.N. envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, and Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. State Department officials said Kerry spoke to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, by phone. He planned to return to Washington on Monday evening.\nâ€œWe are trying in the next hours to see if it is possible to reach an agreement that can??. . . create a path forward for the cessation to hold so that there isnâ€™t one day of silence or two days of silence, but an ongoing process that relieves the people of Syria from this devastation, from this day-to-day killing machine that is being unleashed by the Assad regime,â€? he said.\nJust as the United States and its allies must â€œkeep our part of the bargainâ€? by ensuring the oppositionâ€™s compliance, Kerry said, â€œit is incumbent on Russia and Iran?. . . to make sure that the regime is living up to its part of this agreement.â€?\nDe Mistura, who spoke at Kerryâ€™s side after their meeting, said: â€œWe are preparing the mechanism, but the mechanism needs a political will. Otherwise, we will have only a mechanism. But that actually [is] being started today, preparing for a much better mechanism for monitoring and controlling a new cease-fire, but we need political will.â€?\nDe Mistura plans to visit Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the new plans.\nHe has said that nascent political talks between the opposition and the Syrian government to end the more than five-year-old conflict cannot continue unless the violence stops.\nKerry was vague on how the new plan would work or be enforced, saying only that Washington and Moscow had agreed to significantly increase the number of personnel monitoring the cease-fire that took effect Feb.?27.\nHe said they were working â€œintenselyâ€? to ensure that the task force does â€œa better job, with a better ability to enforceâ€? the cease-fire.\nThe safe zones under discussion, however, are not near the Turkish and Jordanian borders, which had been previously proposed by some regional leaders as possible no-fly zones. The Obama administration has consistently rejected using U.S. aircraft to protect such zones.\n[ Two sides of Aleppo: Destruction and dining out ]\nInstead, the plan would begin with areas in and around Aleppo and later expand to other regions to seek to divide opposition forces and the Syrian military.\nThat plan, its proponents hope, would also attempt to isolate militias loyal to Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaedaâ€™s Syrian affiliate, which is not covered by the cease-fire. The Syrian government and Russia have used the overlap of Jabhat al-Nusra and rebel forces in some areas to justify the renewed bombing.\nThe United States and its allies have rejected those claims, noting that much of the bombing has been against civilian areas with minimal rebel presence, as well as places universally recognized as out of bounds, such as hospitals.\nKerry acknowledged that the opposition also stepped up fighting and has been responsible for some of the recent carnage. But he insisted that the United States has upheld its end of the deal by urging U.S.-backed rebel factions to honor the truce.\nâ€œWe want to make sure that Russiaâ€? is doing the same with Assad, he said. â€œOne party is blatantly violatingâ€? the agreement.\nJubeir, whose government has supported some suspected Islamist groups and others in Syria, expressed strong doubt that Assad would comply with any plan that would stop airstrikes.\n[ A grim tour inside Syriaâ€™s chaos ]\nâ€œThe regime will not accept safe zones,â€? Jubeir said. He accused Assad of conducting â€œethnic cleansingâ€? in areas currently outside government control, including Aleppo.\nThe cease-fire was designed to provide space for the opposition and the Syrian government to hold political talks leading to a U.N.-backed transitional government, a new constitution and elections within 18?months.\nDe Mistura said last week that there has been some progress in the talks, although they have so far been held only in â€œproximity,â€? with representatives from the government and the opposition sitting in separate rooms while he and his staff shuttle between them.\nEarly last week, as the Aleppo attacks intensified, the opposition suspended its participation. There is no point in setting a date for resumption, de Mistura said, until the violence ends.\nIn his more negative view of a truce, Jubeir said Saudi Arabia continues to favor supplying the rebels with heavier arms, including ground-to-air-missiles ? an escalation in weaponry that the United States has long rejected.\nâ€œWe have said from Day One that the rebels should get all the weapons they need,â€? he said, specifically noting shoulder-launched missiles.\nAsked separately about recent indications of strains in U.S.-Saudi relations, Jubeir described the ties as â€œexcellent, very strong.â€?\nâ€œWe may have differences on tactical issuesâ€? over Syria and other regional matters, â€œbut our objectives are completely aligned.?. . . The American commitment to the security of Saudi Arabia is unshakable.â€?\nJubeir repeated his governmentâ€™s call for the release of 28 pages of classified documents from the FBIâ€™s investigation into the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudi citizens.\nWhile some members of Congress have said that the pages may prove official Saudi complicity in the attacks, both the administration and the Saudi government have rejected such claims and pointed to final investigative reports that labeled them without substance.\nâ€œSo many years have gone by, and everybody knows whatâ€™s in the 28 pages,â€? despite â€œa lot of innuendo and insinuations,â€? Jubeir said. â€œSo, yes, release the 28 pages. And it would be nice if, when you release the 28 pages, you release the rebuttal.â€?\nKaren DeYoung is associate editor and senior national security correspondent for the Washington Post.\nworld\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	World

Oliver said on the HBO show. â€œThatâ€™s right, this sentient circus peanut now holds the future of a major political party in his tiny, raccoon paw-sized hands ? which is frankly a little surprising because the Internet repeatedly told me I had â€˜destroyedâ€™ and â€˜evisceratedâ€™ him. Why would they say that if it wasnâ€™t true?â€?\nThen he?started in on?Duterte,?long-time mayor of the city of Davao on the island of Mindanao.\nDuterte, a former prosecutor, has been making headlines throughout the cycle for his brash and extreme stance on crime. If elected, Duterte has promised to kill?all the criminals in the country. He is a self-proclaimed womanizer and speaks often of his sexual exploits.\nFilipino presidential candidate and longtime Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte has stirred up contention with his brash, off-color statements on rape, extrajudicial killings and more. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\nOliver introduced Duterte as a â€œcolorful character, to say the least,â€? before playing an Al Jazeera segment showing the mayor?at a recent mass wedding. From the stage, he offered himself to the brides as a wedding gift.\nâ€œI donâ€™t have money to give, but I could give your wives something else, and this is for the wives only,â€? Duterte says. â€œMen, Iâ€™m sorry, but you donâ€™t get anything, because Iâ€™m not a queer.â€?\nOliver continues.\nâ€œThatâ€™s just the tip of the iceberg,â€? he says. â€œDuterte routinely kisses his female supporters, once called the pope â€˜a son of a bitch,â€™ all of which has earned him a reputation as the â€˜Trump of the East,â€™ a title previously held by a burnt wonton covered in scarecrow pubes.?Now, Duterte has also suggested if elected he would kill five criminals every week, which may not be an idle promise. Since heâ€™s been mayor, extrajudicial death squads have reportedly killed over 1,000 people, and while he denies any involvement in that, he does admit heâ€™s got blood on his hands.â€?\nThen Oliver cuts to a clip from a Duterte interview with Rappler reporter Maria Ressa.\nâ€œSo no qualms about killing killers?â€? she asks him.\nâ€œYes, of course, I must admit I have killed,â€? Duterte responds. â€œThree months early on, I killed about â€¦ ?three people.â€?\nâ€œIâ€™m sorry, about three people. Thatâ€™s not good!â€? Oliver shouts when the clip stops playing. â€œNot knowing how many people you killed is like not knowing how many Vicodin you took. If you donâ€™t know the exact number, the answer is way too â€¦ many.â€?\nâ€œAnd yet incredibly, none of this has hurt him,â€? Oliver says.\nPhilippine presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte gestures during a labor day campaign rally on May 1, 2016, in Manila. (Photo by Dondi Tawatao/Getty Images)\nAt the time of the showâ€™s taping, Duterte held an 11-point lead over his opponents. By Monday afternoon in the Philippines, exit polls indicated that Duterte would likely be the next president, according to reports .\nAll that, despite what may have been the mayorâ€™s most extreme comments of the campaign, which Oliver cued?up next.\nâ€œDuterte has seemed like he is trying to test the limits on basic human decency,â€? the host said.\nLast month during a rally in Quezon City, Duterte brought up an incident that occurred at the Davao jail during his first term as mayor in 1989, when an Australian missionary named Jacqueline Hamill was held hostage by inmates, who gang raped her before they slashed?her throat.\nâ€œI looked at her face, son of a b?-, she looks like a beautiful American actress. Son of a b?-, what a waste,â€? Duterte said . â€œWhat came to mind was, they raped her, they lined up. I was angry because she was raped, thatâ€™s one thing. But she was so beautiful, the mayor should have been first. What a waste.â€?\n[ Leading Philippine presidential contender: Gang rape victim â€˜so beautifulâ€™ he wishes he had â€˜been firstâ€™ ]\nLike much of the Internet and the Australian Embassy in the Philippines, Oliver was not amused.\n?â€œAnd if any part of you is thinking, was that some sort of horrific joke? Please know he meant every word of it.â€?\nThen Oliver cut to a clip of Duterte denying allegations that his comment was said in jest and telling reporters instead that he was merely repeating at the rally what he initially said in 1989:?â€œIt was not a joke. I said it in a narrative, I was not smiling. I was just talking plain sense.â€?\nNext, Oliver called the mayor a monster.\nâ€œAnd yet incredibly, incredibly, this man is leading in the polls by 11 points, so heâ€™s probably going to get elected president tomorrow, which isnâ€™t just terrifying for the Philippines, because it means that in just a yearâ€™s time, we could be treated to thisâ€? ? he said, pointing to an edited image of Trump and Duterte shaking hands in the Oval Office ??â€œas an official state visit.â€?\nMore from Morning Mix:\n	washingtonpost	World

(Bullit Marquez/AP)\nBy Michael Joe Delizo and Emily Rauhala May 9 at 3:35 PM Follow emilyrauhala\nMANILA ? Rodrigo Duterte, a brash and unflinchingly authoritarian mayor, looks poised to be the next president of the Philippines, building a seemingly insurmountable lead in Mondayâ€™s presidential election, according to unofficial partial results, and drawing a concession from a top rival.\nDuterte, who goes by nicknames such as â€œthe Punisherâ€? and â€œDuterte Harryâ€? ? a local twist on the movie lawman â€œDirty Harryâ€? ? was far ahead of four main rivals, winning nearly 40 percent of the vote, early returns showed. He was the heavy favorite heading into the election despite promising to kill suspected criminals and joking about rape . Final official results may take days.\nBut with most votes counted, one of Duterteâ€™s top challengers, Sen. Grace Poe, called him late Monday to concede, Philippine news media reported . Although she had denounced him as an â€œexecutionerâ€? during the campaign, Poe told reporters that voters have given him â€œa mandate,â€? adding, â€œLetâ€™s give him a chance.â€?\nDuterteâ€™s backers see him as a crime-busting savior.\nâ€œI think heâ€™ll bring about the change we all long for,â€? said Mhanwell Duran, 19, as he waited to cast his vote.\nFilipino presidential candidate and longtime Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte has stirred up contention with his brash, off-color statements on rape, extrajudicial killings and more. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\nCritics, though, worry about a return to the strongman politics of the past in a country that is one of Washingtonâ€™s closest allies in the region.\n[ Philippines race becomes U.S. punchline ]\nMore than 140,000 police officers and soldiers were deployed across the island nation to protect its voting centers, numbering about 36,000. The Philippines has a long tradition of election violence, fueled by lax law enforcement and politicians with private armies.\nJust before the polls opened, seven people were killed and one was wounded when armed men attacked a vehicle outside the capital, Manila. Chief Superintendent Wilben Mayor, a spokesman for the Philippine National Police, said the victims ? all supporters of a local mayor ? were shot in the head.\nThe race featuring Duterte and four challengers was fought primarily on domestic issues, including crime, corruption and transportation. With China pressing its claims in the South China Sea and the United States boosting its military role in the Philippines, foreign relations also loomed large.\nBut the contest came to be defined by Duterteâ€™s rhetorical fireworks. The 71-year-old has made headlines for, among other comments, calling Pope Francis â€œa son of a whoreâ€? in a predominantly Roman Catholic nation and saying that he wished he had â€œbeen firstâ€? to rape an Australian woman killed in a 1989 prison riot.\n[ American ships return to Subic Bay ]\nThere was even a promised stunt ? vowing to ride a Jet Ski to a disputed shoal in the South China Sea.\nThe longtime mayorâ€™s provocative comments have earned him comparisons to Donald Trump and tag lines such as â€œTrump of the East.â€?\nDuterte dislikes the notion ? â€œTrump is a bigot; I am not,â€? he said ? but he does not bristle at another word used to describe him: dictator. He said he would dissolve the countryâ€™s congress and install a â€œrevolutionary governmentâ€? if he needs to.\nâ€œI am a dictator? Yes, it is true,â€? he said.\nFor many in the Philippines, where the 1986 People Power Revolution ended three decades of dictatorial rule, the comment crossed a line. â€œYears of trying to put up a democratic state and we waste it for what?â€? asked Alisson Atis, a 26-year-old student. â€œFor one ruling body?â€?\nBut millions of others seem to gravitate to Duterteâ€™s combative ways, seeing him as a political outsider who can shake up the status quo.\nIn the Philippines, democracy is a family business. President Benigno Aquino III is the son of a former president. Presidential hopeful Manuel Roxas IIâ€™s grandfather once ruled the country. Among the candidates for vice president: Sen. Ferdinand R. â€œBongbongâ€? Marcos Jr., son of disgraced former ruler Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda Marcos.\nAlthough the country has had solid economic growth under Aquino, poverty and inequality persist. Many voters think that Aquino failed to deliver real change and are drawn to Duterteâ€™s big promises.\nâ€œThis is a fight against the administration,â€? said Edmund Tayao, a professor of political science at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila. â€œItâ€™s a protest vote because itâ€™s an anti-establishment vote.â€?\n[ Islamist militants behead Canadian hostage ]\nUnlike Aquino and others, Duterte made his name in the countryâ€™s less-developed south. He spent more than 20 years as the mayor of Davao, where he patrolled the streets on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and gave interviews with a pistol tucked in his waistband.\nAs mayor, he made tackling crime his signature issue, but his law-and-order campaigns included the summary execution of criminals. A 2015 Human Rights Watch report traced the rise of Davaoâ€™s â€œdeath squad mayor.â€?\nRather than distance himself from the title during the campaign, Duterte seemed to welcome it, musing about his plans to â€œkill allâ€? criminals and feed their bodies to fish. He has promised to eliminate crime and corruption in six months if he becomes president.\nOn foreign policy, Duterte is seen as something of a wild card. The next president faces the unenviable task of trying to balance China as it presses its maritime claims off the Philippine coast and to safeguard the countryâ€™s alliance with the United States, which seeks to increase its military presence in the area in response.\nIn addition to his Jet Ski plan, Duterte has said that he would consider putting aside differences with China if Beijing offered some big-ticket railway projects on his home island of Mindanao.\nAssuming he holds his lead in the final tally, the question is how Duterte plans to deliver on his tough talk. â€œHis cabinet members will have many things to do in terms of giving him advice more or less consistent to the national interest, because he is not really into national policy,â€? Ramon Casiple, executive director of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, said in Manila.\nâ€œBut the problem is,â€? Casiple added, â€œhe is not listening to his advisers . . . when they are telling him to shut his mouth.â€?\nRauhala reported from Beijing.\n	washingtonpost	World

But Binay, who is running fourth in opinion polls ahead of May 9, 2016 presidential elections, is battling another image he says is a political smear - that of a corrupt bureaucrat who built a fortune from government coffers. (Bullit Marquez, File/Associated Press)\nBy Teresa Cerojano | AP May 5\nMANILA, Philippines ? In a poor Southeast Asian country with a soft spot for the underdog, Philippine Vice President Jejomar Binay has tried to turn online jokes about his dark complexion and small stature to his advantage by portraying himself in campaign ads as an everyman who understands the struggles of the underclass.\nBut Binay, who is running fourth in opinion polls ahead of Mondayâ€™s presidential elections, is battling another image he says is a political smear ? that of a corrupt bureaucrat who built a fortune from government coffers.\nThe countryâ€™s ombudsman plans to file corruption charges against Binay, 73, after he finishes his term of vice president based on an investigation into several contracts with alleged irregularities while he was mayor of Makati City, the countryâ€™s premiere financial district, including a 2.7 billion peso ($58.7 million) parking building.\nImages of his sprawling hacienda, with its air-conditioned pig farm, horse ranch, orchid farm and a garden inspired by Londonâ€™s Kew Palace also were splashed on television screens during the year-long Senate investigation.\nBinay denies amassing ill-gotten wealth, saying the contracts are in order, and his assets were mainly from the pig business he started in 1994 and the sale of properties he owned before he was elected mayor of Makati, which lies within metro Manila, in 1988.\nThe corruption talk is part of a â€œdemolition jobâ€? and remain â€œmere allegations,â€? Binay told The Associated Press. â€œWhat I have done is I have uplifted the lives of everyone in Makati and I was able to make our city the richest (in the country).â€?\nHe boasts that Makati takes care of its residents from cradle to grave, offering free hospitalization, education, burial and senior citizensâ€™ welfare. As a politician, he has cultivated ties with common people. He is known for attending wakes ? 60,000 as of his last count ? weddings, offering scholarships and donating money to the poor.\nBinay supporter Leticia Toralba, a 57-year-old mother of six, says she doesnâ€™t care about the corruption allegations because he has offered financial help to her family and others outside his city. Two of her childrenâ€™s education was covered by scholarships that Binay maintains in several colleges.\nâ€œWe owe him a big debt of gratitude,â€? said Toralba as she and some 200 supporters waited in the stifling heat for Binay to speak from a makeshift stage in Manilaâ€™s San Andres district. â€œWe donâ€™t care about the allegations of corruption against him. Even if he is corrupt as long as he is able to help the people, as long as he gives the money to the poor that is OK.â€?\nAs she spoke, Binayâ€™s campaign song blared from two huge speakers, declaring that only Binay can make life better and who sends the poor to school. His television ads also say the poor can rely on â€œnognogâ€? and â€œpandakâ€? ? pejorative tags that some have used in social media to refer to his dark skin and 5â€™3 feet (1.6 meter) height. By embracing those terms, Binay is identifying with the rural folk and working class who toil under the hot sun.\nBinay ? whose first name is a contraction of Jesus, Joseph and Mary ? comes from humble beginnings.\nOrphaned at a young age, he was raised by his uncle and used to feed the pigs in the backyard. He supported himself through law school, and joined street protests in the 1980s against dictator Ferdinand Marcos, serving as lawyer to Marcosâ€™ human rights victims.\nWhile he was a friend of President Benigno Aquinoâ€™s family for a long time, they ran on different tickets in 2010 and have since had a falling out. In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately.\nBinay declared his intention to run for president years ago, and surveys in 2014 showed him at the top of the heap. But his popularity has steadily declined as his image became tarnished by the corruption inquiry. The latest polls suggest Rodrigo Duterte, mayor of the southern city of Davao, is favored to win.\nâ€œIn many ways Binay was a disaster waiting to happen precisely because he was on top of the game way before the official campaign started,â€? said Jayeel Cornelio, director of Ateneo de Manila Universityâ€™s Development Studies Program. â€œBecause he started too early, thinking that it would catapult him to the presidency, that eventually backfired because he opened himself up for all these attacks.â€?\nBut with his low poll numbers, Binayâ€™s political career may be nearing its end, although his family dynasty may survive, Cornelio said.\nâ€œThe truth is trial by publicity works in this country and at the end of the day itâ€™s really all about the reputation,â€? he added.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Jes Aznar/For The Washington Post)\nSUBIC BAY, Philippines ? The newest bar to grace this former U.S. military base is painted with American flags and shaded by a scaled-down Statue of Liberty.\nNearly 25 years ago, Philippine politicians fought to expel U.S. forces stationed here, vowing to â€œunchainâ€? the country from its former colonial master, promising a future free of girly bars and foreign domination. Now, with Chinese ships cruising just off the coast, the Americans are back, chowing down on chicken tenders and drinking Budweisers served by the Liberty Sports Bar and Grillâ€™s waitresses clad in red, white and blue.\nLibertyâ€™s owner, Mark Lindsay, 48, set up shop on the dock five months ago, betting that closer military ties between the United States and the Philippines would revive this once-wild port. Since then, heâ€™s seen a steady rise in ships and sailors, with pit stops by U.S. war and supply vessels, an Ohio-class guided-missile submarine and, most recently, a Japanese aircraft carrier on a four-day â€œgoodwill visit.â€?\nâ€œThe more military the better, the more ships the better,â€? he said.\nMark Lindsey, 48, owner of the Liberty Sports Bar and Grill in Subic, Philippines. His bar is just a few steps away from where sailors come out after disembarking their ship for rest and recreation. (Jes Aznar/For The Washington Post)\nThe U.S. return to Subic is a symbol of the strategic shift sweeping Asia and a flash point heading into the Philippinesâ€™ presidential election on Monday.\nA resurgent China claims nearly all of the South China Sea as its â€œinherentâ€? territory based on maps with a U-shaped, nine-dash line that scoops deep into exclusive maritime economic zones claimed by the likes of the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. In recent years, Beijing has built up islands across the area, stacking a growing number of outposts with civilian and military infrastructure.\nChinaâ€™s posture is bringing the Philippines and the United States back together. This year, the Philippines moved forward with the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA, which allows the U.S. military to build facilities at five Philippine bases and is likely to mean more hardware at Subic Bay, which is now technically a commercial, not a military port.\nThat means U.S. and Chinese ships sailing in close proximity, deepening an already tense and dangerous standoff. For the Philippines, it raises tough questions about how the next administration should balance big powers while protecting Philippine sovereignty and fragile economic gains .\nâ€œTheir challenge is to normalize relations with China in a way that doesnâ€™t look like they are caving in,â€? said Jay L. Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippinesâ€™ Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea.\nResidents boarding a boat in a fishing village in Subic, Philippines. (Jes Aznar/For The Washington Post)\nSubic Bayâ€™s deep, sheltered harbor has long been prized by foreign fleets.\nThe Spanish navy authorized the construction of the Arsenal de Olongapo in the 1880s, and the Americans moved in after the war with Spain in 1898. During the Vietnam War, it was a notoriously raucous â€œrest and relaxationâ€? hub for millions of U.S. troops.\nWhen the United States was pushed out in 1992, China was seen as a foreign-policy pipsqueak, more concerned with bolstering its gross domestic product than gaining a strategic edge. But three years later, Beijing built what it called fishing shelters on Mischief Reef, in the contested Spratly Islands.\nâ€œWhen they reclaimed it, we thought what will they do with this?â€? said Justice Antonio Carpio of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. â€œNow itâ€™s bigger than some of the cities in the Philippines, with room for air and naval forces.â€?\nIn 2012, with Xi Jinping ascendant in Beijing, China and the Philippines were caught in a standoff over the Scarborough Shoal , a cluster of rocks and reefs west of Subic Bay. China eventually seized control of the area, changing the Philippinesâ€™ thinking on dealing with Beijing, said Richard Javad Heydarian, an assistant professor of political science at Manilaâ€™s De La Salle University.\nLights coming from the port area of the SBMA compound, a former U.S. base in Subic, Philippines, are reflected on the waters of the bay. (Jes Aznar/For The Washington Post)\nâ€œThe Philippines realized we misread this guy; we thought he was Uncle Xi the nice guy, but we learned that Uncle Xi can be even feistier than Uncle Sam.â€?\nThe return of U.S. troops under EDCA maddens Beijing. â€œThe U.S. military keeps talking about the so-called militarization in the South China Sea,â€? Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for Chinaâ€™s Foreign Ministry, said at a news conference in March. â€œMaybe they can explain whether their increased military deployment in the South China Sea and nearby areas is an action of militarization or not.â€?\nIn the wake of the deal ? and in the run-up to a ruling by an international tribunal on the South China Sea ? U.S. and Philippine military experts increasingly use the term â€œred lineâ€? to discuss the prospect of new Chinese construction on Scarborough Shoal. They refer to it as the â€œlast strawâ€? and worry that China plans to turn the area into a military base.\nWith just days to go before the Philippines picks a new president, the question now is how the next leader will proceed, either sticking with the course charted by President Benigno Aquino III, who compared the Peopleâ€™s Republic to Nazi Germany and has been frozen out by Beijing, or somehow opening the door for better China ties without alienating the Americans.\nThe current front-runner, the tough-talking Rodrigo Duterte, has said he would consider talking to Beijing if the Chinese built a railroad in his home region. He also suggested that he would ride a personal watercraft to the Scarborough Shoal to plant the Philippine flag.\nChallengers Grace Poe, a rookie senator who spent years living in the United States, and Manuel Roxas II, Aquinoâ€™s chosen successor and a Wharton-educated grandson of a former president, have both suggested that they would press ahead with the legal challenge launched by the current administration.\nâ€œThe overall direction looks set,â€? said Yanmei Xie, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Groupâ€™s Beijing office. â€œThat means pulling close to the U.S., Japan and other allies, continuing to carry out the arbitration case and trying to compel China to respect the ruling.â€?\nLocals watch performers on stage at the Pier One bar inside the former U.S. base. (Jes Aznar/For The Washington Post)\nIn Subic, for now, that means more ships and thirsty sailors ? for better and for worse.\nThose who oppose the sex trade and the violence that often trails it are wary of a U.S. return, remembering the 2014 murder of a transgender woman, Jennifer Laude, by a U.S. Marine.\nFor many others here, the economic benefit of visitors is paramount, and they see boom times ahead for the former base. Said Lindsay, the owner of Liberty: â€œIf China keeps at it, business will be great.â€?\n	washingtonpost	World

Tensions in the South China Sea are rising, pitting China against smaller and weaker neighbors that all lay claim to islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters rich in fish and potential gas and oil reserves. Chinaâ€™s recent construction of artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago, complete with airstrips and radar stations, and U.S. patrols challenging Beijingâ€™s vast territorial claims, have caused concern that the strategically important waters could become a flashpoint. (Cha Chunming/Xinhua via AP, File) NO SALES (Associated Press)\nBy Associated Press May 9 at 8:30 PM\nA look at some recent key developments in the South China Sea, where China is pitted against smaller neighbors in territorial disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters rich in fish and potential gas and oil reserves:\n___\nEDITORâ€™S NOTE: This is a weekly look at the latest key developments in the South China Sea, home to several territorial conflicts that have raised tensions in the region.\n___\nSINGING TO THE TROOPS\nChinaâ€™s navy has launched annual war drills in the South China Sea with one of its most advanced warships, the missile destroyer Hefei.\nThe exercises include simulations for breaking an enemy blockade and reconnaissance drills with submarine forces. Five other guided-missile destroyers, a frigate and a supply ship of the South Sea Fleet based in Sanya on Hainan Island, home to a major naval and air force base, are taking part.\nAccording to the official Xinhua News Agency, the ships will be joined by forces based in the Spratly and Paracel islands, where China has embarked on massive island-building to expand and reinforce the reefs it controls in the disputed region.\nAlso last week, China sent famed singer of patriotic anthems Song Zuying on a tour of its man-made islands in the Spratlys to entertain troops and underscore confidence in asserting its claim in the contested area.\nAmong the songs performed: â€œOde to the South Sea Defenders,â€? whose lyrics speak of â€œtroops of stout men with guns in their hands who battle the wind and fight the waves to guard the nationâ€™s door.â€?\nPhotos of the performances also offered a rare glimpse of the extensive work China has been carrying out at Fiery Cross Reef, showing lighthouses, harbors and buildings. In the background of some can be seen one of the navyâ€™s massive Type 071 amphibious dock ships, capable of carrying four helicopters and as many as 800 troops.\n___\nRIVALS IN JOINT EXERCISES\nBeijing has also sent the Lanzhou missile-guided destroyer that took part in Beijingâ€™s South China Sea drills for a multinational exercise that started last week off the waters of Brunei and Singapore. It joined the navies of the 10 countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, along with those of the U.S., India and six other dialogue partners for a maritime security and counterterrorism exercise.\nSeveral ASEAN members, including Vietnam and the Philippines, have claims in the South China Sea.\nThe drills include a land-storming exercise. The U.S. is participating with a P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft, the destroyer USS Stethem and Army units.\nâ€œOur crew will be able to see firsthand how other navies operate and we can learn from them while sharing our own operational tactics and procedures,â€? said Cmdr. Harry Marsh, commanding officer of the Stethem.\n___\nPORT VISIT DENIAL A â€˜MINOR HURDLEâ€™\nThe commander of the U.S. Navyâ€™s 7th Fleet says the cancellation of a planned port visit to Hong Kong by an American aircraft carrier is just a â€œminor hurdleâ€? in relations between the two militaries.\nVice Adm. Joseph Aucoin spoke Friday in Chinaâ€™s financial hub of Shanghai after the docking of the USS Blue Ridge, the fleetâ€™s command ship, whose visit he said indicated the durability of the China-U.S. military-to-military relationship.\nThe U.S. State Department said last month that China recently denied a request for the USS John C. Stennis to visit Hong Kong, in an apparent sign of mounting tension in the disputed South China Sea. China hasnâ€™t explained the reason for the cancellation, but previous cancellations have been linked to tensions over Taiwan or other political and military disputes.\nAucoin said he didnâ€™t know why the visit was denied, although Defense Secretary Ash Carter and his Philippine counterpart had visited the carrier in the South China Sea two weeks earlier, irking Beijing. The reason â€œwould probably be a good question for the government of China,â€? he said.\nâ€œBut the very fact that weâ€™re on this pier, that our two navies, our two countries, donâ€™t let that minor hurdle get in the way of our relationships. Our, the relationship between our two countries is much too important for a port visit to get in the way of that,â€? Aucoin told reporters.\n___\nU.S. WORRY: â€˜A MISCALCULATIONâ€™\nThe U.S. Coast Guard commandant said the Chinese coast guard is on the front line provoking the U.S. Navy.\nâ€œWe are seeing Chinese fishing trawlers provoking the United States Navy, carrying out sovereign acts, but just over the horizon is the PLA,â€? said Adm. Paul Zukunft, referring to the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army.\nâ€œSo our biggest concern is about a miscalculation. But their coast guard has not been transparent in terms of what their intent is,â€? he said at a discussion at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nHe said the U.S. was working with its Chinese counterparts on a code of conduct for armed planned encounters at sea â€œso they wonâ€™t take these actions against our Navy and other forces as well.â€?\nâ€œOur sense is that China does not want to be a global hegemon, but they clearly want to be recognized as the regional leader in this area,â€? he said.\nAdm. John Richardson, chief of naval operations, said at the same forum that the Navyâ€™s freedom of navigation operations ? sailing warships close to Chinese man-made islands ? are working. Their aim is to advocate for an international set of rules that ensures the free flow of goods and services in one of the worldâ€™s busiest shipping lanes, he said.\nâ€œThey donâ€™t extend beyond that. Thereâ€™s just a pure advocacy for that system. So we design those very carefully. Itâ€™s a policy decision that is made, interwoven with those other elements of power. So I think both aircraft, ships are ready to execute those as they fit into the plan,â€? he said.\nChina has criticized Washington, saying it is trying to provoke conflict with such maneuvers. But Beijing also says it wonâ€™t impede free navigation.\n___\nLAST WORD\nâ€œThe case brought by the Philippines is nothing but a political farce under the cloak of law. ... It is a grave threat to regional peace and stability.â€? ?

President Xi Jinping already broke a promise he made to Mr. Obama not to militarize islets his regime has been building up in two parts of the South China Sea. Now Beijing appears to be contemplating building a base on a contested shoal just 150 miles from Subic Bay in the Philippines. A failure by the administration to prevent this audacious step could unravel much of what it has done to bolster U.S. influence in the region.\nChinese development of Scarborough Shoal, a collection of rocks and coral reefs it seized from the Philippines four years ago, would escalate its already-belligerent behavior in the South China Sea in a number of ways. Until now, Beijingâ€™s landfill work and construction of airstrips have occurred on islets it already controlled that are considerably closer to the Chinese mainland. Scarborough Shoal lies about 500 miles from China . A base there could allow Chinese radar and missiles to threaten Manila, as well as Philippine bases where U.S. forces are positioned.\nPerhaps most importantly, the Chinese venture would concretize Beijingâ€™s refusal to abide by international law in resolving territorial disputes with its neighbors. The Philippines responded to the seizure of Scarborough Shoal by filing a case with a U.N. tribunal . A ruling by the panel, expected in the coming weeks, could reject Chinaâ€™s expansive claim to 80 percent of the South China Sea, based on a â€œ nine-dash line â€? dating to the 1940s. Acts that defy that ruling, in turn, would suggest that Mr. Xi intends to use brute force to advance Chinaâ€™s claims across the region.\nThe Obama administration has been trying to head off the Chinese action. Most notably, it has significantly expanded military cooperation with the Philippines, providing millions of dollars in new aid and agreeing on the placement of U.S. assets on five bases there. Last month, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter ended 11 days of U.S.-Philippine military exercises by announcing that the two nations would conduct joint air and maritime patrols. Soon afterward, defense officials announced that U.S. planes flew near Scarborough Shoal on three different days.\nThe question is whether this will be enough. In a congressional hearing last month , senators from both parties questioned the administrationâ€™s limited use of freedom-of-navigation operations, in which U.S. ships sail near disputed territories claimed by China; according to the Wall Street Journal, the White House canceled one patrol last month in an attempt to â€œ lower the temperature â€? over Scarborough.\nDeputy Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken assured the senators that â€œwe have been very actively and very aggressively messaging China privately and publicly.â€? But he also offered an all-too-familiar Obama administration analysis: Chinaâ€™s aggressive moves, he said, would be self-defeating, because they would have â€œthe net effect of surrounding itself with increasingly angry, increasingly suspicious neighbors who are increasingly close to the United States.â€?\nThat is true enough, for now. But if the administration fails to stop a Chinese buildup on Scarborough Shoal, its allies are likely to conclude that alliance with Washington is useless.\nRead more on this topic:\n	washingtonpost	World

(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\nOvernight, the Philippines elected a new president. Rodrigo Duterte, mayor of Davao City, appears to have won enough votes to earn the title, an achievement that comes thanks in part to his tough-on-crime policies.\nAnd by "tough on crime," I mean "murder criminals." Duterte's seemingly sincere proposal for dealing with criminals is to simply execute them ??a practice that he apparently undertook in Davao. He's said that he'll just pardon himself for the executions as he gets ready to leave office.\nThat's if he leaves office. He's also referred to himself as a "dictator," which bodes poorly. Then there was the time that he lamented that he hadn't gotten the chance to rape a woman who was killed in a hostage situation in the Davao jail. "I was angry because she was raped, thatâ€™s one thing," he said. "But she was so beautiful, the mayor should have been first. What a waste."\nFor Americans, the analogy didn't take long to arise: Duterte became "the Donald Trump of the Philippines " or " Trump of the East ," as The Washington Post noted over the weekend. Duterte is obviously more extreme than Trump, though he rejects the comparison for another reason. "Trump is a bigot," he has said . "I am not."\nSince Trump's infamous escalator glide in?June, there's been a booming market for declaring people or things to be "the Donald Trump of" something or somewhere.

Duterte told Agence France-Presse, the French news agency, as the results came in.\nBut Duterteâ€™s rise has been anything but humble and quiet, with the longtime mayor making international headlines for threatening to kill suspected criminals , joking about the rape and murder of a missionary, and promising to ride a Jet Ski to plant a Philippine flag on disputed reefs.\n[ As Philippines picks new president, â€˜the Punisherâ€™ looks poised to win ]\nFor his legions of fans in the Philippines, Duterteâ€™s brash comments are as appealing as his promise to completely stamp out crime and corruption in just six months. They see him as a superman ready to challenge the status quo and willing to stand up for the little guy.\nIn the Philippines, presidential candidate and longtime Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte has stirred up contention with his brash, off-color statements on rape, extrajudicial killings and more. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\nTo his critics within and beyond the country, including in the United States, Duterteâ€™s win is worrisome. They wonder how the man Human Rights Watch dubbed â€œ the death squad mayor â€? will handle domestic and international policy, and are concerned about the return to the country of strongman politics .\nOne of the biggest unknowns is his China policy. â€œForeign relations has been a major gap in Duterteâ€™s published platform to date, and he and his team have yet to publicly define their approach to the South China Sea,â€? said Jay L. Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippinesâ€™ Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea.\nChina claims nearly all of the South China Sea as its â€œinherentâ€? territory, based on maps that scoop into exclusive maritime economic zones claimed by the Philippines and others. In recent years, Beijing has built up islands across the area, adding civilian and military infrastructure to the outposts.\nPresident Benigno Aquino III took a hard line with Beijing ? once comparing China to Nazi Germany ? and found himself frozen out.\nWith Chinese ships pressing farther south, Aquino moved to ramp up military cooperation with the United States. A defense pact upheld this year allows the U.S. military to build facilities at five Philippine bases, and more ships already are stopping by the former U.S. naval base at Subic Bay.\nThe deal, signed in the run-up to a ruling on the South China Sea by an international tribunal, will put more U.S. ships and troops in close proximity with Chinese forces, deepening the standoff.

I donâ€™t believe in solving the conflict through an international tribunal,â€? he said.\nHe also expressed support for bilateral talks with Beijing and suggested the possibility of joint exploration of the areaâ€™s natural resources. â€œIf negotiations will be in still waters in one or two years, I will talk to the Chinese,â€? he said.\nBeijing has been calling for bilateral talks with its South China Sea neighbors, one by one.

Though Beijing has been characteristically quiet on how it plans to engage Duterte, it is no doubt pleased by his apparent willingness to strike a deal.\nOn Tuesday, the English-language edition of Global Times, an organ of the ruling Communist Party of China, accused Manila and the media of â€œhypingâ€? the political dimensions of the conflict at the expense of economic concerns.\nAn editorial in the same paper struck a similar tone, noting that the Philippine public â€œcares most about livelihoods, and nationalistic slogans cannot feed them.â€?\nThe piece blasted Aquino but expressed optimism about Duterteâ€™s ability to change Manilaâ€™s â€œunscrupulous policy toward China.â€?\nâ€œIf there is anything that can be changed by Duterte, it will be diplomacy,â€? it stated.\nHis challenge will be engaging China without alienating the United States.\nIf Duterte pushes ahead with joint development agreements or bilateral talks, he will need to tread carefully, said Richard Javad Heydarian, an assistant professor of political science at Manilaâ€™s De La Salle University.\nâ€œGiven strong domestic anti-China sentiment and institutionalized security ties with America,â€? he said, â€œDuterte will have to keep Washington ? a key strategic partner ? on [his] side.â€?\nRead more\n	washingtonpost	World

Opponents of the law say it is discriminatory and is causing significant economic harm to the state: Hundreds of millions of federal dollars could get yanked, at least two companies canceled expansion plans, and the law has put NCAA tournament games at risk. Supporters say the intention of the law has been distorted, that it simply makes sense and protects peoplesâ€™ privacy.\nAnd the university system, dependent on federal funding that could be cut off if officials comply with state law, is caught squarely in the middle.\nThe president of the UNC system, Margaret Spellings, said in a letter Monday that they are in a difficult spot , caught between federal and state law. The situation is even more complicated by unsettled case law, and shifting cultural mores.\n[ UNC president says they are caught between dueling federal and state directives on â€œbathroom law" ]\nOn Tuesday evening, Spellings, a former U.S. education secretary under?President George W. Bush, issued a statement that said, â€œThe University of North Carolina is about providing high-quality educational opportunities to all. We depend on federal funding to help provide this access. In fact, more than 138,000 of our students?representing all 100 North Carolina counties and all UNC institutions?receive some type of federal aid. Because of this, we take the legal questions surrounding HB2 and the related lawsuits seriously. We intend to remain in close communication with state and federal officials to underscore our shared interest in resolving these difficult issues as quickly as possible so that we can refocus our efforts on educating students.â€?\nThe UNC Board of Governors Chairman Lou Bissette said in a statement, â€œThe purpose of todayâ€™s Board meeting was to consult with our attorneys concerning the pending litigation involving the Department of Justice. We support all the actions President Spellings has taken thus far in leading the University and responding to HB2. The Board appreciates and values her ongoing leadership.\nâ€œAs she said yesterday, the University is in a difficult position?caught in the middle between state and federal law.?We are committed to resolving the legal issues in the Universityâ€™s favor as quickly as possible. In the meantime, we are going to continue to focus on our primary mission of educating students.â€?\nLast week federal officials, arguing that the stateâ€™s transgender â€œbathroom lawâ€? violates federal civil rights protections, ordered North Carolina officials not to comply with it. The U.S. Department of Justice told the UNC system that it must reject the law, which requires people to use the bathrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificates, regardless of the gender with which they identify. The department warned North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) that the state risked losing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding if the law were not disavowed by Monday.\n[ Justice Dept. to North Carolina: Law limiting protections for LGBT people violates federal law ]\nMcCrory responded by filing a lawsuit Monday, accusing the federal government of overreach. â€œThis is an attempt to unilaterally rewrite long-established federal civil rights laws,â€? the complaint argued. He has said the law is not discriminatory and that the Obama administration is trying to force high schools to let boys use girlsâ€™ bathrooms.\nThe Justice Department countered with a lawsuit filed Monday afternoon, calling it an important civil-rights issue akin to the laws that barred black people from entering bathrooms designated for white people.\n[ North Carolina, Justice Dept. file dueling lawsuits ]\nThe 10 Republican congressmen from North Carolina wrote to the U.S. secretary of education Monday, asking for an assurance by Friday that federal funds will not be withheld from the state. They wrote that the Obama administration is choosing to define discrimination on the basis of sex to include discrimination based on gender identity, although the Title IX act does not specify gender identity. They called the threat to cut funding â€œwithout legal merit and an unprecedented overreach by the federal government.â€?\nThe University of North Carolina system Faculty Assembly sent a letter to McCrory Monday night that read, in part, â€œIt is the considered judgment of the UNC Faculty Assembly that the provisions of House Bill 2?constitute an ill-advised legislative intervention in the governance of the University of North?Carolina and its constituent institutionsâ€¦.\nâ€œHouse Bill 2 undermines the principles the office of the Governor is duty-bound to uphold. It is the?considered advice and counsel of the UNC Faculty Assembly that you make every effort to mitigate,?if not negate, the effects of this ill-advised and unnecessary interference in the governance of the?University.â€?\nThe Faculty Assembly resolution stated that discrimination â€œis antithetical to the freedoms required for the pursuit of academic excellenceâ€¦â€?\nFaculty resolutions in opposition to the law were passed at 11 of the 17 campuses, and discussions are underway at the other six.\nHere are?the full letter to the governor and the faculty actions:\nHere is the letter from House Republicans:\n?\n	washingtonpost	World

(Reuters)\nOn Monday, there was a remarkable moment at the Department of Justice: two women of color who had personally experienced the pain of prejudice walked to the podium?to announce the Justice Departmentâ€™s discrimination lawsuit against the state of North Carolina.\nThe two top Justice Department officials ? one the daughter of Indian immigrants and the other the granddaughter of a â€œdirt poorâ€? sharecropper and minister in the deep South ? linked the growing controversy over transgender access to restrooms in North Carolina to the civil rights battles of the 1960s.\nâ€œIt was not so very long ago that states, including North Carolina, had signs above restrooms, water fountains and on public accommodations,â€? said Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, a native of North Carolina, in perhaps the most impassioned speech she has given since taking the reins of the Justice Department last year.?â€œWe have moved beyond those dark days, but not without pain and suffering and an ongoing fight to keep moving forward. Let us write a different story this time.â€?\nLynchâ€™s father, 84-year-old Lorenzo Lynch, is a retired fourth-generation Baptist minister who grew up in the segregated South where every aspect of his life was touched by Jim Crow laws. Ministers driving to other states to preach could not stop and use the bathroom. Her grandfather, who had a third-grade education, would help hide?people who got in trouble but had no recourse under the Jim Crow laws in the?rural south, where Lynch once said that â€œthere was no justice in the dark of night on a rural road.â€?\nU.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, left, and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departmentâ€™s civil rights division, announce a civil rights lawsuit against North Carolina, at the U.S. Department of Justice. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nVanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departmentâ€™s civil rights division, said that calling the new North Carolina law a bathroom bill â€œtrivializes what this is really about.â€?\nâ€œThe complaint we filed today speaks to public employees who feel afraid and stigmatized on the job,â€? Gupta said. â€œIt speaks to students who feel like their campus treats them differently because of who they are. It speaks to sports fans who feel forced to choose between their gender identity and their identity as a Tar Heel. And it speaks to all of us who have ever been made to feel inferior ? like somehow we just donâ€™t belong in our community, like somehow we just donâ€™t fit in.â€?\nGuptaâ€™s parents immigrated to the United States from India in the late 1960s, but she spent some of her childhood in England and France because her father worked for an international company. She has recalled to reporters ?an incident when she was 4?and was in a McDonaldâ€™s in London with her parents and a grandmother visiting from India. A group of skinheads came in, yelled â€œGo home Pakis!â€? They then threw french fries and other food at Gupta and her family until Gupta, her parents and her grandmother left.\nGupta, a graduate of Yale University and New York Universityâ€™s law school, has devoted her career to civil rights issues and criminal justice reform as an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union. Lynch, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, was a career prosecutor and U.S. attorney before becoming attorney general in April, 2015.\nLynch and Gupta are also clashing with North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) over his stateâ€™s 2013 voting law, one of the strictest in the country. A federal judge last month upheld the law, and Lynch said Monday that the Justice Department is joining civil rights groups to appeal his decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.\nBefore Lynch and Gupta announced their lawsuit, McCrory sued the Justice Department on Monday morning, accusing the federal government of â€œbaseless and blatant overreach.â€? The governor has repeatedly defended the state law, which he signed in March in response to a city ordinance in Charlotte that expanded civil rights protections for people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The new law requires transgender people to use bathrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificates.\nOn May 9, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced dueling lawsuits regarding HB2, a law that requires people to use public restrooms according to the sex they were assigned at birth, rather than the one they identify with. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\nCiting federal laws, Gupta said the law sexually discriminates against transgender people, and its proponents are misinterpreting or making up facts about gender identity.\nâ€œHere are the facts,â€? Gupta said sternly. â€œTransgender men are men ? they live, work and study as men. Transgender women are women ? they live, work and study as women.â€?\nGroups supporting the law and similar legislation across the country refer to them as â€œbathroom bills.â€? The groups have raised the concern that men would enter womenâ€™s restrooms for perverse or harmful reasons.?McCrory said the issue will have affect not only North Carolina, but also other states across the country, and accused the government of â€œbeing a bully.â€?\nAfter Lynchâ€™s news?conference, McCroryâ€™s spokesman said the attorney general was â€œusing divisive rhetoric.â€?\nâ€œGovernor McCrory is appropriately seeking legal certainty to a complex issue impacting employers and students throughout the country,â€? said McCrory spokesman Josh Ellis.\nLynch made it clear Monday that North Carolina is at risk of losing millions in federal?funding.?North Carolina, for example, receives more than $4 billion in federal education funding each year, much of it in the form of student loans, and the Education Department is now reviewing whether to withhold that money.\nâ€œLet me speak now to the people of the great state, the beautiful state, my state of North Carolina,â€? Lynch said. â€œYouâ€™ve been told that this law protects vulnerable populations from harm, but that just is not the case. Instead, what this law does is inflict further indignity on a population that has already suffered far more than its fair share.â€?\nThe Freddie Gray case\nSign up for email updates on the trials.\nYouâ€™ve signed up for email updates on this story.\nSign up\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	World

(Reuters)\nThere is more than a smidgen of irony in the man who likened?Obamacare to slavery taking issue with the historical comparisons?offered by, well, just about anyone. Ben Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon, is also the U.S. presidential candidate who declared it impossible for one to be a practicing Muslim and a loyal and diligent president of the United States. He is also the one-time presidential contender who claimed that the Holocaust could have been prevented if German Jews had simply been more heavily armed in Nazi-era Germany. Perhaps Carson is, as the New Yorker magazine suggested , a man of medicine who could have benefited from a few more courses outside the science department.\nYet for reasons conservative news and information outlets need to explain, it is Carson we see and hear everywhere weighing in against Attorney General Loretta Lynch's comparison between conflicts about transgender bathroom laws and the ugly constellation of policies known as Jim Crow . The truth is that there is nothing about Lynch's historical reference to Jim Crow that is not spot-on.\nWhat Lynch, a North Carolina native, said is that states and institutions that have long and not at all auspicious histories of failing to recognize what functional equality means, how it functions, what it looks like and what policies sustain or damage that cause, must recognize that so-called bathroom laws?like North Carolina's represent an effort to retrench from social change, to retreat from expanded legal provisions for equality.\nWhat?Lynch said was, in fact, rather solicitous in her description of the discomfort some Americans feel with vast social changes that have taken shape in the years since the Supreme Court has repeatedly acknowledged that Americans' constitutional equality extends to matters related to gender and sexuality. What Lynch said was that said discomfort does not and cannot outweigh U.S. law. And state policies that attempt to contravene it cannot be abided.\nHere is the indisputable truth: Jim Crow was not, in fact, simply a natural state of affairs or set of traditions that a set of unruly, anti-social, particularly liberal or impatient people suddenly decided must be overturned and brought to an end. Jim Crow was a system of?laws, policies and?social practices shaped in direct response to -- or more accurately, created and sustained as a means to roll back -- the social and legal changes that occurred in the United States after the emancipation of ?the country's slaves.\nIn this period, known as Reconstruction, African Americans registered to vote, were elected to Congress and made economic and educational progress. Jim Crow laws made much of that increasingly impossible and gave continued force and meaning to pervasive notions of white moral and intellectual superiority.\nTo put that more bluntly, Jim Crow stood in direct contradiction to the U.S. Constitution but was justified by the supposed threat posed to white Americans -- particularly white women and children -- by the unrestrained presence and increasingly equal treatment of black Americans -- particularly black men -- in the years after the Civil War. Jim Crow sought specifically to roll back black Americans' legal gains and strengthen and sustain all that contributed to black social subjugation.\nAgain, consider the essence of Lynch's speech:\n... Last week, our Civil Rights Division notified state officials that House Bill 2 violates federal civil rights laws.? We asked that they certify by the end of the day today that they would not comply with or implement House Bill 2â€™s restriction on restroom access. An extension was requested by North Carolina and was under active consideration. But instead of replying to our offer or providing a certification, this morning, the state of North Carolina and its governor chose to respond by suing the Department of Justice.? As a result of their decisions, we are now moving forward.\nToday, we are filing a federal civil rights lawsuit against the state of North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety and the University of North Carolina. We are seeking a court order declaring House Bill 2â€™s restroom restriction impermissibly discriminatory, as well as a statewide bar on its enforcement.? While the lawsuit currently seeks declaratory relief, I want to note that we retain the option of curtailing federal funding to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety and the University of North Carolina as this case proceeds.\nThis action is about a great deal more than just bathrooms. This is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we, as a people and as a country, have enacted to protect them ? indeed, to protect all of us.? And itâ€™s about the founding ideals that have led this country ? haltingly but inexorably ? in the direction of fairness, inclusion and equality for all Americans.\nThis is not the first time that we have seen discriminatory responses to historic moments of progress for our nation.? We saw it in the Jim Crow laws that followed the Emancipation Proclamation.? We saw it in fierce and widespread resistance to Brown v. Board of Education. And we saw it in the proliferation of state bans on same-sex unions intended to stifle any hope that gay and lesbian Americans might one day be afforded the right to marry. ...\nThat accurate read of U.S. history makes very clear the damage -- political, social and legal -- that can result from claims that transgender people represent a wholesale threat to the safety of women and children in public facilities (as was claimed in Houston) or useful cover for pedophiles (the North Carolina argument).\nPeople have a right to differ on bathroom laws. But they should always attempt do so with intellectual honesty and an accurate read on not-so-distant U.S. history. And whatever those who support North Carolina's position in this matter do, there's little value in dispatching Ben Carson to defend your cause.\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	World

With the 2016 Summer Games in Rio just three months away, President Dilma Rousseff lit the Olympic torch here last week and smiled for television cameras. It was probably her last Olympic ceremony as president.\nAs soon as Wednesday, Brazilian senators are expected to vote to open impeachment proceedings against her. Rousseff would be suspended from office, setting the stage for her permanent removal.\nBut while Rousseffâ€™s opponents seem to grow giddier with each step toward that outcome, many Brazilians say it will bring them neither pleasure nor relief from the problems the country faces amid its worst economic crisis in 80?years.\nRather than a solution to Brazilâ€™s woes, Rousseffâ€™s impeachment looks more and more like a symptom of them, and maybe the beginning of a long detour into political dysfunction. Her exit, for many, would mark a new low point for a country viewed as an ascendant global power just a few years ago.\nâ€œThereâ€™s a sense of sadness about this whole process,â€? said Paulo Sotero, the director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.\nâ€œOur democracy is not going to unravel,â€? he said. â€œBut we are headed for a rough period, and we may be at it for five to ten years.â€?\n[ The rise and fall of the â€˜Brazilian modelâ€™ ]\nRousseffâ€™s impeachment process has taken on an aura of inevitability in recent weeks. She is increasingly isolated politically. Her alarm-ringing characterization of the campaign against her as a politically motivated, misogynistic â€œcoupâ€? has failed to generate much sympathy outside of her base of left-wing supporters.\nBut the proceedings against Rousseff also have a credibility problem, with many Brazilians wondering whether her removal is being pursued because she committed a crime or simply because she is unpopular.\nIf she is impeached, there is no strong, unifying leader coming to Brazilâ€™s rescue. This realization is sinking in. Nearly every major politician in the country is under a cloud of suspicion from the sprawling â€œCar Washâ€? probe of bribes and kickbacks at the state oil company Petrobras.\nThe sense of gloom deepened for some last month when Brazilâ€™s lower house voted overwhelmingly to put Rousseff on trial after a televised, marathon session that took on a circus-like atmosphere , with deputies taunting, shoving and even spitting at each other.\nâ€œThat was a real show of horrors,â€? said Lucas Lisboa, 26, an online marketing director in Brasilia who opposes impeachment and said last monthâ€™s vote led some of his anti-Rousseff friends to change their minds about wanting her kicked out.\nThat vote was orchestrated by Rousseffâ€™s archenemy, lower house Speaker Eduardo Cunha , who is under investigation himself for allegedly brokering as much as $40?million in bribes. On Thursday, the Supreme Court ordered him to step down because of the seriousness of the corruption allegations and the risk that he could use his post to interfere with that probe.\nHe has appealed the decision, but the courtâ€™s order further erodes the credibility of his push to sack Rousseff.\nShe faces impeachment for separate charges: that she spent money without congressional approval and improperly borrowed funds from banks for popular social programs. Senators must decide whether this amounts to what is considered a â€œcrime of responsibility.â€?\nRousseff insists that she did nothing wrong and that the financial tactics have been a standard practice of Brazilian presidents.\nIn an interview, former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso , who led Brazil from 1995 to 2003, acknowledged that he, too, moved money around while in office, but said â€œitâ€™s not the same.â€?\nâ€œThese were momentary uses of resources from banks,â€? said Cardoso, who backs Rousseffâ€™s impeachment. â€œThey were small reserves. It was a matter of cash flow, and quickly corrected.â€?\nWith Rousseff, he said, â€œwe are talking about tens of billions of dollars over a long period of time. A continuous manipulation of fiscal data.â€?\nThe presidentâ€™s critics say she used accounting tricks to deceive Brazilian lawmakers and the public about her spending.\nâ€œThere were very bad choices,â€? said Sotero, the Wilson Center scholar.\nRousseffâ€™s fate will be determined as soon as Wednesday afternoon. If at least 41 of Brazilâ€™s 81 senators opt to put her on trial, she will be compelled to temporarily step down. Senators would have 180 days to conduct hearings ahead of a final vote, with a two-thirds majority required to unseat her permanently.\nRousseff insists that she will not go down without a fight , but even her supporters concede that a rancorous impeachment trial would be likely to cause irreparable damage to her presidency.\nThe presidentâ€™s opponents argue that her removal is the key to putting Brazil back on track. Latin Americaâ€™s largest economy is headed for a 3.8?percent GDP contraction for the second year in a row, and 3?million Brazilians have lost their jobs since January 2015.\nThe crash, the corruption scandals and Rousseffâ€™s brusque, abrasive leadership style have left her with an approval rating that barely rises into double digits.\nStill, that has not translated to widespread enthusiasm for impeachment, which would give Vice President Michel Temer, Rousseffâ€™s rival, the presidency. According to polls, he is just as disliked as Rousseff.\nAn electoral court recently ordered Temer to pay a fine for violating campaign-finance laws, a development that could potentially bar him from running for office for eight years. Temer, 75, has said he would finish out Rousseffâ€™s term but would not be a candidate for president in 2018.\n[ Brazilians ask: Does their vice president want the top job a bit too much? ]\nIn a survey of more than 2,000 Brazilians in 142 cities last month by pollster Ibope, only 25?percent said they wanted to see Rousseff remain in office. But just 8?percent said they supported her impeachment if it meant Temer would take her place.\nAna de Sousa, 56, a retired manicurist living near Rioâ€™s City of God slum, said Rousseffâ€™s impeachment â€œwouldnâ€™t improve things.â€?\nâ€œI donâ€™t think the people who will take over are going to be any better,â€? de Sousa said. â€œThey will come in and steal even more.â€?\nA majority of Brazilians say they would prefer new elections, but it seems unlikely that Brazilâ€™s Congress would pass a constitutional amendment authorizing them.\nTemer remains at risk of impeachment for alleged corruption. But this past week, Brazilâ€™s top prosecutor did not include Temer in a new list of names he wants the Supreme Court to investigate in the Petrobras scandal ? including government ministers and former president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva. The prosecutor is also seeking to investigate Rousseff and Lula for possibly obstructing the Petrobras investigation.\n[ Corruption scandals are roiling Latin America ]\nAlthough Temer is not a popular choice to replace Rousseff, he is the only other leader who can claim a democratic mandate, said JosÃ© ?lvaro MoisÃ©s, a political scientist at the University of S?o Paulo. Temer was Rousseffâ€™s running mate in 2014, with the ballot getting 54?million votes.\nâ€œHe has all the legitimacy he needs to be interim president,â€? MoisÃ©s said.\nTemerâ€™s honeymoon would be short.

Carlin, Gregory J. Love and Cecilia MartÃnez-Gallardo May 5\nDemonstrators during an April 17 protest in Sao Paulo, Brazil, look toward?a big screen showing a session to review the request for the impeachment of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. (Rodrigo Paiva/Reuters)\nRonald Reagan was famously called â€œthe Teflon presidentâ€? for his ability to deflect scandals that might have sunk his popularity. So why couldnâ€™t Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff tap into this same protection?\nFollowing the lower houseâ€™s overwhelming vote on April 17 to impeach Rousseff, Brazilâ€™s government sits on the brink of collapse. An onslaught of corruption charges against the president and her Workers Party (PT) has emboldened her political opponents. In response to allegations of an elaborate kickback scheme that funneled bribes to politicians via the state-run oil firm, Petrobras, Brazilâ€™s elites ? including the governmentâ€™s largest coalition partner, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) ? and the public have abandoned Rousseffâ€™s government. Her approval stands at a historically low 9 to 10 percent .\n[ Brazilâ€™s lower house of Congress votes to impeach President Dilma Rousseff ]\nMedia coverage of these scandals has been scathing and unrelenting. Yet high-level corruption is hardly new in Brazil. In fact, Rousseffâ€™s predecessor and mentor, Luiz InÃ¡cio â€œLulaâ€? da Silva, also from the PT, was himself at the center of several scandals. In 2005, the expansive mensal?o investigation of PT payoffs for legislative support threatened to derail his bid for reelection. And yet Lula proved to be a Teflon president and cruised to an easy victory in 2006 ? and then helped his chosen successor win the presidency in 2010.\nWithout a doubt, the scope of the Rousseff investigation is larger than anything Brazilians have seen before. But the actual charges are strongly reminiscent of the 2005 scandal Lula weathered easily: In both cases, the scandal reached high-level politicians in the PT and its allied parties without directly implicating the president. Both scandals essentially involved the diversion of public funds to buy political favors.\nYet this time around, public reaction to the news President Rousseff was allegedly involved in a scandal has been substantially more negative. Why have scandals provoked starkly different political outcomes for Rousseff and Lula?\nWhat changed? Itâ€™s the economy.\nOur research shows that in Brazil, as in most of Latin America, the publicâ€™s desire to hold their leaders accountable is highly contingent on the state of the economy.\nA decade ago, full of optimism about the countryâ€™s economic prospects, most Brazilians were willing to brush aside the accusations against Lulaâ€™s government and grant him a second term. Today, however, with Brazilâ€™s economic output in decline , commodity prices collapsing and inflation reaching double digits, Brazilians have shown substantially less tolerance. Instead they protested against government corruption, pressuring their representatives to impeach the president.\nIn a recent study examining how scandals shape presidential public approval, we find that the linkages between scandals and economic performance extend far beyond Brazil. In fact, looking at data from 84 presidential regimes across Latin America, we find that presidential approval ratings are very sensitive to charges of corruption, but only if the country is experiencing high inflation, high unemployment, or both.\nOur work shows that as inflation and unemployment increase, scandals matter more ? they have a far more negative effect on presidential approval ratings. Despite wide media coverage of the embezzlement, bribes and malfeasances of presidents and their associates, our research shows that a strong economy effectively shields leaders from political damage.\nA weak economy makes presidents vulnerable\nA weak economy not only makes presidents more vulnerable to scandals, it also provides an ideal environment for opponents to strike. Political scientist AnÃbal Perez-Li?Ã¡n describes the feeding frenzy that often results when scandals start to take a toll on a leaderâ€™s popularity. Essentially, scandals beget scandals; journalists are likely to dig up more dirt or investigate allegations they might previously have ignored.\nAs the figure below suggests for the case of Brazil, this scenario is most likely to unfold when presidents are seen as vulnerable and their approval ratings are on the skids ? exactly what happens with a weak economy. As the figure below shows, Rousseffâ€™s approval ratings were closely tied to Brazilâ€™s declining economic outlook .\nPresidential approval (in blue, on left y-axis) and a composite index of leading economic indicators (in red, on right y-axis), with the 2014 Petrobras scandal and later protests marked as vertical lines.\nThe Petrobras scandal, along with massive anti-corruption rallies that rocked the president and her party over the past two years, emerged only after steep declines in the countryâ€™s economic outlook. Rousseffâ€™s reelection campaign in 2014 provided a brief respite in which her approval and the economic outlook ticked up. But this recovery was cut short by the media digging back into political scandals. As Brazilâ€™s economy continued to soften, the presidentâ€™s approval ratings fell off into the single digits.\nWhat does this all mean for the durability and quality of democracy in new and developing countries? Well, the economic crisis and corruption scandals are pushing Brazilians to demand a more accountable and representative government. Thatâ€™s the optimistic view ? and perhaps thatâ€™s where democracy is headed in Brazil. For pessimists, however, the events in Brazil showcase a troubling trend of conditional accountability that does not bode well for democracy. The public is willing to forgive or ignore graft and corruption in good economic times and is only prepared to mobilize against corruption when the economy tanks.\nRyan E.

Here's a brief guide to what's next.	2016-05-12 00:00:00	Brazilâ€™s president is facing impeachment. Hereâ€™s a brief guide to whatâ€™s next.\nThe inside track on Washington politics.\nBe the first to know about new stories from PowerPost.

(Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters)\nBrazil, one of the worldâ€™s largest democracies, is mired in a deep political crisis. The countryâ€™s economy is tanking, the scary Zika epidemic continues, and the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio is less than three months away.\nWith Brazilâ€™s leaders enmeshed in power struggles and corruption scandals, the country of 200 million, Latin Americaâ€™s largest, appears increasingly adrift.\nNow comes a major test of?where Brazil is headed. On?Wednesday, Brazilian senators will likely vote to?impeach?President Dilma Rousseff, suspending her from office.\nWith new corruption allegations and indictments surfacing every week, it can be tough to keep track of whatâ€™s happening and whatâ€™s next.\nHereâ€™s a quick guide through Brazilâ€™s political wreckage, in the form of questions and answers about whatâ€™s going on.\nSo Brazil is likely?to impeach President Dilma Rousseff on Wednesday?\nSenators will vote on a measure already approved by the?lower house to put Rousseff on trial, and it doesn't look good for Brazil's?president. If a simple majority of 81 senators agree, Rousseff will be suspended and Vice President Michel Temer will be sworn in.\nThen what?\nThe Senate would be turned into a kind of special tribunal to hear arguments and consider evidence for and against Rousseff. Lawmakers would have 180 days to conduct the hearings ahead of a final vote, and a two-thirds majority would be needed to permanently remove the president. Temer would serve out the rest of her term through 2018.\nRousseff says sheâ€™ll fight the whole way, but the proceedings are likely to be a bruising ordeal. The Olympics start Aug. 5, so itâ€™s possible Brazilian TV viewers will be flipping channels between track events, swimming races and Rousseffâ€™s impeachment battle.\nThereâ€™s been some speculation that lawmakers would try to fast-track her impeachment for this very reason,?to avoid the damage to Brazilâ€™s international image while global attention is on the Games. But Rousseff, her attorneys and her supporters in the Senate are unlikely to oblige.\nSo Rousseff is accused of corruption?\nNot exactly. Rousseff is accused of using billions' worth of unauthorized loans from government banks, in part to fund social welfare programs that benefit the poor Brazilians who are a key constituency of her leftist Workersâ€™ Party. While this bookkeeping tactic is not especially new among Brazilian presidents, Central Bank figures suggest that it increased significantly over the past several years as the countryâ€™s economy deteriorated .\nRousseff denies wrongdoing, but it will be up to senators to decide whether?her actions constitute an impeachable offense, or what Brazilian law considers a â€œcrime of responsibility.â€?\nBrazilâ€™s top prosecutor also asked the Supreme Court to investigate Rousseff for allegedly interfering with the massive â€œCar Washâ€? corruption scandal at state oil company Petrobras. Rousseff is not one of the dozens of lawmakers under indictment or suspicion of stealing money from Petrobras, but she was the chair of its board of directors when many of her political allies were skimming and taking bribes.\nWhat happens if Rousseff beats the charges?\nRousseff would resume her presidential term, but political analysts say she would be so weakened by the impeachment process that itâ€™s nearly impossible to imagine her being able to recover. Brazilâ€™s system has dozens of political parties, and nothing can get done without coalition-building and deal-cutting. Her enemies are many, and her public-approval rating hovers around 10 percent, according to recent polls.\nCanâ€™t they just call new elections?\nSurveys indicate thatâ€™s what most Brazilians would prefer. But such a scenario is not contemplated by Brazilian law. So lawmakers would have to pass a constitutional amendment, and they donâ€™t seem to be in any mood to help Rousseff save face with a graceful exit.\nWho takes over if Rousseffâ€™s out?\nVice President Michel Temer, Rousseffâ€™s former running mate-turned-rival. Temer, 75, has a reputation as a skilled negotiator and dealmaker, but heâ€™s viewed just as negatively by the public as Rousseff. Heâ€™s also battled corruption allegations, and he was president of the centrist PMDB party, Brazilâ€™s largest, when prosecutors say it was deeply involved in the graft scheme at Petrobras.\nWhat about former president Lula? Is he still Brazilâ€™s most popular politician??\nLuiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, who led Brazil during its economic boom ?and left office with an 87 percent approval rating in 2010, has fallen, and hard. Heâ€™s very much at the center of the storm. Heâ€™s still a beloved figure to many Brazilians, especially the poor, but heâ€™s potentially facing a range of charges for corruption and obstruction of justice. He would be eligible to run for president again in 2018 ? if heâ€™s not in jail ? and has all but said he plans to do so. He's also said he?is innocent of the allegations.\nHow will all of this affect the Summer Olympics in Rio?\nItâ€™s a big unknown. Organizers of the Games say Brazil will be ready, put on its best face and set its conflicts aside. But the economic crisis and the political tensions have left Brazilians angry and divided. They may be in no mood to have a party. Then again, itâ€™s Brazil, and the countryâ€™s famous Carnival tradition is all about forgetting your problems and?having a little fun.\nworld\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	World

(Fernando Bizerra Jr./EPA)\nBy Lisandra Paraguassu and Silvio Cascione May 5\nBRASILIA ? A Supreme Court justice suspended the speaker of Brazilâ€™s lower house of Congress on Thursday for obstructing a corruption investigation, removing him from the line of succession to the president just days before she too is expected to be suspended.\nA court spokeswoman said Eduardo Cunha, a bitter rival of President Dilma Rousseff and the legislator responsible for impeachment proceedings against her, had been removed as speaker pending confirmation by the full court.\nThe move, yet another political tremor in a country struggling with a historic government crisis and the worst recession in decades, followed a request from Brazilâ€™s top prosecutor.\nAs speaker, Cunha was third in line for the presidency and would have become second if Rousseff, as expected, was suspended from office next week because of alleged budget irregularities. She would be replaced by Michel Temer, the 75-year-old vice president.\nSupreme Court Justice Teori Zavascki accepted an injunction requested five months ago by the prosecutor general. The prosecutor sought Cunhaâ€™s removal for allegedly intimidating lawmakers and obstructing an investigation into accusations that he held undeclared bank accounts in Switzerland.\nBrazil is increasingly polarized and entirely consumed with its political crisis. By no means is the country on the verge of collapse, but here are some reasons why the turmoil isnâ€™t so good for the rest of us. (Nick Miroff,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\nCunha is the only sitting lawmaker officially charged by the Supreme Court with corruption in a sweeping kickbacks scandal focused on state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, commonly known as Petrobras. An evangelical Christian with strong support from the religious right in Congress, Cunha has for months been fending off ethics committee hearings in the lower house about whether he lied about the Swiss accounts.\nDeputy speaker Waldir Maranhao, a member of the Progressive Party who is also being investigated in the Petrobras scandal, became acting head of the lower chamber after Cunhaâ€™s suspension.\nCunha launched impeachment proceedings against Rousseff in December on charges she broke budget laws. As an implacable foe of the president, his suspension could have helped Rousseff had it come earlier. Now it could work against her by weakening her argument that she is being impeached by corrupt politicians. It could, in contrast, help a Temer presidency by removing the taint of suspicion from a key position with whom the new president would have to negotiate for legislative traction.\nâ€œTemer would inherit the presidency because of a process started by Cunha,â€? said Rafael Cortez, a political analyst with Tendencias, a consultancy in Sao Paulo. â€œAny agreements they would have made could have looked like payback for enabling him to become president.â€?\nMost crucial for Temer is the need to pass much-needed reforms to kick-start the economy, plug a gaping budget deficit and restore confidence for Brazilâ€™s struggling consumers, businesses and industry.\nThe leftist president is fighting for her political survival since the lower house commanded by Cunha voted April 17 to charge her with manipulating government accounts, which her opponents say allowed her to boost public spending before her 2014 reelection.\nRousseff denies any wrongdoing.\n	washingtonpost	World

Thousands of Brazilians marched in cities across the country as part of a national day of protest against the government. (Antonio Lacerda/European Pressphoto Agency)\n?\n?\nIn April, Brazilâ€™s Chamber of Deputies voted to impeach President Dilma Rousseff (Workersâ€™ Party, PT) halfway through her second term, by a final tally of 367 to 137. Thereâ€™s more to this story than the final tally.\n[ Brazilâ€™s lower house of Congress votes to impeach President Dilma Rousseff ]\nRousseffâ€™s main coalition partner, the PMDB, orchestrated and provided the bulk of the impeachment vote. But it was the defection of smaller parties that ultimately brought about her defeat. Three key parties accounted for 93 â€œyesâ€? votes ??while the â€œnoâ€? votes fell 26 shy of stopping the impeachment. These parties, generally hungry for resources, turned on the president despite being offered greater influence in the Cabinet in the days before the vote.\nThe impeachment vote breakdown, by state\nHereâ€™s where state politics get really interesting. Defector party votes varied significantly across state delegations. The â€œyesâ€? vote carried in 22 of 27 states . Of the five states that voted against impeachment, four are governed by the PT, and the other by a leftist ally. In two PT-governed states ( Bahia and CearÃ¡ ), representatives from defector parties defied national party leaders and voted to keep the president. But in another ( Minas Gerais ) they voted heavily to impeach her.\nWendy Hunter , at the University of Texas at Austin, and I found that the PT leveraged the presidency to gain a critical foothold at the state and local levels in the less-developed Brazilian Northeast (where many of these states are located). Despite its control over federal resources, the PT could not breach local strongholds alone. Rather, it pragmatically made alliances with parties from the center and right that provided local voters ??and in return expected government assistance, such as patronage appointments and discretionary resources available through federal ministries.\n[ A handy guide to Brazilâ€™s impeachment process and politics. ]\nThe vote breakdown reflects these local bases of political support. The state delegations that voted with the president stayed loyal at the behest of their governors and because these smaller parties had significantly more to lose than federal pork, i.e., privileged positions in state governments. Where these parties were not part of the state coalition (Minas Gerais), the governor could not effectively steer their votes.\nState-level support is critical to todayâ€™s PT. Although it became famous for taking a different political approach , the party became increasingly normalized on its way to the presidency, making use of marketing-driven campaigns and embracing pragmatic coalitional politics. One such departure was picking Michel Temer as Rousseffâ€™s running mate and ceding prominent Cabinet posts to the PMDB ??the type of party they historically eschewed. But the PMDB, a loose confederation of local elites, proved a reliably unreliable partner. The PT government then hedged its bets by giving away a larger share of the Cabinet and the bureaucracy to smaller parties and openly steering PMDB and opposition politicians to join these parties.\nLetâ€™s look more closely at the charges\nJurists tied to the opposition accused Rousseff of using a series of accounting tricks, such as delaying payments to state-owned banks , to shield the size of the government deficit. This allowed the president to boost spending in key states in an election year.\nDuring the actual impeachment vote , however, few representatives mentioned the formal charges. â€œYesâ€? voters made impassionate references to family, God, country, home constituencies and interest groups. â€œNoâ€? voters touted the PTâ€™s social and economic record before shouting, â€œNo to the coup!â€?\nIn practice, the impeachment vote was a political trial of a highly unpopular president . Six years ago, the PT had unparalleled popularity resulting from economic growth, stability and policy innovations that significantly cut into Brazilâ€™s high levels of socioeconomic inequality. Since then, Brazil has experienced a historic economic downturn as the global commodity boom collapsed. A corruption scandal crippled the state oil giant, Petrobras , the political appointees who controlled it and its private contractors.\n[ Police detained Brazilâ€™s ex-president. Hereâ€™s what you need to know. ]\nRousseff isnâ€™t the only politician caught up in accusations\nQuite a few of Brazilâ€™s entrenched political elites face serious ethical charges. The heads of both chambers of congress are involved in corruption investigations , and 60 percent of sitting lawmakers face legal challenges . Although high-ranking members of her party have been implicated in corruption investigations, the president actually has not. Yet, the scandals under her watch probably led to the upheaval in popular opinion against her.\nThese corruption charges, in turn, tie back into subnational interests in Brazilâ€™s multiparty presidential system. Spanish political scientist Juan Linz argued that presidential systems are crisis-prone because they increase the stakes of political competition while guaranteeing fixed terms to independently elected executives and lawmakers. We can see Linzâ€™s â€œdual democratic legitimaciesâ€? at work here. On one side, lawmakers respond to pressures from local elites and voters to chastise a president for propping up the economy in an election year by fudging government accounts. At the same time, the president touts her national electoral majority (54 million votes) to discredit her accusers and judges.\nBrazilâ€™s highly fractionalized multiparty system also helped corrupt practices flourish. Under these conditions, presidents have to portion out the Cabinet and the thousands of appointed positions they control in the bureaucracy in order to build legislative majorities. This â€œ coalitional presidentialism â€? has been successful in Brazil and elsewhere, but the system is vulnerable to economic changes or shifts in public opinion.\nMany of the parties that bulk up governing coalitions in Brazil are interested only in latching on to state resources. These parties, which the PT increasingly relied on, were also the least attached to its success. As opposition and pragmatic parties stepped up their attack, many (although, as we have seen, not in their entirety) easily realigned back to the right.\nWhatâ€™s ahead for Rousseff and the PT ??and politics in Brazil in general? Brazil has made a considerable effort to clean up corruption in recent decades. Transparency legislation requires timely disclosure of the minutiae of public spending. Oversight bodies have increased capacity and mandates. And political parties are blocked from usurping new social policies for political gain.\nAn earlier post in the Monkey Cage argues that what is happening in Brazil is part of a regional resurgence of the political right across Latin America . Whether the right will displace the PT is difficult to predict. If it does, it probably will depend as much on politics in the states as on what happens in BrasÃlia.\nJorge Antonio Alves is assistant professor of political science at Queens College at CUNY.\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	World

Straining to mend their party after months of chaos, Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan declared themselves â€œtotally committedâ€? to working together after a fence-mending personal meeting on Thursday. Ryan praised Trump as â€œvery warm and genuine,â€? and suggested that after initial hesitance he may well end up endorsing the GOP candidate for president.\nâ€œWe will have policy disputes. There is no two ways about that. The question is, can we unify on the common core principles that make our party?â€? Ryan said. â€œAnd Iâ€™m very encouraged that the answer to that question is yes.â€?\nTrump, who used the day to launch a robust charm offensive with members of Congress, broadcast his own enthusiasm, on Twitter and on TV. â€œI really think we had a great meeting today, and I think we agree on a lot of things and itâ€™ll be a little process but itâ€™ll come along . Iâ€™m pretty sure,â€? he said in an interview recorded for Fox News Channelâ€™s â€œHannity.â€?\nThe surprisingly fervent show of unity capped a remarkable week that began with Ryan, the GOPâ€™s top elected office-holder and its 2012 vice presidential nominee, turning his back on his partyâ€™s presumptive presidential nominee just days after Trump had effectively clinched the nomination.\nRyan said at the time he was not yet ready to back Trump, who had succeeded in insulting women, Latinos, disabled people and many conservatives in the course of a brutal primary season. He also has alarmed the Republican establishment with proposals including deporting millions of immigrants and barring Muslims from the country.\n___\nBrazilâ€™s acting president promises to jumpstart economy\nBRASILIA, Brazil ? Picking up Brazilâ€™s reins after the Senate voted to suspend President Dilma Rousseff, acting President Michel Temer pledged Thursday to jumpstart the stalled economy and push ahead with a sprawling corruption investigation that has already ensnared top leaders of his own party and even implicated Temer himself.\nTemer spoke in the same narrow hall where a defiant Rousseff made what may prove her last remarks as president earlier in the day. He reached out a timid olive branch to his two-time running mate, saying he wanted his appearance to be â€œsoberâ€? in recognition of his â€œinstitutional respectâ€? for Rousseff and of the deep divisions caused by the impeachment campaign against her.\nâ€œThis is not a moment for celebrations, but one of profound reflection,â€? Temer said at a chaotic swearing-in ceremony for the 22 members of his new Cabinet. â€œItâ€™s urgent to pacify the nation and unify the country. Itâ€™s urgent for us to form a government of national salvation . to pull this country out of the serious crisis in which we find ourselves.â€?\nThe Senate voted 55-22 to impeach Rousseff over allegations her government broke fiscal laws in managing the federal budget. Rousseff insisted the accusations are baseless, since such financial maneuvers have been common practice by other Brazilian presidents without repercussions.\nShe was immediately suspended for 180 days pending a trial in the Senate. If she is found by two-thirds of the Senate to have committed crimes, Temer will serve out the remainder of her term, which ends in December 2018.\n___\n10 Things to Know for Friday\nYour daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Friday:\n1. WHO MET IN DC\nDonald Trump and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan declared they are â€œtotally committedâ€? to working together to win in November.\n2. WHERE A PRESIDENT VOWS TO FIGHT HER OUSTER\nBrazilâ€™s Dilma Rousseff vows to use â€œall legal meansâ€? to continue opposing her impeachment, raising the specter of continued political turmoil.\n___\nAfter political turmoil, Olympic organizers push on\nRIO DE JANEIRO ? The venues are, in the words of organizers, 99 percent ready. The torch is winding its way around the country in a three-month relay ending at the opening ceremony.\nEven if the country is preoccupied with the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, organizers insist the Olympics wonâ€™t be touched by the ongoing political turmoil.\nWill that bear out? Stay tuned.\nâ€œThe organization of the games is absolutely following the right path,â€? Carlos Nuzman, head of the organizing committee, said Thursday. â€œAnd it will continue the same way.â€?\nWill a change in the countryâ€™s chief executive cause more problems as the calendar ticks down to Rio? What about the effect of the countryâ€™s rotating sports leadership?\n___\n2nd website posts auction for gun that killed Trayvon Martin\nMIAMI ? An online gun auction website yanked George Zimmermanâ€™s ad to sell the pistol he used to kill unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, saying it wanted no part in the deal, but a second site offered to post it.\nA listing for the weapon was removed from the GunBroker.com site Thursday morning, minutes after the auction was to begin, as negative traffic about the sale exploded online. In a statement posted on its website, GunBroker.com said listings are user generated, and that the company reserved the right to reject listings at its discretion.\nZimmerman never contacted anyone at the site and no one there â€œhas any relationship with Zimmerman,â€? the company wrote in its statement.\nIt added, â€œWe want no part in the listing on our web site or in any of the publicity it is receiving.â€?\nHours later, United Gun Group tweeted that it would post Zimmermanâ€™s ad. The new link was posted, along with a statement from Zimmerman. However, the site apparently went down a few minutes later. The site calls itself a â€œsocial market place for the firearms community.â€?\n___\nWith Hiroshima, Obama goes where predecessors stayed away\nWASHINGTON ? When President Barack Obama tours Hiroshimaâ€™s haunting relics of nuclear warfare, he will be making a trip that past administrations weighed and avoided. For good reason: The hollowed core of the cityâ€™s A-Bomb Dome and old photos of charred children are sure to rekindle questions of guilt and penitence for World War IIâ€™s gruesome brutality.\nObamaâ€™s visit later this month already is stirring debate on both sides of the Pacific about the motivations and justifications for the nuclear attacks in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Anything he says will be sharply scrutinized in the U.S., Japan and beyond. Anything resembling an apology could become a wedge issue in the U.S. presidential campaign and plunge Obama into the complicated politics of victimhood among Japan and its Asian neighbors.\nâ€œI donâ€™t have any problem with him going, but there is nothing to apologize for,â€? said Lester Tenney, a 95-year-old American survivor of the 1942 Bataan Death March, when the Japanese marched tens of thousands of Filipino and U.S. soldiers to prison camps, and hundreds to their deaths.\nForty-two years ago, a White House aide suggested President Gerald Ford visit the city where 140,000 people were killed in the inferno on Aug. 6, 1945. A senior adviser, Gen. Brent Scowcroft, vetoed the idea: â€œIt could rekindle old animosities in Japan at a time when we are striving for new relationships.â€?\nAsked in 2008 if he might go, President George W. Bush was noncommittal. In the end, it took 65 years for a U.S. ambassador to attend the cityâ€™s annual memorial service. Secretary of State John Kerry traveled there last month.\n___\nSecret Service to investigate Trumpâ€™s former butler\nWASHINGTON ? Donald Trumpâ€™s former butler has drawn the attention of Secret Service for threats online heâ€™s made against President Barack Obama.\nAnthony Senecal, who served the presumptive Republican nominee at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, has a Facebook page filled with incendiary comments. Many of the posts are directed at the president and his family. The posts were first reported by Mother Jones.\nIn one message from September 2015, Senecal said the military should hang Obama for treason and other â€œhigh crimes.â€? In another that month, he described Obama, a Christian, by using a slur for a member of the Muslim faith.

Kansas is pursuing regulations that would give it one of the nationâ€™s toughest policies against allowing transgender people to update their birth certificates, prompting anger from advocates and threats of a lawsuit.\nState health department officials contend an existing agency regulation allowing amended birth certificates conflicts with state law and needs to be eliminated. The agency has been pursuing changes for months and could impose them within six weeks.\nThe departmentâ€™s revised rules would allow a change only if a person or his or her parents could document that the gender was incorrectly recorded at the time of birth.\nThree transgender rights advocates called on the department to abandon its proposed changes during a hearing Thursday. The National Center for Transgender Equality says only Idaho and Tennessee have legal policies against changing gender listings on birth certificates, though Ohio also is not allowing it.\nâ€œIt really stands against where most of the
 country is on updating identity documents to accurately reflect who people are,â€? said Arli Christian, the centerâ€™s state policy counsel.\n___\nFacebook delivers the scoop on how it delivers the news\nNEW YORK ? Will â€œTrending topicsâ€? become a â€œtrendingâ€? topic on Facebook?\nThe social media giant on Thursday pulled back the curtain on how its Trending Topics feature works, a reaction to a report in the tech blog Gizmodo that claimed Facebook downplays conservative news subjects. Facebook denies that report, which relied upon a single anonymous individual with self-described conservative leanings.\nIn its own blog post , the company said a series of checks and balances ? involving both software formulas and humans ? ensures that stories displayed in the â€œtrending topicsâ€? section arenâ€™t biased. The post linked to a 28-page internal document Facebook uses to determine trending topics, after the Guardian published a similar document that was leaked to it.\nJustin Osofsky, vice president of global operations, said the guidelines ensure that stories in trending topics represent â€œthe most important popular stories, regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum.â€?\nâ€œThe guidelines do not permit reviewers to add or suppress political perspectives,â€? he said in a statement.\n___\nRussia, Kenya track teams may miss Rio after doping rulings\nMONTREAL ? Together, Russia and Kenya won 27 medals at the last Olympics in track and field. Their total at the next one could be zero.\nThe Olympic hopes of the powerhouse teams from both countries took serious blows Thursday after the World Anti-Doping Agency delivered stinging rebukes to attempts to clean up their drug-addled programs.\nThe WADA foundation board suspended Kenyaâ€™s anti-doping agency after determining a new law passed there to combat doping was â€œa complete mess.â€? The agency also released new numbers out of Russia showing that testing by independent authorities has decreased by more than two-thirds in the past year.\nâ€œDisappointing and disturbing information,â€? said Beckie Scott, the Canadian gold-medal cross country skier who chairs WADAâ€™s athlete committee.\nAt the London Olympics, Russia won 16 medals and Kenya won 11.

(European Pressphoto Agency)\nBRASILIA ? The man who assumed control of Latin Americaâ€™s largest country, Vice President Michel Temer, is a career politician with a reputation as a skilled negotiator and smooth behind-the-scenes operator.\nHis supporters say he's just the?kind of experienced statesman the country needs in its moment of crisis -- with?President Dilma Rousseff suspended from office Thursday by the senate and facing trial over alleged fiscal wrongdoing.\nBut, this being Brazil, that doesnâ€™t mean Temer is a stodgy technocrat taking the helm.\nA legal?scholar and sometime poet, Temer, 75, is famous for his dapper?suits, slicked-back silver hair and wife -- who will turn 33 on Monday -- who was only a toddler when Brazilian democracy returned in 1985 after two decades of military rule.\nHe?is the author of " Anonymous Intimacy ," a book of sensual verses inspired by his wife, Marcela, who was a 20-year-old aspiring beauty queen when she became Temer's?third wife in 2003.\nTemer has assumed?Brazilâ€™s presidency on an interim basis, but given the overwhelming margin by which Rousseff lost Thursday's vote, there appears to be a growing likelihood he will serve out the rest of her term through 2018.\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff bowed out defiantly following the Senate's vote to suspend her rule in order to put her on trial for allegedly breaking budget laws. (Reuters)\n[Rousseff suspended from presidency, will face trial]\nThe son of Christian Lebanese immigrants, Temer has signaled he will take Brazil and its ailing economy in a more free-market direction. His popularity ratings have registered even lower than Rousseffâ€™s in recent polls, and though he, too, has been named in Brazil's corruption investigations, those?who know him well say he has the political skills to quickly win over a skeptical public.\nâ€œI have never since [seen] someone as prepared for this emotionally as Michel Temer,â€? said Jacob Goldberg, one of Brazilâ€™s most celebrated psychoanalysts, whose clients have included many politicians, artists, and star athletes.?He called Temer â€œa cordial man, a man of dialogueâ€? and â€œnot a man of confrontation.â€?\nâ€œHe is someone prepared for crisis. He is a man prepared for stress,â€? said Goldberg in an interview.\nâ€œAs a psychoanalyst, I have seen very few people as prepared as he is,â€? he said, though he declined to confirm whether Temer has been his patient, citing confidentiality. But they have known each other for decades and maintain a close relationship.\nAdded Goldberg: â€œBrazil will discover a very charismatic politician.â€?\nThis has not always been Temer's reputation. He is sometimes mocked as "The Butler" because he is said to resemble a character in a campy horror movie and is the kind of restrained?figure?who seems to know much but say?little in public.\nAnalysts say he will have to quickly overcome public distrust and doubts about his path to?the presidency.

In his first words to Brazilians as acting president, the former vice president promised to beef up the fight against corruption, and in particular said he will support the sweeping investigation into a mammoth kickback scheme at state oil company Petrobras. Temer himself has been implicated by witnesses in the probe, though he has not been charged. (Eraldo Peres/Associated Press)\nBy Jenny Barchfield and Mauricio Savarese | AP May 12 at 7:27 PM\nBRASILIA, Brazil ? Picking up Brazilâ€™s reins after the Senate voted to suspend President Dilma Rousseff, acting President Michel Temer pledged Thursday to jumpstart the stalled economy and push ahead with a sprawling corruption investigation that has already ensnared top leaders of his own party and even implicated Temer himself.\nTemer spoke in the same narrow hall where a defiant Rousseff made what may prove her last remarks as president earlier in the day. He reached out a timid olive branch to his two-time running mate, saying he wanted his appearance to be â€œsoberâ€? in recognition of his â€œinstitutional respectâ€? for Rousseff and of the deep divisions caused by the impeachment campaign against her.\nâ€œThis is not a moment for celebrations, but one of profound reflection,â€? Temer said at a chaotic swearing-in ceremony for the 22 members of his new Cabinet. â€œItâ€™s urgent to pacify the nation and unify the country. Itâ€™s urgent for us to form a government of national salvation . to pull this country out of the serious crisis in which we find ourselves.â€?\nThe Senate voted 55-22 to impeach Rousseff over allegations her government broke fiscal laws in managing the federal budget. Rousseff insisted the accusations are baseless, since such financial maneuvers have been common practice by other Brazilian presidents without repercussions.\nShe was immediately suspended for 180 days pending a trial in the Senate. If she is found by two-thirds of the Senate to have committed crimes, Temer will serve out the remainder of her term, which ends in December 2018.\nRousseff maintained the action against her amounts to a â€œcoupâ€? cooked up by power-hungry opponents bent on rolling back the clock on government social programs that wrenched an estimated 35 million Brazilians out of poverty during the 13 years in power by her left-leaning Workersâ€™ Party.\nShe has said the â€œchief conspiratorâ€? against her was Temer, the longtime leader of the centrist Democratic Movement Party that is known less for a specific ideological stance than for its skill at backroom deal making.\nSpeaking just before leaving the presidential palace, Rousseff said she wouldnâ€™t give up.\nâ€œI am the victim of a great injustice,â€? said the former Marxist guerrilla who rose to power in 2010 on the coattails of her wildly popular predecessor and mentor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\nâ€œI fought my whole life and Iâ€™m going to keep fighting,â€? she said, signaling that she and her supporters may intend to make good on a promised campaign of protests and strikes that could complicate Temerâ€™s government.\nAnalysts say Rousseffâ€™s lack of skill as a politician and Brazilâ€™s tanking economy played major roles in her undoing. The economy is expected to contract nearly 4 percent this year after an equally dismal 2015, and inflation and unemployment are hovering around 10 percent, underscoring a sharp decline after the South American giant enjoyed stellar growth for more than a decade.\nMaking matters worse for Rousseff, the big graft scheme at Brazilâ€™s state-run Petrobras oil company revealed deep-seated corruption that cuts across the political spectrum, ensnaring top officials from the Workersâ€™ Party and the opposition alike as well as top businessmen.\nTemer has been implicated by witnesses in the scandal, but he has not been charged. The impeachment driveâ€™s main motor, former House Speaker Eduardo Cunha, has been charged in the scandal and was suspended last week as speaker over allegations of corruption and interfering with justice.\nWhile Rousseff supporters have voiced worries that Temer might try to undermine the Petrobras probe, the acting leader promised that it would continue unfettered.\nThe probe has become a â€œreference,â€? he said, â€œand as such it deserves to be followed closely and protection against any interference that could weaken it.â€?\nSeveral of Temerâ€™s Cabinet appointees have also been ensnared by corruption charges and other allegations.\nHis choices also raised eyebrows because they are all middle-age or elderly white men ? a particularly sore point in this majority non-white country. Six women, including one black, were included in the 39 members of Rousseffâ€™s Cabinet when she began her second term last year.\nAnswering claims by Rousseff the he intends to dismantle the social programs that now benefit around one-fourth of the Brazilian population, Temer insisted Thursday that the programs would not only be maintained but â€œperfectedâ€? under his leadership.\nStill, Temer also said his first order of business will be putting the economy back on track and grappling with the government budget deficit.\nâ€œOur biggest challenge is to staunch the process of freefall of our economy,â€? he said. â€œFirst of all, we need to balance our public spending. The sooner we are able to balance our books, the sooner weâ€™ll be able to restart growth.â€?\nTemerâ€™s inaugural address as interim president was marred by several bizarre moments, including a stampede by photographers who sprinted out of the packed event to shoot police using pepper spray on a small group of pro-Rousseff demonstrators outside the palace.\nThe acting president also lost his voice halfway through the speech, his face turning red and voice constricting to a croak until an aide gave him some lozenges.\nThe chaotic ceremony contrasted with the motto of Temerâ€™s government ? â€œorder and progress,â€? which is the aspirational phrase emblazoned on the Brazilian flag.\nâ€œThe expression on our flag couldnâ€™t be more current if it was written today,â€? Temer said.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Jenny Barchfield reported this story in Brasilia and AP writer Mauricio Savarese reported from Rio de Janeiro.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

When? the Great Ebola Freakout of 2014 was in full bloom, Spoiler Alerts was here to point out how everyone was overreacting . When the phrase â€œabundance of cautionâ€? went mainstream, Spoiler Alerts was here to mock it .

It means Iâ€™m genuinely concerned.\nI bring this up because Iâ€™m wondering if itâ€™s really such a great idea to hold the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio as scheduled in August.\n[ Hope Solo will go to Rio Olympics but will sequester herself in team hotel ]\nThis has little?to do with Brazilâ€™s ongoing political turmoil (though that doesnâ€™t exactly help inspire confidence that the Games will be run smoothly) and a lot to do with? the Zika virus . Though Zika has been around in various forms?for more than a half-century,? study after study ?of its?current iteration?confirms that itâ€™s a nasty piece of work . There is increasing evidence that this particular strain not only affects pregnant women but puts adults at risk for Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome .\nAnd the epicenter for this outbreak is ? wait for it ? Brazil .\nThis week, in the Harvard Public Health Review , immunologist Amir Attaran makes the case for either postponing or moving the 2016 Olympic Games from Rio.\nSimply put, Zika infection is more dangerous, and Brazilâ€™s outbreak more extensive, than scientists reckoned a short time ago.? Which leads to a bitter truth: the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games must be postponed, moved, or both, as a precautionary concession â€¦.\nRio de Janeiroâ€™s suspected Zika cases are the highest of any state in in Brazil (26,000), and its Zika incidence rate is the fourth worst ( 157 per 100,000 ).?Or in other words: according to the Brazilâ€™s official data, Rio is not on the fringes of the outbreak, but inside its heartâ€¦.\n[W]hile Brazilâ€™s Zika inevitably will spread globally ? given enough time, viruses always do ? it helps nobody to speed that up. In particular, it cannot possibly help when an estimated 500,000 foreign tourists flock into Rio for the Games, potentially becoming infected, and returning to their homes where both local Aedes mosquitoes and sexual transmission can establish new outbreaks.\nBy all means read the whole thing . Attaran is not the most uncontroversial guy in the world , so maybe heâ€™s overreacting. And I donâ€™t think his suggestions for hosting the Olympics in a different city this summer are at all feasible ? the required logistical U-turn would be too massive for this kind of event with this kind of short time window. Furthermore, because the Olympics will be held during Brazilâ€™s winter, and because mosquitoes will be less populous then, the situation should improve.\nStill, there are two reasons why I suspect that Attaran?is not overreacting. The first is that a big global gathering like the Olympics seems tailor made to spread the disease. Normally when an epidemic breaks out, the concern is that people will travel from the infected area to other places to spread the disease, and whether other governments are overreacting to that migration. Indeed, thatâ€™s the cause of the myriad epidemiological freakouts that have occurred this century: SARS, H1N1, Ebola, etc.\nThis is a different question. This is all about whether itâ€™s a good idea to have a major global event in a city that is in the middle of this kind of outbreak. This strikes me as a different kind of debate. Is it really such a hot idea to have a significant global gathering in the middle of a hot zone?\nThe second thing is that saying that Attaran is exaggerating means trusting the International Olympic Committee, which on Wednesday rejected Attaranâ€™s?for postponement . And if there was ever an institution that justifies?the erosion of public trust, it is the IOC .\nI feel uncomfortable writing this post. I feel extremely uncomfortable writing something that agrees with anything written at sites like this one . And Iâ€™ll be willing to change my mind if thereâ€™s evidence that Attaran is exaggerating or non-IOC authorities can be trusted.\nBut for now, itâ€™s worth asking: Is proceeding with?the Olympics in Rio this summer really such a hot idea?\n20+\n	washingtonpost	World

Brazilâ€™s new finance minister pledged Friday to take on even potentially thorny reforms if they prove necessary to jump-start the stalled economy, even as the countryâ€™s interim President Michel Temer came under increasing fire for appointing an all-white, all-male Cabinet.\nTemer, the former vice president, temporarily assumed the top job on Thursday after the Senate voted to impeach President Dilma Rousseff, suspending her from office and abruptly ousting nearly her entire government.\nThe 75-year-old career politician from the economic capital of Sao Paulo pledged that hauling Brazil out of its worst recession in decades would be his first order of business, and his appointment of Henrique Meirelles, the former head of Brazilâ€™s Central Bank, was well-received by financial market.\nThe economy has been predicted to contract nearly 4 percent this year after an equally dismal 2015, and inflation and unemployment are hovering around 10 percent, underscoring a sharp decline after the South American giant had long enjoyed stellar growth.\nWhile Meirelles pledged to take on even politically toxic reforms if his team judges them necessary ? including an overhaul of the countryâ€™s onerous pension system, which allows some people to retire as early as their 50s. But he was short on details.\nIn his first news conference, Meirelles stressed that he doesnâ€™t yet have a grasp of the scale of Brazilâ€™s financial hole and said his team needs time to understand the situation before proposing concrete measures.\nMeirelles headed the Central Bank from 2003-2010, years of expansive growth based largely on the commodities boom. He expressed concern about the extent of public debt, but said he was confident the right policies would restore confidence, investment and job growth.\nâ€œThis can happen relatively rapidly,â€? he said, but added, â€œIâ€™m not saying it will be six months or one month or a year.â€?\nWhile Rousseff was impeached on allegations her government used illegal accounting tricks to hide large deficits in the federal budget most analysts say the tanking economy played a major role in her undoing. Rousseff dismisses the charges as a pretext for a â€œcoup without violence,â€? saying the allegations were cooked up by foes hungry for power that they couldnâ€™t reach though the ballot box and bent on dismantling social programs that have helped pull an estimated 35 million Brazilians out of grinding poverty.\nIn a news conference at the presidential residence where she will continue to live through the impeachment trail, Rousseff blamed her foes for much of the economic debacle. She pointed to stonewalling that started in 2015 at the beginning of her second term and saw Congress reject her governmentâ€™s proposals to respond to the economic crisis.\nâ€œWe, 15 months ago suffered all sorts of sabotage against our governance,â€? she said. â€œThere was a systematic blockage to create the proper climate for the coup.â€?\nRousseff, Brazilâ€™s first woman president, also lashed out at Temerâ€™s Cabinet choices, saying the all-white, all-male appointees were an accurate reflection of the demographic he would be governing for ? this majority non-white nationâ€™s traditional white elite.\nâ€œI lament that after a long time there are no longer women or blacks in the ministries,â€? said Rousseff, whose own Cabinet at the start of her second term included six women, including one black woman. â€œI think gender questions are a question of democracy in a country where the majority, more than 50 percent, are women.â€?\nThe absence of a single person of color has also upset many in civil society.\nFrei David Santos, who directs the Sao Paulo-based Educafro organization that prepared low-income black students for college entrance exams, said it was an â€œaffrontâ€? to the Brazilâ€™s black population ? the second largest in the world, after Nigeria.\nâ€œThe all-white Cabinet is a throwback to the colonial timesâ€? of slavery, he said, adding, â€œWe represent 53.7 percent of the population and yet we continue being shunned, marginalized and shunned by society ? and all this is what Temerâ€™s Cabinet represents.â€?\nHis Cabinet choices have also come under fire for including people who face serious allegations. At least nine of Temerâ€™s 22 appointees have faced or are facing allegations of corruption and other wrongdoing, including in the sprawling graft probe that saw billions of dollars syphoned out of Brazilâ€™s state-run oil company, Petrobras.\nMany top figures in Rousseffâ€™s left-leaning Workersâ€™ Party were also swept up in the ongoing probe. While Rousseff herself has not been directly implicated, corruption inside her party also helped fuel widespread public anger against her, analysts say.\nTemer himself has been implicated by witnesses in the Petrobras scandal, but he hasnâ€™t been charged. Former House Speaker Eduardo Cunha, another top official in Temerâ€™s Democratic Movement Party is facing charges in connection with the probe, and other top party brass are in being examined by investigators.\nSpeaking to the GloboNews broadcaster several days ahead of the impeachment vote, Temer defended his decision to include in his Cabinet people targeted by corruption allegations.\nâ€œWhat I can say is an investigation is just that, an investigation,â€? he said.\nA report in the respected Folha de S. Paulo daily Friday suggested Temerâ€™s governmentâ€™s survival depended on tampering down the Petrobras investigation, known as the â€œCar Washâ€? probe.\nâ€œMichel Temer must strangle the â€˜Car Washâ€™ investigation or the â€˜Car Washâ€™ will devastate his government,â€? the report said.\nIn his first public appearance since assuming the presidency, Temer pledged Thursday investigation will continue unimpeded. â€œIt deserves to be followed closely and protection against any interference that could weaken it,â€? he said.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Jenny Barchfield reported this story in Brasilia and AP writer Mauricio Savarese reported from Rio de Janeiro.

While Ms. Rousseff faces an impeachment trial in the Senate , the country will be ruled by her vice president, who comes from a different political party and favors a center-right agenda. If, as now seems likely, Ms. Rousseff is permanently removed from office, much of the legacy of her Workersâ€™ Party could be undone before the next scheduled presidential election in 2018.\nWhether that is just is a fair matter for debate. Ms. Rousseff is not, as she contends, the victim of a coup: Brazilâ€™s National Congress followed the constitution in impeaching her, and it seems likely she is guilty of the crime she is accused of ? using improper loans from state banks to cover up overspending by her government. As we have said, itâ€™s questionable whether that specific offense justifies her removal from office. But the Congress was responding to a larger record of economic mismanagement that has plunged Brazil into its worst recession since the 1930s.\nMs. Rousseffâ€™s supporters point out that Brazilians never voted for the reversal of economic policy likely to be pursued by Michel Temer , the 75-year-old interim president. While a large majority of Brazilians favored the impeachment, only 2 percent in one recent poll supported Mr. Temer as the new president; in fact, most would like to see him impeached as well. Undaunted, the new leader swiftly appointed an all-male cabinet; while he promised not to cut subsidies to poor families, a signal policy of the former government, he has endorsed an agenda that includes such liberal measures as privatizations of state companies, freer trade and reform of pension and labor laws.\nWhat should temper disapproval of this switch is that Mr. Temerâ€™s favored remedies are precisely what is needed to pull the country out of its economic morass. Ms. Rousseff herself attempted to trim the countryâ€™s massive fiscal deficit before her political problems overtook her. The pension system allows workers to retire in their 50s and forces the government to spend a higher percentage of its gross domestic product on retirees than rich and aging Japan. The state oil company, Petrobras , is the source of the massive graft scandal that has tainted much of the political elite, including Ms. Rousseffâ€™s predecessor, Luiz IgnÃ¡cio Lula da Silva.\nStill, itâ€™s questionable whether Mr. Temer, with his attenuated political legitimacy, will muster the support to pass the necessary reforms through Congress ? especially as some would require constitutional amendments. Legislative gridlock could prolong the recession and lead to a further fraying of the political system. A fresh election could provide a way out, if Congress or the courts provide a mandate. Most likely, however, when the world turns its attention to this summerâ€™s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the backdrop will be a Brazil still immersed in political turmoil.\nRead more on this topic:\n	washingtonpost	World

Michel Temer says his top task as Brazilâ€™s new leader will be to stabilize the country after months of political upheaval. But he will also need to quickly salvage this countryâ€™s reputation ahead of the Rio Summer Olympics and convince the world that Brazil is not a basket case.\nFew countries have faced so many problems ahead of hosting the Games. A Zika-virus outbreak rages in Rio de Janeiro. Crime is surging after the failure of a plan to â€œpacifyâ€? the cityâ€™s slums, or favelas. Part of a bike path built for the Games collapsed into the ocean last month, killing two and triggering fears about shoddy construction work.\nThese troubles seemed to have barely registered with Brazilian politicians consumed by their own crises. A drawn-out, messy impeachment fight culminated in President Dilma Rousseffâ€™s suspension this week and brought Temer to power.\nIn his first speech as interim president, he told Brazilians that the Olympics would be a one-time opportunity to make a good global impression.\nâ€œBillions of people will watch the Games, and journalists from different countries will be here to report on the host nation,â€? he said. â€œWe know that beyond sports, they will also focus on the political and economic conditions of the country.â€?\nBrazil's senators voted overwhelmingly on Thursday, May 12, to put President Dilma Rousseff on trial, an impeachment push driven by mounting frustration in the country. (Dom Phillips,Nick Miroff,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\nTemer may want them to focus as little as possible on those two sore points. But the Senate impeachment trial of Rousseff can extend up to 180 days ? meaning it could still be underway when the Games open on Aug.?5. Rousseff vows to fight charges of violating budget laws and insists that she did not break the law.\n[ Temer names an all-male, conservative-leaning cabinet ]\nOn his first day on the job, Temerâ€™s new sports minister, Leonardo Picciani, issued a statement addressing charges that he has a conflict of interest because he and his family are part owners of a company that supplied gravel for the Olympic Park and a rapid-bus lane built for the Games. He said that the ministry does not contract for construction projects and that the Olympic infrastructure is already in place, so there is no conflict of interest.\nOrganizers say the Olympic facilities are nearly complete and will be ready on time. Still, a subway line connecting the suburb where the Games are being held to the rest of the city has not opened. Officials have backed off promises to clean up the filthy water of Guanabara Bay, where sailing races will be staged.\nWhen a 50-yard portion of a seaside bike path was struck by a wave last month and plunged into the sea below, it also renewed fears of corner-cutting on construction projects linked to the Games. Two people died , and the path has remained closed amid reports that it was not securely attached to its supporting stanchions.\nBrazilâ€™s new Olympic facilities will open under a cloud of suspicion, with the chief executive of one major contractor recently sentenced to prison for 19 years on corruption charges. Executives of other construction firms are also in jail or under indictment.\nU.S. officials estimate that as many as 200,000 Americans will visit Rio for the Games, but for many spectators, the Zika epidemic may be more worrisome than the state of the Games facilities.\n1 of 28\n	washingtonpost	World

Politicians with a Middle Eastern ancestry?are hardly rare in South America. (Eraldo Peres/AP)\nBrazil's new president, Michel Temer, is already a figure of profound controversy. Formerly the country's vice president, he moved into power after?the tumultuous suspension of President Dilma Rousseff was?finalized last?week in the midst of an ongoing corruption scandal.\nTemer has immediately swung the countryâ€™s politics to the right, plotting free-market reforms and appointing an all-male cabinet in the wake of the departure of Brazilâ€™s first female president. The?septuagenarian centrist may not be in power for long, though, given that he is also subject to a pending investigation into the financing of his and Rousseff's 2014 election campaign.?Before he assumed the role of president, Temer was more?widely known abroad for his model wife, who is about?four decades his junior.\nThereâ€™s one detail in his biography that, while irrelevant to Brazilâ€™s ongoing political turmoil, links him to a wider Latin American story. Temer, whose Lebanese parents arrived in Brazil in the 1920s, is part of a diverse and far-reaching Arab immigrant diaspora in parts of Central and South America. And heâ€™s hardly the first regional politico of Arab ancestry to head up his nation.\nCarlos Menem, the disgraced former?president of Argentina, was the son of Syrian nationals. To further his political career, he converted from Islam to Roman Catholicism. The father of Julio CÃ©sar Turbay, president of Colombia between 1978 and 1982, was an enterprising merchant who emigrated from the town of Tannourine, Lebanon. Prominent presidents of El Salvador and Honduras? claim Palestinian ancestry , while successive presidents in Ecuador in the 1990s had Lebanese heritage.\nAlthough many?in the United States?know?of the profusion of Italian, German and Irish immigrants whose descendants now populate the Americas, they are perhaps less aware of other major migrations to the region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In addition to huge numbers from China and Japan, a significant influx of arrivals to South America?came from?the area known as the Levant, comprising modern-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Israel.\nBy some estimates, about?250,000 to 300,000 Arabs emigrated to Argentina, Brazil and Mexico around this time, fleeing the upheavals that beset?a collapsing Ottoman Empire. Many were initially known as "Turcos" because of their Ottoman passports. According to one account , at least 5 percent of all people in Latin America can claim some strain of Arab ancestry, and that figure is probably?higher in Brazil.\nThe majority of these Arab arrivals belonged to various Christian denominations. Temer's family, for example, hailed from Lebanon's Maronite Christian community. Affinity with the Catholic Church, as well as dogged hard work and?savvy business acumen,?sped the assimilation of many of these communities in South America.\nAbout?10 percent of Brazil's parliamentarians have Arab ancestry, with the wider population thought to?be half of that. The ties that remain to the Levant can be found mostly in last names and the ubiquity of Middle Eastern-style food across the region, from popular Brazilian fast-food chains ?to the proliferation of the empanada, a flaky, meaty pastry influenced in part by Lebanese cooking.\nThere are other ties.?The existence of this pronounced Arab diaspora has also shaped contemporary geopolitics. In Venezuela, the country's leftist government?has long had a cozy relationship with regimes in Iran and Syria. Tarek El?Aissami, a prominent Venezuelan minister of Druze origin, is alleged by critics to have connections to the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah.\nChile boasts perhaps the largest Palestinian Christian community in the world outside Israel and the occupied territories. Palestino, one of major soccer clubs in the capital, Santiago, was established?in 1920 by Palestinian Christians. The team? makes a point to voice its solidarity with its distant brethren living under Israeli occupation. That's a sympathy felt more broadly: Almost every major South?American country recognizes Palestinian statehood .\nworld\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	World

(Mohamed Ben Khalifa/AP)\nU.S. BEEFING UP IN LIBYA: Itâ€™s still a very small contingent of troops ? fewer than 25, divided in two teams ? but the new installations at outposts in Libya reflect that the Obama administration is growing more concerned about terrorist threats there, particularly from the Islamic State. The Pentagon has been drafting plans for engagement for months, and the new Special Operations troops on the ground are responsible for finding local partners that could serve as allies in the case of a charge against the Islamic State. Together, they shape up as signs of a new military engagement in Libya.\n[ U.S. establishes Libyan outposts with eye toward offensive against Islamic State ]\nU.S. officials had been trying to wait on stating a policy until after a unity government was established in Libya, which has been split by two rival governments operating in the east and west. But a unity government has been difficult to achieve through U.N.-sponsored peace talks, making it more difficult for the international community to agree and act on plans.Though it is smaller than the organization based in Iraq and Syria, ISIS in Libya employs the same tactics. The United States has more than 5,000 troops on the ground in Iraq, and a few hundred in Syria.\nHEZBOLLAH COMMANDER KILLED IN SYRIA: The leader of Hezbollahâ€™s militia forces in Syria appears to have been killed during a blast in Damascus, the group announced on Friday ? a development that would be a significant blow to the Iranian-backed forces that have played a key role in supporting the government of Syrian government Bashar al-Assad.\n[ In blow to Hezbollah, senior commander killed in Syria ]\nIt isnâ€™t clear who caused the explosion that killed Mustafa Badreddine, the most senior Hezbollah official to be killed since Imad Mughniyah ? who just happened to be Badreddineâ€™s mentor ? was killed in 2008. Badreddine wasnâ€™t just known from his role in Syria ? over the years he had been accused of participation in many high-profile Hezbollah operations, including the 1983 attack on military barracks in Beirut that killed U.S. and French soldiers, as well as the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.\nIS ARMY PLAYING RUSSIA FOR CASH?: Politico has a story that takes a different look at the defense budget and how officials think the Army may be drumming up the specter of the threat from Russia as a way of getting more money at a time when budgets are being constrained. Officials in the story point to a pattern of painting an outsize picture of the threat Russia poses that just isnâ€™t supported by the numbers. Nonetheless, it appears to have captured the attention of the public and politicians ? particularly during an election year.\n2\n	washingtonpost	World

In Syria, he was responsible for the Shiite militiaâ€™s?crucial support for President Bashar al-Assadâ€™s regime, which had been increasingly drawing criticism in Badreddineâ€™s?native Lebanon.\nPerhaps most famously, he was indicted in the 2005 murder of Lebanonâ€™s charismatic president Rafik Hariri in a suicide bombing that took 22 other lives, as well. Badreddine?was being tried in absentia in a Netherlands court when he was killed.\nHe was a brother-in-law of Imad Moughniyah, Hezbollahâ€™s long-serving military commander, who was killed by a bomb planted in his car in Damascus in 2008 that Hezbollah blamed on Israel, according to Reuters. Badreddine took his place atop the group's military command.\nBadreddine had escaped death once before. In 1983, just a year after Hezbollahâ€™s formation, he was arrested and sentenced to death in Kuwait for a string of bombings ? including attacks on?the U.S. and French embassies that killed five ? which were thought to be in retribution for Kuwaitâ€™s support and the Westâ€™s support for Iraq in its war against the groupâ€™s?longtime ally, Iran. His sentence was never carried out, and when Saddam Husseinâ€™s army stormed Kuwait in 1990, it inadvertently freed most of the countryâ€™s prisoners, including Badreddine.\nAccording to the Associated Press,?he?was known ?as an expert in explosives and developed a trademark technique that added gas to increase the power of sophisticated explosives. He was sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2012 for his role in Syria.\n[ In blow to Hezbollah, senior commander killed in Syria ]\nHe?was a man who moved in the shadows and who rarely attached his name to any of his earthly possessions.\nOfficial transcripts released by the U.N.-backed tribunal investigating Haririâ€™s assassination reveal juicy personal details about a man who is otherwise was known to the public through just a few?extant photographs (two?in this article). According to the transcripts, Badreddine owned an apartment in an upscale area near the Lebanese capital, where he apparently entertained friends, as well as a boat and an â€œexpensive Mercedesâ€? vehicle ? none of which were registered in his name.\nâ€œHe had several concurrent girlfriends and was seen regularly in restaurants and cafes socializing with his friends,â€? the prosecution says in the document dated January 2014.\nA younger Mustafa Amine Badreddine. (Special Tribunal for Lebanon/Handout via Reuters)\nInvestigators said?they had found almost nothing with his name on it: no?driverâ€™s licenses or passports, property, bank accounts, photographs, and no record of his ever having left Lebanon. Prosecutors said that he?â€œpasses as an unrecognizable and untraceable ghost throughout Lebanon, leaving no footprint as he passes.â€?\nHis death was as mysterious as his life.\nReminiscent of allegations following the assassination of senior Hamas officer Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai, Israel was immediately floated as Badreddineâ€™s killer.\nAl Mayadeen, a newspaper with links to Hezbollah, reported that he?had been killed in an Israeli airstrike, but it soon?removed that report.\nIsrael typically doesnâ€™t comment on its military operations.\nBadreddineâ€™s death adds to an already heavy toll from its operations in Syria. Approximately 1,000 of its members have been killed in the conflict, and he is not the first of its senior commanders to be picked off in what appears to be a targeted attack.\nRead More:\n	washingtonpost	World

Eric Rasch, of his duties effective May 12.

One of the vessels experienced mechanical problems, officials said.\nNo shots were fired, but the sailors were taken to the island, home to an Iranian naval base, and held overnight before being released ?the next?day.

Russian bombers flying from an Iranian air base struck rebel targets across Syria on Tuesday, Russian and Iranian officials said, dramatically underscoring the two countriesâ€™ growing military ties and highlighting Russiaâ€™s ambitions for greater influence in a turbulent Middle East.\nThe long-range Tu-22 bombers took off from a base near Hamadan in western Iran and launched raids in the Syrian provinces of Aleppo, Deir al-Zour and Idlib, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement. The ministry said the bombers were accompanied by Russian fighter jets based in Syria.\nBoth countries are staunch allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but the flights marked the first time Russia has launched strikes from Iranian territory.\nIran has long banned foreign militaries from establishing bases on its soil. But the raids appeared to signal a budding alliance that would expand Russiaâ€™s military footprint in the region.\nIran and Russia â€œenjoy strategic cooperation in the fight against terrorism in Syria, and share their facilities and capacities to this end,â€? Iranâ€™s National Security Council chief, Ali Shamkhani, said Tuesday, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).\nState Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner called the flights â€œunfortunate, but not surprising or unexpected.â€? Like other Russian strikes in Syria, he said, the Russian bombers predominantly targeted moderate opposition forces fighting against Assad, rather than the Islamic State or other terrorist groups.\nâ€œIt only makes more difficult what is already a complex, contentious and difficult situation,â€? Toner said, adding that it was â€œunclearâ€? whether Russia planned to continue using the Iranian base, or the operation was a â€œone-off.â€?\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry raised the flights in a Tuesday telephone conversation with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, Toner said.\nUnder the terms of a U.S.-Russia agreement to â€œdeconflictâ€? their flights over Syria, the U.S. military was notified in advance that the bombers would pass across Iraqi airspace and through Syria, according to Col. Christopher Garver, the Baghdad-based spokesman for U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.\nâ€œIt was not a lot of time, but it was enough,â€? Garver said of the notice given. He said the Russian aircraft â€œdid not impact coalition operations in either Iraq or Syria,â€? where coalition planes are in the air virtually around the clock.\nAlthough several countries in the region have flirted with strengthened ties to Russia, Moscow has made little headway in fulfilling its ambitions for greater Middle East sway. Syria has long been an exception, historically purchasing Russian arms and hosting a Russian naval facility on the Mediterranean.\nTehran, in addition to their joint support for Assad, has seen strategic advantage in relations with post-Soviet Russia, sharing a desire to counter U.S. influence with increased trade and energy cooperation. The Iran nuclear deal allowed Russia to fulfill a years-old agreement to sell Iran its powerful S-300 air-defense missile system.\nLast year, Russia and Iran signed a military cooperation deal focused on training and on fighting terrorism. On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s top Middle East envoy arrived in Tehran to discuss bilateral relations. Russia has also requested the use of Iranian airspace to fire cruise missiles at rebel targets in Syria.\n[ Syrian extremist group splits from al-Qaeda and changes its name ]\nShiite-led Iran has sent thousands of troops and fighters, including members of its Revolutionary Guard Corps, to Syria to bolster Assad ? who is from the Shiite minority Alawite sect ? against largely Sunni rebels. For Tehran, losing a longtime ally to a majority-Sunni uprising would undermine its own influence in the region.\nIranian proxies such as Lebanonâ€™s Hezbollah and an array of Shiite Iraqi militias have also fought for the Syrian regime. And last year, Russia began its own operations in Syria, committing tanks, artillery and combat aircraft to the fight. It also built a new air base in Latakia province in the Alawite heartland.\nRussian intervention marked a turning point in the fate of the Assad regime, which had been losing ground to rebel forces.\nBut until now, Russiaâ€™s long-range bombers, which require longer airstrips, had to be launched from Russian territory more than 1,200 miles away. Now, those same bombers need to fly only about 400 miles from Iran to Syria, Iranâ€™s Fars News Agency reported Tuesday. The shorter distance, using less fuel and allowing a bigger payload, will allow Russia to intensify its air campaign against rebel-held areas.\nSyrian government troops and opposition fighters are now locked in a battle for the strategic city of Aleppo , where residents face a growing humanitarian crisis. Russia has carried out strikes in support of government troops there, activists say.\n[Battle for Aleppo may be the most crucial in Syriaâ€™s civil war ]\nRussiaâ€™s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that its long-range bombers struck targets linked to the Islamic State and Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, a group that formally split from al-Qaeda last month and changed its name from Jabhat al-Nusra. The strikes destroyed five major ammunition depots, training camps and three command posts, the ministry said.\nBut rights groups have criticized both Russia and the Syrian regime for repeated strikes on civilian targets, including homes, schools and hospitals. Russian and Syrian officials have denied those reports.\nOn Tuesday, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said Syrian and Russian troops have used banned incendiary weapons in civilian areas.\nâ€œThese weapons inflict horrible injuries and excruciating pain,â€? Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. â€œThe disgraceful incendiary weapon attacks in Syria show an abject failure to adhere to international law.â€?\n[ Obamaâ€™s overture to Russia on Syria ]\nIran is also deeply involved in conflicts in Yemen and Iraq, where it holds particular influence.\nIran was quick to provide military supplies to the Shiite-led government in Baghdad as Islamic State militants made their land grab in the summer of 2014, pushing toward the capital.\nIn recent years, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corpsâ€™ elite Quds Force, has made regular appearances on the battlefield in both Iraq and Syria, becoming the public face of Iranâ€™s growing military power.\nDeYoung reported from Washington.

Water has been cut off from hundreds of thousands of people.\nThe last surviving physicians in the rebel-held half of Aleppo a few days ago begged President Obama to help. â€œThe world has stood by and remarked how â€˜complicatedâ€™ Syria is, while doing little to protect us,â€? they wrote. â€œThe burden of responsibility for the crimes of the Syrian government and its Russian ally must therefore be shared by those, including the United States, who allow them to continue.â€?\nWhy would these brave, forlorn doctors look to Mr.?Obama for rescue? Perhaps one of them, through the terrible din of war, remembers hearing the president promise to stand by the Syrian people as they were being â€œsubjected to unspeakable violence, simply for demanding their universal rights.â€?\nThe United Nations called for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire in Aleppo, saying two million residents lack access to running water or electricity. (Reuters)\nMr. Obama made his pledge during an address at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in April 2012. He boasted that he had decreed, in a first for any U.S. president, that preventing mass atrocities â€œis a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States of America.â€? That did not mean that the United States would â€œintervene militarily every time thereâ€™s an injustice in the world,â€? he cautioned. But when it came to Syria, Mr.?Obama was clear.\nâ€œThe Syrian people have not given up, which is why we cannot give up,â€? Mr.?Obama said. â€œAnd so with allies and partners, we will keep increasing the pressure, with a diplomatic effort to further isolate Assad and his regime, so that those who stick with Assad know that they are making a losing bet.â€?\nAlas, that was many atrocities ago. According to the Red Cross , more than 12?million Syrians ? half the prewar population ? have been forced from their homes, with millions more under siege. Hundreds of thousands have been killed. Well over 1?million have been wounded. Iran and Russia continue to place their bets on the Assad regime. And Mr.?Obama no longer pledges to stand with the Syrian people, though he remains clear-eyed about what they are facing.\nâ€œThe regime and its allies,â€? Mr. Obama observed at a Pentagon news conference this month, are engaged in â€œvicious attacks on defenseless civilians, medieval sieges against cities like Aleppo, and blocking food from reaching families that are starving.â€?\nBut the administrationâ€™s response has not changed: a combination of halfhearted support for the rebels, who increasingly gravitate by necessity to more extremist groups; requests to the Russians to behave better; and finger wagging.\nâ€œIt is deplorable,â€? the president said during his visit to the Pentagon.

Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said Russiaâ€™s other â€œconditionâ€? for implementing the temporary cease-fire was that separate routes would be established for U.N. convoys to bring aid to rebel-controlled eastern Aleppo and to the western side, held by the government.\nThe Obama administration, which has been pushing for a more widespread cease-fire, said it would not â€œturn up our noseâ€? at the 48-hour offer. But â€œwe really believe itâ€™s important to get beyond temporary, ephemeral and localized cease-fires,â€? State Department spokesman John Kirby said.\nNews of a possible pause in the fighting came as the world was arrested by a video of a small boy , covered with blood and dust, pulled by rescue workers from the rubble of a building in Aleppo bombed by Russian or Syrian aircraft.\nMedical workers identified the boy as Omran Daqneesh, 5, and said he was only one of a number of children rescued Wednesday. His parents were later said to have survived the attack.\nDazed and expressionless, barefoot and dressed in dirty shorts and a cartoon-character T-shirt, Omran is seen reaching up his hand to his blood-covered face. Seemingly in slow motion, he looks at his hand and then wipes it on the orange leather of his seat in an ambulance as he stares into the distance.\nThe video spread quickly on social media , much like last yearâ€™s image of a dead Syrian toddler , the son of a family fleeing by boat to Europe, whose body washed up on a Turkish beach.\nâ€œBy my figuring, that little boy has never had a day in his life where there hasnâ€™t been war, death, destruction, poverty in his own country,â€? Kirby said of Omran. â€œYou donâ€™t have to be a dad, but I am. You canâ€™t but help look at that and see that thatâ€™s the real face of whatâ€™s going on in Syria.â€?\nEarlier Thursday, Staffan de?Mistura, the U.N. envoy to the Syria crisis, said he had suspended meetings of an international task force working on humanitarian issues in Geneva because â€œthere was no sense in having a humanitarian meeting today unless we got some action.â€?\nThe United Nations has said that the level of fighting in August has prevented aid from reaching any of the 18 besieged areas and cities in Syria, most of them surrounded by government forces.\nBut Aleppo, once Syriaâ€™s largest city, has brought the crisis to a new level of desperation. In recent weeks, intense Russian and Syrian bombing closed the only access road from Turkey, in the north, to an estimated quarter-million people on the rebel-controlled eastern side. Early this month, opposition forces broke through government encirclement of the city in the south to threaten government-held western Aleppo, where up to 2?million civilians live.\nThe United States and Russia, which head a separate international task force trying to implement a cease-fire, have been negotiating for months as the carnage has increased.\nIn a statement issued after news of the Russian announcement of what Konashenkov called a â€œpilot programâ€? for possible weekly 48-hour truces, the United Nations said it was ready to begin food and medical deliveries immediately, once security could be guaranteed.\nThe statement said the United Nations â€œcounts on Russia to deliver its part, regarding, in particular, the adherence of the Syrian armed forces to the pause, once it comes into effect,â€? and on the United States â€œto ensure that the armed opposition also respects the 48-hour humanitarian pause.â€?\nCarol Morello contributed to this report.\nworld\nGet 2016 Olympics updates by email\nOur best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox.\npost_newsletter333\n	washingtonpost	World

A firm run by Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign chairman directly orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraineâ€™s ruling political party, attempting to sway American public opinion in favor of the countryâ€™s pro-Russian government, emails obtained by The Associated Press show. Paul Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, never disclosed their work as foreign agents as required under federal law.\nThe lobbying included attempts to gain positive press coverage of Ukrainian officials in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press. Another goal: undercutting American public sympathy for the imprisoned rival of Ukraineâ€™s then-president. At the time, European and American leaders were pressuring Ukraine to free her.\nGates personally directed the work of two prominent Washington lobbying firms in the matter, the emails show. He worked for Manafortâ€™s political consulting firm at the time.\nManafort and Gatesâ€™ activities carry outsized importance, since they have steered Trumpâ€™s campaign since April. The pair also played a formative role building out Trumpâ€™s campaign operation after pushing out an early rival. Trump shook up his campaignâ€™s organization again this week, but Manafort and Gates retain their titles and much of their influence. The new disclosures about their work come as Trump faces criticism for his friendly overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTrump said Thursday night that, if elected, he will ask senior officials in his administration not to accept speaking fees, for five years after leaving office, from corporations that lobby â€œor from any entity tied to a foreign government.â€? He said it was among his efforts to â€œrestore honor to government.â€?\n___\nTrump says he regrets comments that may have caused pain\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. ? For the first time since declaring his presidential run, Republican Donald Trump acknowledged that his caustic comments may have caused people pain, saying that he regrets some of what heâ€™s said â€œin the heat of debate.â€?\nA day after announcing a campaign shake-up and as he trails in the polls, the GOP nominee said that he recognized that his comments ? which have angered minorities and alienated large swaths of the general election electorate ? may have been ill-advised.\nâ€œSometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you donâ€™t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that,â€? the GOP nominee, reading from prepared text, said at a rally in Charlotte, N.C. â€œAnd believe it or not, I regret it ? and I do regret it ? particularly where it may have caused personal pain.â€?\nHe added that, â€œToo much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.â€? As the crowd cheered, Trump pledged to â€œalways tell you the truth.â€?\nThe remarks came as Trump was trying to rescue a campaign that has struggled since the Democratic and Republican nominating conventions from a series of self-created distractions. Early Wednesday, Trump announced that he was overhauling his operation, bringing in a new chief executive and appointing a new campaign manager.\n___\n10 Things to Know for Friday\nYour daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Friday:\n1. TOP TRUMP AIDE TIED TO UNDISCLOSED LOBBYING CAMPAIGN\nA firm run by Trumpâ€™s campaign chairman orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraineâ€™s ruling political party, emails obtained by the AP show.\n2. AUTHORITIES CONTRADICT US SWIMMERSâ€™ STORY\nBrazilian police say Ryan Lochte and three teammates were not robbed in Rio after a night of partying, as they claimed.\n___\nBolt takes Olympic 200 but comes short of record\nRIO DE JANEIRO ? Usain Bolt tilted his head backward and screamed. He plaintively raised his palms to the sky, tugged hard on his shirt, then tore off the No. 6 sticker stuck to his right hip and threw it to the ground.\nIt had the look of an unthinkable loss in the Olympic 200 meters.\nBut thereâ€™s only one opponent who can really beat Bolt: Time.\nThe Jamaican superstar romped in what he says is likely his last Olympic individual race Thursday night, but finished in 19.78 seconds, .59 short of his own world record ? the one he said he really wanted to break.\nâ€œIâ€™m always happy for the win,â€? said Bolt, who turns 30 on Sunday, in a post-race interview with NBC. â€œBut I wanted a faster time.â€?\n___\nBrazilian police say Lochte, US swimmers were not robbed\nRIO DE JANEIRO ? Brazilian police said Thursday that swimmer Ryan Lochte and three U.S. teammates were not robbed after a night of partying, and the intoxicated athletes instead vandalized a gas station bathroom and were questioned by armed guards before they paid for the damage and left.\nThe robbery that was or wasnâ€™t has become the biggest spectacle outside of the Olympic venues in Rio, casting a shadow over American athletes amid an otherwise remarkable run at the Summer Games. The ordeal was also a blow to Brazilians, who for months endured scrutiny about whether the city could keep athletes and tourists safe given its long history of violence.\nâ€œNo robbery was committed against these athletes. They were not victims of the crimes they claimed,â€? Civil Police Chief Fernando Veloso said during a news conference.\nThe police account came in direct contrast to claims from Lochteâ€™s attorney earlier in the week. The attorney, Jeff Ostrow, had insisted the swimmer had nothing to gain by making the story up. He, as well as Lochteâ€™s father and agent, did not return phone calls seeking comment.\nThe swimmers could potentially face punishment ? probation, suspension, a fine or expulsion ? under USA Swimmingâ€™s code of conduct. It was not clear if the swimmers would face criminal charges, though police said the athletes could be charged with destruction of property, falsely reporting a crime or both.\n___\nSweden and Germany both make first Olympic final\nRIO DE JANEIRO ? Even Germany and Sweden seem to be surprised they are in the womenâ€™s Olympic soccer final.\nMost figured the World Cup champion U.S. national team would be cruising to its fourth straight gold medal. But the Americans were ousted by Sweden in the quarterfinals.\nWith the United States out, many figured at host Brazil and national star Marta would be playing for gold. But Sweden knocked off the Brazilians, too, this time in the semifinals.\nGermany, meanwhile, avenged a loss to Canada earlier in the games, sending the Canadians to the bronze medal match for the second straight Olympics.\nSo here they are: an all-European Olympic final for the first time. Germany faces Sweden on Friday at the iconic Maracana Stadium, with both making their debuts in the title match.\n___\nUS says $400M to Iran was contingent on release of prisoners\nWASHINGTON ? The Obama administration said Thursday that a $400 million cash payment to Iran seven months ago was contingent on the release of a group of American prisoners.\nIt is the first time the U.S. has so clearly linked the two events, which critics have painted as a hostage-ransom arrangement.\nState Department spokesman John Kirby repeated the administrationâ€™s line that the negotiations to return the Iranian money ? from a military-equipment deal with the U.S.-backed shah in the 1970s ? were conducted separately from the talks to free four U.S. citizens in Iran. But he said the U.S. withheld the delivery of the cash as leverage until Iran permitted the Americans to leave the country.\nâ€œWe had concerns that Iran may renege on the prisoner release,â€? Kirby said, citing delays and mutual mistrust between countries that severed diplomatic relations 36 years ago. As a result, he explained, the U.S. â€œof course sought to retain maximum leverage until after the American citizens were released. That was our top priority.â€?\nBoth events occurred Jan. 17, fueling suspicions from Republican lawmakers and accusations from GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump of a quid pro quo that undermined Americaâ€™s longstanding opposition to ransom payments.\n___\nMexicoâ€™s rights agency says police executed 22 at ranch\nMEXICO CITY ? Federal police executed at least 22 people on a ranch last year, then moved bodies and planted guns to corroborate the official account that the deaths happened in a gunbattle, Mexicoâ€™s human rights commission said Thursday.\nOne police officer was killed in the confrontation in the western state of Michoacan on May 22, 2015. The government has said the dead were drug cartel suspects who were hiding out on the ranch in Tanhuato, near the border with Jalisco state.\nThe National Human Rights Commission said there were also two cases of torture and four more deaths caused by excessive force. It said it could not establish satisfactorily the circumstances of 15 others who were shot to death.\nâ€œThe investigation confirmed facts that show grave human rights violations attributable to public servants of the federal police,â€? commission President Luis Raul Gonzalez Perez said.\nMexicoâ€™s national security commissioner, Renato Sales, who oversees the federal police, denied the accusations, holding his own news conference before the rights commission had finished its own.\n___\nImage of Aleppo boy shocks world; Russia offers cease-fires\nBEIRUT ? The Russian military said Thursday it was ready to back a U.N. call for weekly cease-fires for Syriaâ€™s contested city of Aleppo, as haunting footage of a young boyâ€™s rescue from the aftermath of an airstrike shook
 global media.\nThe image of the stunned and weary-looking boy, sitting in an ambulance caked with dust and with blood on his face, captured the horror that has beset the war-torn northern city as photographs of the child were widely shared on social media.\nAn hour after his rescue, the badly damaged building the boy was in completely collapsed.\nA doctor in Aleppo identified the child as 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh. He was brought to the hospital, known as â€œM10,â€? on Wednesday night, following an airstrike by Russian or government warplanes on the rebel-held neighborhood of Qaterji, said Dr. Osama Abu al-Ezz. The boy suffered head wounds but no brain injury, and was later discharged.\nRescue workers and journalists arrived shortly after the strike and described pulling victims from the rubble.\n___\nObama administration to phase out some private prison use\nWASHINGTON ? The Obama administration announced Thursday it will phase out its use of some private prisons, affecting thousands of federal inmates and immediately sending shares of the two publicly traded prison operators plunging.\nIn a memo to the Bureau of Prisons, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told it to start reducing â€œand ultimately endingâ€? the Justice Departmentâ€™s use of private prisons. The announcement follows a recent Justice Department audit that found that the private facilities have more safety and security problems than government-run ones.\nThe Obama administration says the declining federal prison population justifies the decision to eventually close privately run prisons. The federal prison population ? now at 193,299 ? has been dropping due to changes in federal sentencing policies over the past three years. Private prisons hold about 22,100 of these inmates, or 12 percent of the total population, the Justice Department said.\nThe policy change does not cover private prisons used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which hold up to 34,000 immigrants awaiting deportation.\nâ€œPrivate prisons served an important role during a difficult period, but time has shown that they compare poorly to our own Bureau facilities,â€? Yates wrote in a memo to the acting director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. As private prison contracts come to an end, the bureau is not to renew the contract or it should at least â€œsubstantiallyâ€? reduce its scope, Yates wrote. She did not specify a timeline for when all federal inmates would be in government-owned facilities.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(MAHMOUD RSLAN/AFP/Getty Images)\nYou have probably seen this image, watched the video or both. A Syrian child covered in dust and blood sits in an orange ambulance chair, gray and alone. His stunned, mute face has now been hailed a?" symbol " of his country's devastation and suffering. His huddled frame was? photoshopped into pictures?with world leaders, the latest emblem of the international community's failure to bring to an end one of the ghastliest civil wars in modern history.\nThe good news is that Omran Daqneesh, the young?boy pulled out?from the rubble of an airstrike in the Qaterji neighborhood of Aleppo, is alive . So too, according to reports, are his parents and siblings.\nThe bad news is that the conflict that has hollowed out his home town, once Syria's most populous urban center, shows little sign of flagging. And?that, beyond Omran's?heart-rending rescue, there are already too many stories of children who never could sit in that ambulance chair, looking back at the world's cameras.\nThe stunned and wounded 5-year-old boy in Aleppo, Syria, has been treated for his wounds, but the trauma will stay with him and his family for years with few treatment options in the war-torn city. The Post's Max Bearak spoke with a doctor who has worked in one of the few remaining hospitals in Aleppo. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\nWe've been here before, of course. Last year, the image of the drowned toddler Alan Kurdi , his lifeless body resting on a Turkish beach,?seemed to wake up?the outside world to the misery and horror of the Syrian refugee crisis. But despite an outpouring of global woe and lamentation, little changed.\nIn the months since Kurdi drowned, fears over integration and terrorism saw?Europe grow more hostile to Syrian refugees seeking sanctuary in the West. Kurdi's father chose to return?to his ruined?home city of Kobani, along the Turkish border, in a move that epitomized the tragedy and futility of the moment.\nA photo posted by @Khalidalbaih (@khalidalbaih) on\nAug 18, 2016 at 6:45am PDT\nIn Aleppo, the local media activist?who documented Daqneesh's survival has witnessed ceaseless violence and death.\n"Iâ€™ve seen so many children rescued out of the rubble, but this child, with his innocence, he had no clue what was going on,â€? Mustafa al-Sarout, who filmed the video that went viral, told the Guardian . â€œHe put his hand on his face and saw blood. He didnâ€™t know even what happened to him."\nSarout?went on: "These are children bombed every day. Itâ€™s not an exceptional case. This is a daily fact of Russian and Syrian government airstrikes. They take turns bombing civilians in Aleppo before the whole world. This child is a representative of millions of children in Syria and its cities."\n[ The stunned, bloodied face of this 5-year-old sums up the horror of Aleppo ]\nThe Syrian regime, backed by Russian air power, has been relentlessly bombarding rebel-held areas of Aleppo. The city and its environs are contested by a constellation of rebel factions, regime forces, Kurdish militias and the Islamic State.?Tens of thousands of children have perished in Syria's civil war, including others on the same day little Omran was rescued. The conflict has claimed the lives of nearly half a million people since it flared in 2011.\n"Pieces of childrenâ€™s bodies being pulled from rubble are photographed with appalling regularity in a war of indiscriminate attacks, most often from government airstrikes and shelling but also from rebel mortars," writes Anne Barnard in the New York Times.\nThose images of dead kids are less?shared,?out of propriety and squeamishness. But it's a reality that shouldn't be ignored.?Nor too the other real excesses and brutality of the government in Damascus that purports to represent all Syrians.\nOn Thursday, Amnesty International released a new report looking at the abuses carried out in the Assad regime's prisons, based on the testimony of dozens of "torture survivors." The rights group?estimates that 17,723 people died in Syrian regime custody since March 2011, when the uprising against the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began.\nTo be sure, as a February U.N. human rights report documented, both loyalist and antigovernment forces committed?possible war crimes.\nA civilian removes the rubble in front of a damaged shop Thursday after an airstrike in the rebel held al-Saleheen neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria. (Abdalrhman Ismail/Reuters)\nAleppo, once Syria's commercial capital, presents?both a picture of a country's tragic implosion?as well as a glimpse of a future shaped by irrevocable divisions.?The city's west remains occupied by forces loyal to the Assad regime and is in better shape than the rebel-held east , as my colleagues reported last week.\nThe situation remains dire for ordinary Syrians trapped in the war zone. And the strategic headaches for Washington are?no less complicated than at other stages of the conflict:\nThe Assad regime has been boosted by a strengthening Russia-Iran alliance, signaled this week by?reported Russian airstrikes launched from an Iranian base this week. This is despite concerted American diplomatic efforts to?get Moscow to both apply more pressure on Assad and perhaps help?minimize?the role played by Iranian proxies in the conflict.?"The Russians are showing they have options in Syria while they have Washington over a barrel on Aleppo,â€? Andrew Tabler, Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told PBS .\nThousands of Shiite fighters linked to Iran have entered the fray. Tehran has long backed the Assad regime in Damascus, which it sees as an essential ally in its wider rivalry with Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab states. "The balance of power in the region as a whole is also at stake," wrote Youssef Sadaki, laying out the geopolitical chess map in a blogpost for the Atlantic Council .\nThe sectarian dimension of the battle is clear. An Islamist rebel faction?? until very recently linked with al-Qaeda ??was instrumental in lifting a government siege in southwestern Aleppo earlier this month. Its rhetoric is staunchly anti-Shiite and Alawite, the minority sect to which Assad belongs.?It's part of an ever-deepening polarization in the country?"Extremist rebel forces are seeking to drag more people into their unabashedly sectarian rhetoric, which the opposition should resist if it wants to avoid helping Bashar Al Assad" further stigmatize his opponents as radical?terrorists, wrote analyst Hassan Hassan.\nJonathan Spyer, writing in Britain's Spectator magazine, lays out three distinct and unacceptable visions ?of Syria endgame: "What matters is that three outcomes be avoided: the Assad regime should not be permitted to reunite Syria under its rule, the Islamist rebels should similarly not be allowed to establish a jihadi state in the country, and the Islamic State should not be permitted to remain in existence."\nU.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish militias, many of which are secular and more capable?than other Syrian rebel factions, has offered the biggest source of hope for Western observers of the war ? though the Kurds themselves have many critics , as well.?"We're at a juncture in which the United States has been left with few choices," explains Lina Khatib in an interview with the Council for Foreign Relations. "Through its regional allies, the United States should work toward the least-bad scenario, trying to push these groups to embrace moderation and empower the few remaining groups that are not ideological."\nMore on WorldViews\n	washingtonpost	World

The haunting image went viral. Millions shared it on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms.

Neighborhoods in Aleppoâ€™s rebel-held eastern areas have been reduced to smolder and rubble by Syrian President Bashar al-Assadâ€™s warplanes. Hospitals have been pulverized.

The past four years have been hell for Aleppo native Mohib Abdelsalam, as Syriaâ€™s civil war left thousands dead and reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble in opposition-held areas of his home town.\nBut this summer, the 26-year-old rebel said, life got even worse. A burst of intensified fighting has rocked the flash-point northern city, long divided between rebel districts in the east and government-controlled areas in the west. The 300,000 residents of the eastern enclaves suddenly faced a punishing siege and worsening shortages of food, water and drugs amid a surge in attacks by government and Russian fighter jets.\nFor Abdelsalam, an emergency responder who lost four family members to a bombing in June, the horrors have become almost unbearable.\nâ€œYou donâ€™t understand,â€? he said, speaking via Skype. â€œNow itâ€™s like any kind of day-to-day life is impossible.â€?\nThe ongoing fighting appears to be building into an important battle in Aleppo, Syriaâ€™s largest city before conflict erupted five years ago, killing 400,000 people across the country and displacing millions.\nA Syrian man covered with dust carries pieces of metal on a street cluttered with rubble after a reported airstrike on the rebel-held Aleppo neighborhood of Sakhur on Monday. (Ameer Alhalbi/AFP/Getty Images)\n[ Battle for Aleppo may be the most crucial of the Syrian civil war ]\nWinning control of the entire city is a goal that has eluded both sides since rebel forces stormed it in 2012, and the fierceness of this summerâ€™s battles underscores how much both still see it as a potential game-changer in the war . For residents, though, the stakes are more immediate ? and measured in daily suffering.\nRebel fighters this month managed to partially lift the government blockade of their strongholds in the city. Now those fighters ? some of them linked to al-Qaeda ? are expanding their offensive to shell and besiege government-run neighborhoods, which are also experiencing water and food shortages.\nMeanwhile, Shiite militants from Iran, Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan have led the pro-government counterattacks against the eastern areas, while Syrian and Russian planes target hospitals and just about anything that moves there, including cars and people walking to the market, residents say.\nâ€œThereâ€™s no mercy from the sky,â€? said Issam Ghazal, a 50-year-old resident of the eastern district of al-Zeydiya.\nThe situation has prompted dire warnings from aid groups and U.N. officials.\nâ€œIn Aleppo, we risk seeing a humanitarian catastrophe unprecedented in the over five?years of bloodshed and suffering in the Syrian conflict,â€? U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said Tuesday.\nSuch distant expressions of concern mean little to Abdelsalam. He feels as if the rest of the world has left him to deal alone with catastrophes like the one that engulfed his family on June?23, about the time forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were beginning their attempt to cement the encirclement of eastern Aleppo.\nAt about 8?a.m. that day, Abdelsalam said, he received a phone call telling him to rush to his family home in the Meyesr neighborhood. A rocket had smashed into it, and casualties were likely, the caller said.\nWhen he arrived, he saw nothing but rubble where the building he had grown up in had stood. Under it lay the bodies of his sister-in-law, 35-year-old Samar, and her three children: Abdelsalam, 13, Ahmed, 11, and Aya, 9.\nâ€œI just remember seeing them dead, and then waking up on the ground. I passed out. It was too much,â€? Abdelsalam said.\nHe, nevertheless, pulled himself together and helped retrieve the bodies. During the conflict, he said, he had developed strong nerves while volunteering as a first responder during scores of similar incidents in the rebel-controlled part of the city.\nWhat he cannot forget, though, he said, is the sight of his 40-year-old brother Mohammed, who somehow emerged unscathed from the rubble. Mohammed, an elementary-school Arabic teacher before the war, just stood there, Abdelsalam recalled, as he watched a scrum of shouting men pick through concrete and rebar to pry out his wife and children, whose crushed, limp bodies were smeared with dust and blood.\nâ€œHe didnâ€™t talk. He didnâ€™t move,â€? Abdelsalam said. â€œHe just stood there in disbelief.â€?\nShortly after that, in early July, government forces cut off the main supply road to eastern Aleppo and imposed a blockade on the area. People began running out of food, Abdelsalam recalled, hoarding all they could.\nAbdelsalam began restricting his meals to a piece of bread, cheese and, if he could get it, canned tuna. Fruit and vegetables all but vanished.\nThe siege has had a traumatizing effect, he said. He recalled seeing one woman, a mother who had recently lost her husband during a bombing, using paper scraps and pieces of wood to bring a pan to boil in the middle of the street. Her three young children sat around her as she prepared what he thought was a meal.\nâ€œBut when I looked at what she was boiling, it was just water,â€? he said. â€œIt was like she was pretending that she was cooking food for her kids, but she wasnâ€™t pretending.â€?\nBefore the war, Abdelsalam worked repairing computers and cellphones. As the peaceful uprising of 2011 turned into armed conflict, he said, he felt compelled to help the rebellion drive government forces out of Aleppo.\nDuring the war years, he has regularly posted on his Facebook page video footage captured on his cellphone of the aftermath of government air raids. From time to time, he said, he has fought alongside various rebel groups in the city.\nOne such time was earlier this month, when he said he helped fellow rebels launch a surprise offensive to break the siege of eastern Aleppo. He has also worked since to bring in food, medicine and fuel from rebel-held Idlib province to the west.\nIt is a dangerous journey, he said, with Russian and government aircraft targeting anything that seems to be moving in and out of rebel parts of Aleppo. He takes obscure routes, driving at night with headlights turned off to avoid detection.\nâ€œWe call it the way of death,â€? he said.\nBut it is the only way to bring sustenance to rebel areas of Aleppo. A few days ago, a rocket exploded near the Ford Explorer he was riding in. The vehicle was destroyed, but he and the other passenger were not injured, he said.\nAbdelsalam does not expect such luck to continue. But, he said, he must continue with the dangerous missions so that desperate residents can eat.\nâ€œItâ€™s either we fight the regime and win, or we die trying,â€? he said.\nHeba Habib in Stockholm, Zakaria Zakaria in Istanbul and Louisa Loveluck in Washington contributed to this report.\nRead more\n	washingtonpost	World

(Reuters)\nThe U.S. military on Saturday was working with officials in Turkey to get a key air base operational in the fight against the Islamic State.\nSecurity was boosted to its highest level at bases across Turkey during Fridayâ€™s?coup attempt against the Turkish government, a measure typically reserved for when there is an ongoing terrorist attack.\nA U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations, said Saturday that force protection was elevated Friday night to level Delta. That typically signifies a terrorist attack has occurred or that one is considered imminent nearby.\n[ Turkey foils bloody coup attempt ]\nPentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said Saturday that the Turkish governmentâ€™s decision to close its airspace to military aircraft resulted in the halting of air operations at Incirlik Air Base, in the southern part of the country near Syria.\nâ€œU.S. officials are working with the Turks to resume air operations there as soon as possible,â€? Cook said. â€œIn the meantime, U.S. Central Command is adjusting flight operations in the counter-ISIL campaign to minimize any effects on the campaign. U.S. facilities at Incirlik are operating on internal power sources and a loss of commercial power to the base has not affected base operations.â€?\nThe Pentagon has increasingly relied on Turkish military installations as the United States has waged its war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In particular, U.S. troops at Incirlik and at Diyarbakir Air Base in the southeastern part of the country both have a direct role in the military campaign against the militants.\n[ The coup in Turkey could lead to uncertainty in anti-ISIS fight ]\nAt Incirlik, the United States has based A-10 attack planes, KC-135 tankers and unmanned aircraft. An Air Force commander there said in May that his unit handled one-third of all refueling operations for the air war over Iraq and Syria.\nAn A-10 squadron has been based at Incirlik since October 2015, after the Turkish government allowed U.S. strike aircraft to use the base. Use of the base immediately improved how long the aircraft could remain over Iraq and Syria, considering its proximity when compared with?other military bases used by the Pentagon in Persian Gulf countries.\nAt Diyarbakir, the Air Force began staging small numbers of U.S. troops last fall in case personnel-recovery missions were required. The installation is home to Turkeyâ€™s 8th Air Wing and was not planned as a permanent home for U.S. troops, U.S. military officials have said.\nSenior defense officials also said in April that they were planning to place a mobile rocket system known as HIMARS, short for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, somewhere in Turkey to support U.S. operations in Syria.\nIn other parts of Turkey, U.S. troops use an air base in Izmir, some 300 miles southwest of Istanbul, and Aksaz Naval Base, on the Aegean coast. In March, the Pentagon and State Department ordered families of U.S. troops and diplomats to leave the country, citing security concerns raised by terrorist attacks across Turkey.\n[ Pentagon and State Department order families of U.S. troops and diplomats to leave Turkey ]\nIt was not immediately clear what increased security measures were taken at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Turkey. A statement released Saturday by the U.S. Embassy in Ankara warned that the airport in Istanbul still wasnâ€™t safe to use.\nâ€œWe urge U.S. citizens to contact family and friends to let them know you are safe,â€? embassy officials said. â€œWe have seen reports that social media is blocked, but you can contact friends and family by email, telephone or SMS.? We encourage U.S. citizens to shelter in place and do not go the U.S. Embassy or Consulates at this time.â€?\nBut the defense official said the State Department has not requested the U.S. military to reinforce any of its diplomatic facilities in Turkey, which include the embassy in the capital of Ankara and consulates in Istanbul and Adana.

Forces loyal to Turkeyâ€™s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan quashed a coup attempt in a night of explosions, air battles and gunfire that left dozens dead Saturday. (Hussein Malla/Associated Press)\nBy Christopher Torchia | AP July 16 at 2:07 PM\nTurkeyâ€™s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, rose to power riding on brash populism. A former professional soccer player and ex-mayor of Istanbul, he engineered electoral landslides for a party whose pious Muslim base flouted the old secular establishment. In office for more than a decade, he has been increasingly accused of autocratic tendencies.\nThe failed coup attempt against him appears to have only invigorated his leadership, at least in the short term.\nErdogan suffered setbacks in the past. He was forced out of his Istanbul mayorâ€™s post and spent four months in jail in 1999 for reading an Islamic poem that angered the staunchly secular courts of the time. But that experience only seemed to burnish his credentials as a man of the people.\nHe became prime minister in 2003, championing the idea of Turkey as a role model for democratic rule in Muslim countries and spurring its bid to join the European Union, a campaign that has since foundered. Over time, though, some Turks became increasingly concerned about alleged efforts by Erdogan to impose Islam on Turkish life and crackdowns on perceived opponents that raised worries about human rights backsliding and infringements on free expression.\nWhile the coup attempt was underway, Erdogan broadcast a message of defiance from the FaceTime app on an iPhone ? a tactic that later drew bemused commentary from Turks who recalled past government efforts to restrict YouTube and other social media platforms.\nThese days, Erdoganâ€™s critics draw comparisons with the strongman tactics of Russian President Vladimir Putin or Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan leader who died in 2013. Notably, a 2002 coup briefly removed Chavez but in the end only made him stronger when he returned to power, in part because it discredited his foes.\nFor the moment, Erdogan is riding high on public outrage over the coup attempt. He has vowed that its plotters will pay a heavy price, raising the possibility of military purges.\nâ€œHe comes out of this tremendously strengthened,â€? said Howard Eissenstat, associate professor of Middle East history at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York.\nâ€œThis has remobilized a base that was getting sort of tired of him. It gave him at least a moment in which he unified all elements of society against a clear threat,â€? Eissenstat said.\nTurkey has long been guided by strongman cults. There were centuries of Ottoman imperial rulers; then Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the national founder who imposed an unrelenting vision of secularism that benefited like-minded elites; and the military, quick to stage coups in the past when unhappy with civilian leadership.\nOn Erdoganâ€™s early watch, the economy grew and diplomats confidently fanned out across the region. But the early successes have faded somewhat as fallout from regional conflicts, including the arrival of several million refugees fleeing war in Syria, and a breakdown in peace talks with Kurdish rebels weighed on Turkeyâ€™s fortunes.\nErdogan, who switched from prime minister to president in 2014, has pushed for constitutional changes that would give him more power. His supporters have linked his legacy to plans for the centenary of Turkeyâ€™s national founding in 2023, suggesting he has ambitions to stay in power at least until then.\n_____\nChristopher Torchia was Associated Press bureau chief in Turkey from 2007 until early 2013.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

More than 100 members of the military are dead, along with approximately 190 police officers and soldiers loyal to the regime. Over 2,400 military personnel were arrested and 2,745 judges were also removed from their posts by the government. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after calling his supporters into the streets to resist the coup, has reestablished control over the state.\nLittle is yet known about the exact motivations of the military leaders who attempted the takeover, but one thing is clear: This was not a coup attempt against a democratic regime. Neither the government nor the coup plotters were â€œtrueâ€? democrats. This was an illegal attempt to topple a regime that was popularly elected but is stridently anti-democratic in its rule. Under Erdoganâ€™s rule, especially in the past three to four?years, Turkish democracy has considerably declined . Academics and intellectuals have been arrested for signing petitions that called on the government to cease its military operations in the Kurdish-dominated South East Anatolia region. Erdogan recently amended the constitution to remove the immunity of about 140 members of the parliament ? a move primarily intended to expel Kurdish MPs.\n[ Listen: How the crisis in Turkey has been a long time coming. ]\nDevelopments in the aftermath of the June and November 2015 parliamentary elections convinced many Turks that it was no longer possible to change the government through democratic and peaceful means.\nErdogan would?not recognize the results of June 2015 parliamentary elections in which his ruling AKP (Justice and Development Party) lost its parliamentary majority and called for repeat elections in November 2015.\nIn the meantime, he destroyed the peace process with the Kurdish rebels that he started a few years earlier and launched a major military campaign in the Kurdish cities, which left thousands of people homeless, injured and dead.\nThe campaign of violence and fear orchestrated by the regime paid off and the ruling party regained its parliamentary majority in November. Since then, Turkish cities have been turned into battle grounds. The army has destroyed towns and villages in the nationâ€™s southeast,?while the Islamic State and Democratic Union Party (PYD)/Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party (PKK) carried out terrorist attacks in the major Turkish towns ? killing hundreds of civilians, police and the military personnel.\n[ Read More: Turkeyâ€™s Democratic Struggles ]\nFor many commentators of Turkish politics, last nightâ€™s events in Turkey were not a total surprise. The rise of terror, the inability to defeat Erdoganâ€™s AKP government through democratic means, Turkeyâ€™s increasing international isolation and the effects of Syrian civil war all contributed to the increasing likelihood of a military takeover.\nDespite these trends, it is striking that virtually the entire Turkish political class came together to oppose Fridayâ€™s?coup. Every major political party condemned it ? and what remains of Turkish civil society came out forcefully against it. Despite their strong disapproval of Erdoganâ€™s repressive regime, opposition parties staunchly denounced the coup attempt in belief that military dictatorship was not a desirable alternative to Erdoganâ€™s authoritarian rule.\nErdogan is now more popular than ever. Rising polarization, violence and instability boost Erdoganâ€™s favorability and support among his constituents. It is most likely that the government will want to capitalize on its rising popularity and call for early elections in few months. It will not be a surprise if his party wins a supermajority in an early election that would allow Erdogan to move from amending the constitution to rewriting it ? leverage this failed coup as a way to turn Turkey into a full-blown civil dictatorship.\nIn the ensuing days, we can expect that the regime will become more repressive toward the opposition. The increasing militarization and authoritarianism of the government will further marginalize itself from the international community. The media, universities, intellectuals and political opposition will be penalized. This may also trigger a major exodus of foreign capital from Turkish markets.\nSezgin is the director of the Middle Eastern Studies Program and a professor of political science at Syracuse Universityâ€™s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.\n?\n	washingtonpost	World

(Ozan Kose/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)\nISTANBUL ??I didnâ€™t take the reports seriously at first.\nSecurity forces had blocked traffic on a main bridge in Istanbul, and helicopters were circulating overhead. There was also combat aircraft movement more than 300 miles away in the Turkish capital, Ankara, reports said. But Turkey had been hit by recent terrorist attacks, including a devastating assault by suicide bombers at Istanbulâ€™s Ataturk Airport . Perhaps it was just increased security, I thought. The government here often deploys scores of riot police for even the smallest of demonstrations.\nMy initial instinct late Friday that these were heightened but probably?inconsequential security maneuvers, of course, turned out to be dead wrong. The first confirmation that something monumental was taking place came from the Turkish prime minister himself, when he announced on live television that an attempted military coup was underway.\n[ Turkey foils coup attempt; president demands U.S. turn over cleric he blames for uprising ]\nAnkara, where?hijacked warplanes and gunships?pummeled government buildings, appeared to be bearing the brunt of the violence. But in an instant, all hell broke loose in Istanbul, too.\nEmbattled President Recep Tayyip Erdogan swiftly appeared on television to urge his supporters to take to the streets. They did ??in the thousands ? and police forces loyal to him?confronted the rebel soldiers in squares and on bridges.\nFrom my apartment, which is less than a block from Istanbulâ€™s famed Taksim Square, I soon heard the pop of gunfire. They were warning shots fired by soldiers against the crowd, reports said. Then, a few minutes later, a low rumble and a boom shook the building. Well, that escalated quickly, I thought, in an attempt to casually deflect my growing concern. Still, I needed at least an hour or two of sleep before waking again to continue reporting.\nBut as I climbed into bed, a fighter jet suddenly screeched overhead, swooping low enough that it pierced my ears. After years of living in Egypt and the Gaza Strip, I was used?to low-flying aircraft. But the jet's next flyover, so low that my chest constricted from the change in air pressure, precipitated a whoosh and a blast powerful enough to blow open my windows ? and, in the case of the small window in my bathroom ? shatter part of the glass.\nThat had to have been a missile fired, I thought, again recalling the times I covered Israeli air force strikes in Gaza.?But there, we knew who was launching the strikes. Here, who was flying the jets? The renegade officers seeking to topple the government? The part of the military still reportedly loyal to the state? Was there an important government building or security installation?in my neighborhood that I had been unaware of? Is that what the jets were targeting?\nI scrambled out of bed and into my kitchen, far from any windows, when another blast shook the building. I messaged my colleague, Zeynep, who was also reporting on the chaos and lives in a neighborhood nearby.\nâ€œThose jets are terrifying,â€? she said. â€œIâ€™m shaking.â€?\nâ€œMe too,â€? I said. â€œIâ€™m hiding in my kitchen.â€?\nThankfully, in this instance, the blasts were quickly identified as sonic booms ? the sound of shock waves when an object, like an F-16 fighter jet, breaks the sound barrier. But they were unlike any sonic blasts I had heard ? or felt ? before, and that offered little comfort.\nThe booms were still shattering glass ? and were terrifying.?I hunkered down in my kitchen with some couch cushions and my laptop, monitoring the news and listening to the jets rumble overhead. I could hear residents on my street sweeping shards of glass.?\nThere were more explosions ? some distant, unaccompanied by the sound of a warplane ? and others dull thuds, like when a helicopter gunship strikes. The sun began to rise and, to my surprise, I drifted off to sleep.\nWhen I woke up an hour later, I could still hear the hum of helicopters overhead, but the booms had subsided. Live on television was footage of pro-coup soldiers surrendering on one of the cityâ€™s bridges, bathed in the golden morning light.\nThe coup had been defeated, officials said, and democracy restored. But while our corner of Istanbul was spared, the rest of the country reeled from the scale of the bloodshed: 265 people killed, including more than 160 police and civilians.\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

(Murad Sezer/Reuters)\nIn the age of the smartphone, the coup attempt in Turkey perhaps didn't stand a chance. As speculation swirled on social media on Friday night,?a group?of mutinous troops?took over the state-run TRT station ? not a particularly popular network ? and forced an anchor to read on air a statement drafted by them about the apparent power grab. Other military units had massed at major bridges and public buildings in Istanbul, Turkey's biggest city, and Ankara, the nation's capital.\nThe move smacked of a distinctly 20th-century?operation, in which uniformed men with guns could swiftly seize control of the machinery of state, starting with the media.\nBut President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an entrenched and powerful leader, still?had the upper hand. He issued a message?via FaceTime, broadcast by a private TV network, urging the Turkish public to rally to his cause. Mass text messages were sent out to countless people across the country. As a result, the haunting call to prayer rang out from Istanbul mosques in the dead of night at a time when nobody prays. The country was activated and on the streets. The coup-makers were?soon isolated and cornered.\n[ Turkeyâ€™s Erdogan always feared a coup. He was proved right. ]\nMuch remains uncertain about the chaotic events of the past day, including?the origins of the plot against the government. But it seems the coup was ill-executed from the beginning, starting with?the delivery of its message. All?the opposition parties in Turkey's parliament, despite their loathing of Erdogan, rallied to the cause of the elected government and civilian rule. Most of the main branches of the military and security services remained in Erdogan's camp.\nNow, the crackdown has commenced. ?Nearly 3,000 military personnel have been arrested, according to a statement from the prime minister.?Senior officials, including Prime Minister Binali?Yildirim, say the "putsch" was led by a clique within the military outside the chain of command. In addition,?2,745 judges and prosecutors have been dismissed from their posts over suspicions that they supported the coup attempt.\n"The situation is completely?under control," Yildirim said at a news conference on Saturday.?"Our commanders are in charge."\nSources in the Turkish president's office point to the secretive Gulen movement, led by an aging Islamic cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, as the main?perpetrator. They claim that the leading military officers involved knew they would be sidelined by a purge of Gulenists in the ranks in the coming weeks and had to act fast. The Gulenists have vociferously denied involvement.\nWhat happens next is unclear, but experts are concerned that Turkey's already troubled democracy is in for a rocky ride.\n"There was no good outcome," said Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "If the coup had won, the state will be oppressive. If Erdogan wins, it will still be oppressive, because now thereâ€™ll be a witch hunt."\nAs Erdogan's critics point out, the Turkish leader and his allies in the ruling Justice and Development Party, or the?AKP, have presided over a grim consolidation of power?in recent years that?has seen journalists arrested, critical?newspapers and TV stations shuttered or taken over, social media censored and opposition politicians stripped of their legal immunity from prosecution.\n"Erdogan will most certainly weaponize this coup attempt," says Burak Kadercan, a political scientist at the U.S. Naval War College, subdue more of his opponents and move toward building the "absolute presidency" he has long sought. Kadercan expects "a?further deterioration of Turkish democracy or whatever is left it."\nThe Turkish leadership, though, sees?the failure of the coup as a victory for patriots in a country with a long, turbulent history of military interventions.?As WorldViews noted ?on Friday, Erdogan has routinely cast himself as the vulnerable democrat battling the machinations of the deep state ? including coup-plotters who would reject?the democratic will of the people.\n"Every one of them was a tank man," Kilic Kanat wrote in the pro-government Daily Sabah , likening the?coup protesters to the democracy activists at Tiananmen Square in 1989. "And every one of them acted responsibly and with courage. They showed the extent of civilian power."\nYet?the AKP is by far the dominant force in Turkey and has?tremendous control over state institutions, from the judiciary to the civil bureaucracy. Earlier investigations and trials of suspected military coup-plotters?had brought?the army?to heel, despite the ideological differences between the once staunchly secular top brass and Erdogan's religiously minded?nationalist party.\nThe atmosphere of conspiracy and threat cultivated by Erdogan and the AKP had its political uses, and informed much of their campaigning ahead of two parliamentary?elections last year. Its logic ? presented to the party's?religiously conservative base ? seems to have been borne out.\n"There was this theory they presented that opposing the AKP meant supporting coups," Cagaptay said. "Now that theory has legs."\nIn Turkey's deeply polarized political landscape, conspiracy theories whirled around Twitter that the coup was in fact an attempt by Erdogan to further expand his control. Some on social media thought the history-minded leader would see his arrival in Istanbul late on Friday night as akin to that of the victorious Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror.\nOthers are more skeptical.

Opposition political parties that Mr. Erdogan has persecuted quickly issued statements condemning the coup. When soldiers occupied state television, private news media that the president has intimidated and censored provided him with the means to speak to the country. Social media that Mr. Erdogan has been prone to shut down broadcast video of anti-coup street rallies across the country.\nHaving been backed by Turkeyâ€™s democrats after a faction of the nationalist military turned on him, Mr.?Erdogan ought to respond by backing away from his own drive to neuter or destroy peaceful opponents, critical media and independent judges. Sadly, few close observers of the Turkish leader expect such a reversal. On the contrary, the coup may leave a more unstable and less liberal NATO member on the border of Iraq and Syria, headed by a Putinesque strongman whose paranoia and intolerance have been redoubled.\nThough the identity and motives of the military rebels remained unclear Saturday ? Mr. Erdogan offered no evidence for his claim that they represented an Islamist movement with which he has feuded ? their statement spoke of restoring democracy, and it would be reasonable to suppose they objected to Mr. Erdoganâ€™s concentration of power. Having first led his Justice and Development (AK) Party to an electoral victory in 2002 as a moderate, pro-Western Islamist, the president has steadily moved to the authoritarian right over the past decade, while continuing to win election victories. Turkey is a world leader in the imprisonment of journalists ; once independent television channels and newspapers have been taken over by the government or Mr.?Erdoganâ€™s supporters.\nThe regime has repeatedly purged the military, including through a mass prosecution of officers for alleged coup plotting a decade ago. Ironically, Mr.?Erdogan has moved closer to the army in recent years, using it to launch a bloody assault on Kurdish militants in southeastern Turkey a year ago after a Kurdish political party helped to deprive the ruling party of its parliamentary majority. But lower-ranking officers may have objected to his maneuverings in Syria, where he appeared to tolerate the Islamic State before it staged a series of bombings inside Turkey.\nMr. Erdoganâ€™s domestic repression and erratic foreign policies ? he has oscillated between courting and feuding with Israel, Russia and the Assad regime in Syria, among others ? have complicated what began as a warm relationship with the Obama administration. The coup attempt may lead to further troubles. Though the Obama administration eventually offered explicit public backing for the â€œ democratically-elected â€? government, a first statement by Secretary of State John F. Kerry, when the coupâ€™s outcome was uncertain, supported only â€œstability and peace and continuity within Turkey.â€?\nTurkey remains vital to the fight against the Islamic State: U.S. planes operating against targets in Syria and Iraq are based at Incirlik Air Base, which on Saturday remained closed and cut off from local power supplies. But the long-term U.S. interest is in a Turkey that preserves its democratic institutions and civil society. Washington must do its best to restrain any move by Mr. Erdogan to respond to the coup with another crackdown on the secular and liberal forces that came to democracyâ€™s defense.\nRead more about this topic:\n	washingtonpost	World

The 74-year-old is said to be in fragile health. His popular movement embracing moderate Islam has bred a global network of organizations, publications, think tanks and schools, among them dozens of charter schools in the United States.\nBefore Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded that the U.S. extradite Gulen to Turkey because of his alleged role in the coup plot, the charismatic preacher and the conservative leader were staunch allies.\nOn Saturday, Gulenâ€™s supporters denied any link to the violence. In a statement on its website, the Alliance for Shared Values ? the U.S. arm of Gulenâ€™s movement, which is known as Hizmet ? called the Turkish governmentâ€™s claims â€œhighly irresponsibleâ€? and said that the group does not support the militaryâ€™s attempt to take power.\nâ€œWe remain concerned about the safety and security of Turkish citizens and those in Turkey right now,â€? the group said in a statement.\n[Anger and joy erupt on the streets of Istanbul]\nRogue officers of Turkeyâ€™s military declared martial law and attempted to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan overnight, but Erdogan a few hours later said his government is in control. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\nIn a subsequent interview with reporters in his home, Gulen suggested that the Erdogan government might be behind the coup.\nâ€œI donâ€™t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdogan,â€? Gulen, surrounded by woven rugs and books, told the Guardian and other media outlets in a small prayer room. â€œThere is a possibility that it could be a staged coup, and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gulenists].â€? He said he rejects all military interventions.\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry told reporters that the United States would consider Gulenâ€™s extradition to Turkey if there was evidence of wrongdoing by the cleric, who has maintained influence in Turkey through his followers in the judiciary and police. Turkish media reported Saturday that 2,745 judges had been removed because of suspicions that they have links to the Gulen movement.\n[U.S. relationship with Turkey â€˜is only going to get more complicatedâ€™]\nGulen has long advocated tolerance, peace and â€œacceptance of religious and cultural diversity,â€? his movementâ€™s website says, drawing on the traditions of Sufism, a mystical strain of Islam that is generally viewed as moderate.\nIn a 2015 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, he denounced the Islamic State, calling for an end to violent extremism and advocating equal rights for men and women and education for Muslims.\nâ€œThe international community would do well to realize that Muslims are the primary victims of terrorism ? both literally and symbolically ? and they can help marginalize terrorists and prevent recruitment,â€? he wrote.\n1 of 57\nThe scene in Turkey after an attempted coup\nView Photos\nThe nationâ€™s military tried to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nCaption\nThe nationâ€™s military tried to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nJuly 16, 2016 Following a failed coup attempt, crowds wave Turkish flags while celebrating in Taksim Square in Istanbul.

But the men split bitterly several years ago, after Erdogan and his ruling party blamed the cleric for stirring up allegations of corruption among senior officials as well as Erdoganâ€™s son.\nSince then, Erdogan has accused Gulen of trying to seize power from his home more than 5,000 miles from the Turkish capital by using his movement to infiltrate the government and its security forces.\nGulenâ€™s followers have opened private schools around the world, including more than 160 science-, math- and technology-focused public charter schools in the United States. These publicly funded institutions ? unofficially known as the Gulen charter ? are believed to be operated by people belonging to or associated with the Gulen movement, usually Turks.\nAmong the leading schools in the network are the high-achieving Harmony schools in Texas, which have won millions of dollars in grants from the U.S. government. (There is also a Harmony charter school in Washington.)\nSome of those schools have faced controversy, including accusations that school leaders have awarded contracts to Turkish-run businesses over other businesses that submitted lower bids. The schools have also been criticized over hiring large numbers of teachers from Turkey on special visas that allow U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in specialized fields.\nThe origins of Thursdayâ€™s failed coup are uncertain. But on Saturday, some Turkish analysts ? who declined to speak publicly because they are nervous about Gulenâ€™s deep reach into the country ? were skeptical that his followers could manage to pull it off.\nWhat is clear is that for the past decade, even as their relationship with Erdogan frayed and their leader moved abroad, the Gulenists have remained an influential force within Turkey in various institutions of the state, including the police and judiciary. And Erdoganâ€™s government has cracked down on the clericâ€™s movement, starting in 2013 after mass protests against the government rocked the country.\nMore recently, the government has shuttered television stations and taken over a prominent newspaper linked to the Gulenists.\nâ€œWhether or not the Gulenists were involved in the coup plot, itâ€™s obvious thereâ€™s going to be a massive witch hunt in which the government will go after suspected Gulenists in the police, judiciary and officer corps,â€? said Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. â€œItâ€™s going to be big.â€?\nIshaan Tharoor contributed to this report.\nworld\nNews and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11.\npost_newsletter353\n	washingtonpost	World

Yasin Akgul/AFP/Getty Images\nBy Greg Jaffe July 16 at 4:13 PM Follow @GregJaffe\nThe defeat of a coup attempt launched by a faction of Turkeyâ€™s military has left relations between the United States and one of its most important allies in a state of uncertainty.\nPresident Obama called together his national security team for an unusual Saturday morning meeting to discuss events in Turkey and immediately followed it up with a conference call with foreign policy advisers.\nSenior Obama administration officials strongly condemned the effort by the renegade military faction to seize power in Turkey, and the coupâ€™s failure was greeted with profound relief inside the White House and the Pentagon. The U.S. government depends heavily on Turkeyâ€™s support to sustain its battle against the Islamic State and to provide a safe harbor for thousands of migrants fleeing Syria.\nâ€œIt looks like the nightmare scenario has been avoided,â€? said Ilan Goldenberg, a former senior Pentagon official and specialist on the Middle East for the Center for a New American Security. â€œBut Turkey is going to remain really unstable and concerned with its own military machinations.â€?\nMore than 100 coup plotters along with more than 160 civilians and police officers were killed in the aftermath of Thursdayâ€™s chaos as ordinary Turks poured into the streets to prevent the military takeover. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appearing in Istanbul, blamed the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric living in exile in Pennsylvania, for the unrest.\nRogue officers of Turkeyâ€™s military declared martial law and attempted to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan overnight, but Erdogan a few hours later said his government is in control. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\n[The Islamic scholar Turkey blames for the failed coup]\nâ€œI have a message for Pennsylvania: You have engaged in enough treason against this nation,â€? Erdogan said. â€œIf you dare, come back to your country.â€?\nThe coup attempt is likely to heighten tensions between Turkey and the United States, which has increasingly worried about Erdoganâ€™s consolidating power and cracking down on opposition leaders inside Turkey. â€œIt is hard to see how the outcome of this will be more democracy,â€? said Derek Chollet, a former senior White House official and author of â€œ The Long Game ,â€? a book about Obamaâ€™s foreign policy. â€œThe relationship with Turkey is only going to get more complicated.â€?\nErdogan has long criticized the United States for allowing Gulen, who he thought was plotting against him, to live in Pennsylvania. â€œHe has been obsessed with the Gulenists for years,â€? Chollet said. â€œI have been in meetings where heâ€™s spent more time talking about them than the threat from the Islamic State.â€?\nGulen denied being involved in the coup attempt. He called Erdoganâ€™s allegations an insult and told reporters for the Guardian and other media outlets on Saturday that the coup attempt might have been â€œstagedâ€? by the Turkish government. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the United States was willing to consider requests from Turkey to extradite Gulen so that he could stand trial.\nâ€œObviously, we would invite the government of Turkey, as we always do, to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,â€? Kerry said. â€œAnd the United States will accept that and look at it and make judgments about it appropriately.â€?\nA refusal by the United States to send Gulen home to Turkey would probably complicate the White Houseâ€™s already-tense relationship with the Erdogan government. After the coup attempt, the Turkish government closed air operations at Incirlik Air Base, a critical hub for U.S. fighter jets and drones striking targets in northern Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon said Saturday that it was working with the Turks to resume air operations there as quickly as possible.\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the U.S. "without any hesitation, squarely and unequivocally, stands for democratic leadership" in Turkey. (Reuters)\nU.S. and Turkish officials spent months haggling over American access to Incirlik for the war in Iraq and Syria before Erdogan relented. It was still unclear on Saturday whether the shutdown in operations was part of an effort to round up elements involved in the coup or whether it was designed to send a signal to the United States.\nU.S. officials received initial reports, including some coming from Turkish officials, that the militaryâ€™s actions Thursday night were taken in response to an imminent threat inside Turkey. Those reports appear to have been false.\nOnce it became clear that a coup was underway, the White House sought to send a rapid and unambiguous message that it condemned the plottersâ€™ actions.\nThe quick condemnation is likely to help smooth relations with Erdogan, whom U.S. officials have described as complicated, paranoid and unpredictable.\nâ€œErdogan is going to come out of this more paranoid and more authoritarian,â€? said Goldenberg. â€œBut does he blame the United States? Thatâ€™s the million-dollar question. This really is a country run by one man.â€?\nIt is also unclear how the Turkish military will respond and operate in the months to come. The United States has pressed the Turks to shut down their border with Syria in an attempt to stop the Islamic State from bringing in critical supplies and bolstering its ranks. The coup attempt and efforts by Erdogan to purge the top ranks of plotters are likely to complicate the militaryâ€™s border operations.\n[Graphic: What we know about the failed coup attempt]\nIn the days prior to the coup, Obama was able to win Erdoganâ€™s reluctant support for a military push by a largely Kurdish Syrian force to clear the Islamic State from villages that span a 60-mile stretch of the Syria-Turkey border.\nThe Turks, fearing that the Kurds would use the operation to establish a state in northern Syria, had previously opposed it. The stretch of border near the Syrian town of Manbij is the last piece of territory that the Islamic State controls in the area and is critical to the militant groupâ€™s survival. Tense relations with Erdogan could delay operations to seize that key terrain.\nâ€œI think the whole mess has to affect the timeline,â€? said Andrew Tabler, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who focuses on Syria. â€œWe donâ€™t know if any of this will affect the hard bargain the U.S. struck with Erdogan.â€?\npolitics\nNews and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11.\npost_newsletter353\n	washingtonpost	World

His forthcoming book on the Middle East after the uprisings will be published by Oxford University Press.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, speaking on CNN TÃ¼rk via a smartphone. (Burak Kara/Getty Images)\nBy the timetable of recent history, Fridayâ€™s attempted coup dâ€™Ã©tat in Turkey was roughly a decade behind schedule. For the better part of 40 years, beginning in 1960, the Turkish military overthrew governments it did not like around once a decade .\nThe almost-20-year interregnum between the last military intervention in 1997 and this weekendâ€™s putsch created the impression among many in Turkey and the West that the coup era was over. During this period, the ruling Justice and Development Party, known as AKP, and its leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, used both constitutional reforms and dubious criminal prosecutions of senior officers to bring the military under control.\nThis was why it was startling to so many, especially Turks, when tanks appeared on the streets of Istanbul and fighter jets streaked low across the sky. For a few hours, it seemed to those nostalgic for another era, when the militaryâ€™s general staff portrayed itself as the bulwark against the excesses of Turkeyâ€™s civilian leaders, that the military had finally returned to its old form and was resetting Turkish politics.\nBut it was not to be. Although gunfire could still be heard Saturday morning, Erdogan, who looked shaken upon returning to Istanbul from his vacation, nevertheless reestablished control. Why? Beyond the obvious incompetence of the plotters, who failed to arrest the president and the prime minister (something thatâ€™s pretty much Coup 101) or establish control over the media ? Erdogan was able to rally supporters into the streets via FaceTime , broadcast over CNN TÃ¼rk ? there are three related reasons why Erdogan and the AKP have prevailed.\nFirst is that Turkey has changed since coups seemed a routine feature of the countryâ€™s politics. In previous eras, the military could easily intimidate opponents into upholding the secularizing and repressive principles of modern Turkeyâ€™s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Yet as Turkey has become a more complex society and the AKP has sought to integrate the country globally, the conformity of Kemalism no longer works. In 1997, many Turks welcomed the militaryâ€™s intervention to undermine Turkeyâ€™s first experiment with Islamist-led government. A decade later when the military sought to prevent one of the AKPâ€™s founders, Abdullah Gul, from becoming president ? opposing, among other things, the fact that Gulâ€™s wife wore a headscarf ? Turks protested, declaring that they neither wanted Islamic law nor military rule.\nThere had been moments before when Turks defied the military, but the 2007 protests that put the military on the defensive and helped pave the way for Gulâ€™s presidency were a rather unambiguous indication that Turks would no longer submit to the military, no matter how often they were told it was in their interests.\nSecond, previous coups succeeded because they had significant civilian support. When the tanks rolled up to the Grand National Assembly and prime ministry on September 12, 1980, Turks breathed a sigh of relief because the military promised to bring an end to the violence between rightist and leftist forces that had taken thousands of lives in the previous four years.\nThe 1997 intervention, sometimes called the â€œblankâ€? coup or â€œpost-modernâ€? coup because the military did not actually deploy, was the culmination of the militaryâ€™s efforts to cooperate with womenâ€™s organizations, academics, cosmopolitan elites, the media and big business to destabilize and delegitimize a coalition government under the leadership of an Islamist party from which the AKP descends.\nIn contrast, on Friday night, the faction that sought to overturn the government had little popular support. When Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and then Erdogan himself called on Turks to defy what they called an â€œ uprising ,â€? and when both their supporters, and some detractors, responded, it was only a matter of time before the government regained the upper hand: Military intervention in politics has become an affront to whom Turks believe themselves to be.\nFinally, the coup was bound to fail because of who Erdogan is, what he represents for his constituents, and what he has done since coming to power. The Turkish president is a politician of uncanny talents who has captured the imagination of roughly half the electorate that has voted for him in such large numbers since 2007.\nAround the world, only former president Bill Clinton edges Erdogan in terms of political skill and charisma. To his devoted followers, Erdogan has corrected historic wrongs and injustices by overcoming an insular and undemocratic secular elite, given life to a new political and business class, and established Turkey as a regional, even global, power.\nYet it is not just how Turks respond to Erdogan on an emotional level that has made him the most important Turkish leader since Ataturk, but also the very fact that he has delivered. Since the AKP came to power , the Turkish public has enjoyed greater access to health care, better infrastructure, more transportation options, more money in their wallets and the opportunity to explore their Muslim identities in ways that were unacceptable in the past.\nIt is true that over the past several years, Turkey has ramped up repression of journalists , the AKP has sought to remake the judiciary , checks and balances on the executiveâ€™s power have been greatly weakened, and corrupt government ministers are beyond the reach of the law. Yet this authoritarian approach didnâ€™t sway the presidentâ€™s voters to back his overthrow. And the coup plotters wrongly calculated that their show of force would intimidate Erdoganâ€™s supporters. Once Turks took to the streets, they swarmed tanks and detained soldiers until police could arrest them. Indeed, as Erdogan said Saturday, â€œThere is no power higher than the power of the people.â€?\nErdogan has survived and has already portrayed the failed intervention as an assault on Turkish democracy. Yet he seems to have something other than democratic politics in mind. Arriving in Istanbul, he declared the coup â€œa gift from God â€¦ because this will help us claim our military from these members of this gangâ€? ? referring to followers of exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen , who was once a partner of the AKP, but has more recently become Erdoganâ€™s enemy.\nThe implications are clear: AKP will now hunt down opponents ? real or imagined ? with impunity, consolidating Erdoganâ€™s already formidable personal power and fueling his ambition to further transform Turkey.?Rather than an opportunity for democracy, the failed coup will only consolidate Turkeyâ€™s elected autocracy.\n10+\n	washingtonpost	World

The Turkish government on Saturday quelled most of the last threats from an attempted military coup, but it was a greatly diminished Turkey that emerged from the chaos of the night before.\nAs dazed citizens stumbled through streets littered with the remains of tanks and armored vehicles used by the renegade troops, authorities embarked on a sweeping roundup of thousands of people suspected of involvement in what appears to have been a long-planned effort to replace Turkeyâ€™s democratically elected government with a military junta.\nThe widespread sense of relief that the attempt had failed was tempered, however, by foreboding. Turkey, until recently hailed as a model of democracy in the Muslim world, must now confront the reality that this NATO member remains vulnerable to the kind of domestic and military upheaval that once earned the country a reputation as a chronically unstable state.\nThere were also concerns that the unfolding crackdown on participants in the coup attempt will provide further justification for the creeping authoritarianism of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had already been targeting opponents of his government. Analysts expressed concern that opposition to Erdogan would be depicted as equal to coup plotting.\nâ€œPeople here are celebrating, but what they donâ€™t understand is that they are part of a trap that Erdogan is setting for them. Heâ€™s going to use them for his own power,â€? said Ozgur Guleray, 30, a chef at a restaurant in downtown Istanbul who watched as thousands of revelers gathered in Taksim Square on Saturday evening to celebrate the governmentâ€™s suppression of the coup attempt.\n1 of 57\nThe scene in Turkey after an attempted coup\nView Photos\nTurkeyâ€™s military tried to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nCaption\nThe nationâ€™s military tried to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nJuly 16, 2016 Following a failed coup attempt, crowds wave Turkish flags while celebrating in Taksim Square in Istanbul.

Renegade warplanes dropped bombs on protesters and on the nationâ€™s parliament and other government facilities, turning parts of Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, into war zones. The dead included 104 alleged coup participants and 161 civilians.\nThe coup was thwarted in part by the masses of people who swarmed into the streets in response to an appeal by Erdogan, issued over a TV anchorâ€™s iPhone , to come to the help of the embattled government. There were widespread reports on Saturday of bloody revenge killings against rebel soldiers.\nA triumphant and combative Erdogan, addressing a huge crowd gathered in Istanbul Saturday evening, hailed the popular outpouring of support and vowed a tough response to the coup plotters.\nâ€œBy confronting them and chasing them, we will overcome them,â€? he told the cheering supporters.\nHe reiterated his accusation that a U.S.-based cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, was behind the plot, and called for his extradition by the United States. â€œOnce they hand over that head terrorist in Pennsylvania to us, everything will be clear,â€? Erdogan told the crowd.\nRogue officers of Turkeyâ€™s military declared martial law and attempted to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan overnight, but Erdogan a few hours later said his government is in control. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry, during a stop in Luxembourg, said the United States would support investigations to determine who instigated the coup attempt, but he did not immediately say whether Gulen would be extradited.\nKerry also criticized the coup attempt, saying that elections are the proper way to settle disputes in a democracy.\nâ€œI must say,â€? he added, â€œit does not appear to have been a very brilliantly planned or executed event. But letâ€™s reserve judgment until all the facts are in.â€?\nThe Gulenist movement in Turkey denied involvement and condemned the coup effort.\nErdogan and other government officials stressed that the plot involved a â€œminorityâ€? of fringe Gulenist supporters, and the response on the streets indicated that those involved had no popular support.\n[ Fethullah Gulen: The Islamic scholar Turkey blames for the failed coup ]\nNonetheless, details of the coup plot that emerged Saturday suggested the existence of a serious threat to Turkeyâ€™s cohesion from within the ranks of its powerful military, NATOâ€™s second-largest army and a major U.S. partner in the war against the Islamic State.\nAmong those detained were Gen. Erdal Ozturk , commander of the Third Army, Turkeyâ€™s largest field army, and Gen. Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, which controls the countryâ€™s borders, as well as a rear admiral who had until recently commanded the coast guard, and multiple colonels in charge of mechanized brigades and other key army units.\nThe alleged mastermind was Gen. Akin Ozturk , who commanded the Turkish air force until last summer and was a member of the Supreme Military Council. He also has been detained and will be charged with treason, officials said.\nThe air force appears to have been deeply involved, with pilots commandeering F-16 fighter jets and helicopters and seizing control of at least one military air base, Ackinci, outside Ankara.\nSome personnel at Incirlik, a major NATO air base that is home to the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in Europe and about 1,000 U.S. troops, are also suspected of taking part in the attempted government overthrow, a senior Turkish official said.\nâ€œWe suspect that Incirlik was used to refuel hijacked aircraft last night,â€? he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. It appears, he added, that â€œa small group of Turkish troops stationed at Incirlik supported the coup attempt.â€?\nU.S. officials said the United States had boosted force protection levels on bases in Turkey to their highest level, and the U.S. Embassy in Ankara warned Americans to stay away from Incirlik, outside the southern city of Adana.\nU.S. bombing runs over Iraq and Syria remained suspended because much of Turkish military airspace remains closed, and the U.S. government has adjusted its flight roster to sustain the anti-Islamic State war effort, said Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook. Power was cut to the base, but U.S. operations there run on â€œinternal power sources,â€? he added.\n[ U.S. military boosts security in Turkey to highest level during coup attempt ]\nThough the coup attempt failed, the effort will be a tremendous blow to the prestige of Turkeyâ€™s military, and more broadly Turkeyâ€™s standing as a regional power, said Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\nThe United Statesâ€™ reliance on Incirlik for the war against the Islamic State must now be in question, he said, and the trustworthiness of Turkeyâ€™s military, at home and abroad, will be in doubt.\nâ€œThe military was considered the most trusted institution in the country,â€? he said. â€œThe Turkish military will experience a freefall in its standing.â€?\nSome of those involved in the coup attempt appear to have fled as the plot fell apart. On Saturday, Greece announced that a Turkish military helicopter made an emergency landing at Alexandroupoliâ€™s airport. Greece detained eight men aboard, who requested political asylum. Turkey has requested their extradition.\nTurkish authorities also detained 2,475 judges and other members of the judiciary who were suspected of supporting what appeared to have been a far-reaching operation. Evidence seized by investigators suggests that the coup plotters had drawn up extensive lists of people who were to be installed as governors, administrators and heads of government agencies in the event that the operation succeeded, according to the senior Turkish official.\nThe government is still not sure it has rounded up all the coup participants, and there are fears that â€œrogueâ€? aircraft may still be on the loose, he said.\n[ An old-school coup fails to topple Turkeyâ€™s powerful president ]\nNonetheless, in Istanbul, a semblance of normality returned. By early afternoon, the bridges across the Bosporus were reopened and traffic began to move again after a night of gunfire, explosions and violent confrontations.\nSmall groups of residents gathered on corners and debated in hushed tones, and shelves in many local shops were completely empty after a late-night rush to stock up on food and water.\nThe U.S. Embassy had warned citizens against heading to the airport amid reports of ongoing sporadic gunfire, but later in the day,
 commercial flights appeared to be returning to normal. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it had barred American commercial aircraft from flying into or out of Turkey.\nSly reported from Irbil, Iraq. Karatas reported from Istanbul.

(AP)\nBy Erin Cunningham , Zeynep Karatas and William Booth July 16 at 6:11 PM Follow @erinmcunningham Follow @boothwilliam\nISTANBUL ? On the night of the failed military coup, Istanbulâ€™s towering bridges hosted hellish scenes of chaos and bloodshed, as ordinary Turks ? in stunning acts of bravery and defiance ? poured into the streets to halt a violent army takeover of the countryâ€™s civilian government.\nBut by dawn, the once-menacing soldiers who had seized key roads and infrastructure just hours before, could be seen surrendering to police on those same bridges, their hands in the air as they stood in the early-morning light. More masses of triumphant citizens, gleeful that the government had prevailed, came out to gawk at stalled armored vehicles and take selfies with the police who had put down the unpopular putsch.\n[ The latest developments out of Turkey ]\nThe police officers, for their part, basked in the glory as city residents treated them like heroes. In the crowded Istanbul district of Uskudar, a young boy with a Turkish flag posed for a photograph with riot police in front of an armored vehicle seized in the counter-coup.\nâ€œTurkey is in secure hands now,â€? one of the police officers said, although he was not authorized to speak to the news media.\nWhat we know about the failed coup attempt in Turkey View Graphic\nWhat we know about the failed coup attempt in Turkey\nMen streamed through the cityâ€™s squares waving oversize Turkish flags ? red, with the white star and crescent associated with Islam ? and chanting support for the government.\nâ€œI was out on the streets until 6?a.m. I was out with all of my family ? there were 20, maybe 30 of us,â€? said Olgun Gunes, a 41-year-old Uskudar resident and textile worker. â€œThere was a war beginning last night, but we went to the streets and took responsibility for our country.â€?\nIn Istanbul and in Ankara ? the Turkish capital, which saw the heaviest fighting between pro- and anti-coup ?forces ? life slowly began to return to normal Saturday. Shops near Istanbulâ€™s famed Taksim Square reopened, and street vendors reappeared selling roasted corn and wreaths of flowers. Cooks at local cafes fired up greasy Turkish kebab, and residents flocked to street-side cafes to drink hot tea in the afternoon sun.\nBut things felt different, many residents said.\nLocal muezzins, those appointed to perform the Muslim call to prayer, led sermons from the early morning and into the evening, on orders of the Religious Affairs Directorate. On televisions, which were switched on everywhere, there was news of arrests of coup plotters, purges of judges and a tense standoff at a military headquarters in Ankara, where soldiers were holed up.\nFlights to and from Istanbulâ€™s Ataturk Airport resumed, were suspended and then resumed again, causing travel chaos at one of the worldâ€™s busiest international hubs. Ankaraâ€™s airport remained closed, reports said.\nIn Istanbul, even opponents of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who at one point on Friday night addressed the nation via a smartphone video chat, said they did not want to see him shoved aside in a coup. It would set back the country for years, they said.\n1 of 57\nThe scene in Turkey after an attempted coup\nView Photos\nTurkeyâ€™s military tried to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nCaption\nThe nationâ€™s military tried to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nJuly 16, 2016 Following a failed coup attempt, crowds wave Turkish flags while celebrating in Taksim Square in Istanbul.

But only a few people were out on the streets.\nSedat Demircan, 57, retired from foreign trade business, was out looking for fresh bread.\nâ€œI want Recep Tayyip Erdogan to go, but not like this,â€? he said.\nHakan Sengezen was at his shop, where he sells purses, luggage and backpacks. He said the streets were filled with rumors about who was behind the coup. Sengezen said he wasnâ€™t sure what to think.\nâ€œI do not want a coup,â€? he said. â€œEvery time there is a coup the country goes back 10 or 20 years, in terms of the economy, in terms of security. I donâ€™t want the military to rule. They interfere with everything. They institute curfews; they interfere with how people dress.â€?\nGizem Oktay, 23, was at a party with friends in the Taksim district when news of the coup broke and everyone rushed home. Her father is an officer in the Turkish army.\nâ€œWhen I got back to the barracks, the soldiers were waiting at the ready at the entrance. They rushed us in,â€? she said. â€œIt was fairly calm here, but in the morning the police came and are not allowing any entry or exit.â€?\nOn Saturday evening, several thousand people rallied in Taksim Square to celebrate the failure of the attempted coup. Young men and women waved Turkish flags, and many others wore them as capes as they sang, danced and chanted both nationalist and Islamic slogans.\nPolice vehicles with water cannons stood at the entrance to the square. Young men ? some with selfie sticks ? scaled the squareâ€™s monument, where revelers had stuck a Turkish flag in the hand of the statue of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of the modern Turkish republic.\nâ€œGod is great! God is great! God is great!â€? yelled a group of bearded men in white robes and sandals ? clothing typically worn by the religiously conservative. Standing near them were women in tight jeans who clapped their hands, whistled and chanted, â€œTurkey! Turkey!â€?\nThe crowds were diverse and included people who most likely are divided when it comes to Turkeyâ€™s combustible domestic politics. Some of the revelers struck a more somber tone and prayed amid the celebrations. Others crowded into cars on nearby streets, honking their horns and blaring music by popular American rappers such as Pitbull.\nOne man, who identified himself as Russell but declined to give his last name, said he came to the bustling downtown shopping district to demonstrate support for Turkish democracy. â€œThis is about keeping our country away from military rulers. The people should be running Turkey,â€? the 29-year-old marketing executive from Istanbul said. â€œThis is not about Erdogan.â€?\nHe was referring to Erdoganâ€™s call to Turks to take to the streets in a show of support.\nThe Turkish leader nevertheless appeared to have a large number of supporters at the rally in Taksim, as well as at another celebration at Istanbulâ€™s main international airport. â€œErdogan! Erdogan!â€? yelled a group of veiled women who walked between cars stuck in a mile-long traffic jam near the airport.\nBooth reported from Jerusalem.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the nation Saturday that his government was working to crush a coup attempt after a night of explosions, air battles and gunfire across the capital. Officials said the coup appeared to have failed as Turks took to the streets overnight to confront troops attempting to take over the country. (Andreas Rosar/dpa via AP) (Associated Press)\nBy Associated Press July 16 at 8:17 PM\nWorld leaders expressed support for Turkey and its democratic institutions on Saturday after the government quashed an attempted military coup.\nITALY\nItalian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said Turkish authorities must do their utmost to ensure â€œrespect for the rule of law, of fundamental rights and of parliamentâ€™s roleâ€? following the failed military coup.\nIn a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry Saturday evening, Gentiloni expressed â€œreliefâ€? that Turkey thwarted what he calls a â€œmilitary adventure that would have brought the country into chaos with the return of ghosts of the past.â€?\nGentiloni also said that, â€œprompt re-establishment of constitutional order and stability is urgent and necessaryâ€? but that must occur without â€œindulging in the logic of violence.â€?\n___\nGERMANY\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she condemns the coup attempt in Turkey, saying democratic institutions must be respected.\nMerkel told reporters at the chancellery in Berlin on Saturday that it was â€œtragic that so many people paid for this coup attempt with their livesâ€? and urged an end to the bloodshed.\nShe said â€œGermany stands on the side of all of those in Turkey who defend democracy and the rule of law.â€?\n___\nEUROPEAN UNION\nThe European Unionâ€™s foreign affairs chief said it is â€œindispensableâ€? that Turkey regain stability, following a failed military coup.\nThe Italian news agency ANSA Saturday further quoted Federica Mogherini as telling it and another Italian agency AGI in a joint interview that it is imperative that â€œa dangerous spiral of violenceâ€? isnâ€™t fueled.\nMogherini was also quoted as calling on Turkey to respect the law, rule of law and democratic conventions, calling them â€œbinding and inalienable principlesâ€? which are also the â€œbest way to face the difficulties that Turkey is experiencing.â€?\n___\nRUSSIA\nRussiaâ€™s Foreign Ministry expressed concern about tensions in Turkey in the wake of an attempted military coup.\nâ€œThe aggravation of the political situation in the context of the terrorist threats existing in the country and armed conflict in the region carry a high risk to international and regional stability,â€? the ministry said in a statement Saturday. â€œWe call on the government and people of Turkey to solve the existing problems without violence, to respect the constitutional order.â€?\nTensions between Russia and Turkey have been strong since last fall when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near the border with Syria. However, relations appeared to be moving toward repair after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued an apology for the incident last month.\n___\nUNITED STATES\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States would entertain an extradition request for exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkeyâ€™s president blames for a failed coup.\nBut Kerry added that Turkeyâ€™s government would have to present evidence of Gulenâ€™s wrongdoing that withstands scrutiny.\nWhile visiting Luxembourg, Kerry said Turkey hasnâ€™t made a request to extradite the Pennsylvania-based Gulen. But he said he anticipates questions about Gulen, who has condemned the coup attempt.\nKerry said on Saturday the U.S. opposed any attempt to overthrow a democratically elected leader and change must come through a constitutional process.\n___\nISRAEL\nA statement from the Israeli Foreign Ministry said it respects the democratic process in Turkey and looks forward to the continued reconciliation between the countries.\nIsrael and Turkey recently struck a broad reconciliation pact to restore diplomatic relations after six years of animosity between the once-close Mideast powers following a deadly Israeli naval raid to stop an activist flotilla aiming to breach the Gaza blockade.\nRelations between Israel and Turkey began to decline soon after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose party has Islamist roots, came to power in 2003.\nSince then, Erdogan has sought closer ties with Muslim nations while trying to distance his country from Israel. Erdoganâ€™s close ties with Gazaâ€™s Islamic Hamas rulers have further strained ties.\n___\nPAKISTAN\nAn aide to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attempted coup in a statement and said Pakistan â€œhopes that peace and normalcy will be restored in Turkey.â€?\nTariq Fatimi also said he had contacted Turkeyâ€™s foreign minister to express solidarity with Turkeyâ€™s government and democratic institutions.\nPakistanâ€™s main political parties have also praised the people of Turkey for foiling the coup.\nSharif was himself overthrown in a 1999 coup led by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan until 2008.\nA Pakistani non-profit organization organized a pro-Erdogan demonstration in the capital Islamabad to pay tribute to the Turkish people and their leader for foiling the coup attempt.\nDozens of supporters of the Khubaib Foundation, which works mainly on education and support of orphans, gathered near the National Press Club Saturday and chanted slogans in favor of the Turkish government and President Erdogan.\nHolding Turkish and Pakistani flags and displaying banners written in Turkish and Urdu, demonstrator chanted â€œLong live the Turkish people.â€? One banner in Urdu read â€œThe Pakistani nation salutes the people of Turkey and Erdogan for sustaining democracy.â€?\nThe foundationâ€™s chairman Nadeem Ahmed Khan said the Turkish peopleâ€™s success in foiling the coup attempt is a triumph of democracy and human rights.\n___\nBRITAIN\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he had spoken to his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to underline support for Turkeyâ€™s â€œdemocratic elected government and institutionsâ€? in the wake of the overnight coup attempt.\nThe Foreign Office is advising Britons in Turkey to stay indoors, avoid public places, especially demonstrations, and remain vigilant.\nBritish Airways said it is canceling all flights to and from Turkey Saturday, but budget airline easyJet said it plans to runs its scheduled flights, largely to Turkish resort towns. The airline said the schedule â€œwill be kept under continuous review.â€?\n___\nSPAIN\nSpainâ€™s acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo condemned the attempted coup, telling Spanish national television that his government completely supports the Turkish government headed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nHe says â€œwithout a doubt we support respecting the constitution and democratically elected institutions, and we condemn all coups without reservation.â€?\nGarcia Margallo spoke by telephone from Mongolia, where he is attending the ASEM Asia-Europe Meeting.\n____\nCANADA\nCanadaâ€™s foreign affairs minister commended the people of Turkey for defending their democracy and civilian rule.\nâ€œWe are relieved that democracy has been preserved and that the democratically elected government remains in power. We are also encouraged by the gradual return to stability today,â€? Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion said in a statement.\nâ€œWe stand with Turkey, a strong partner and NATO ally, as it recovers from these unsettling events. We are confident that the government and the people of Turkey will persevere against these challenges in an orderly and peaceful manner.â€?\nThe federal government is offering consular assistance to Canadians in Turkey, and Dion noted the government received more than 600 inquiries from Canadians on Friday and Saturday, either in Turkey or with family in Turkey.\nIn Canada, organizers of the Edmonton Turkish Festival announced on their website that they had decided to postpone the event this weekend, â€œdue to political unrest in Turkey.â€? The website said the festival, which was to feature Turkish music, folk dances and cuisine, would be rescheduled for a later date.\n___\nSYRIAN OPPOSITION\nThe exiled Syrian opposition congratulated the Turkish people for halting the attempted military coup.\nThe Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition said Turkey has protected its democratic institutions â€œin the face of dark and desperate attempts that sought to take control of the popular will.â€?\nIt said the Turkish people value democracy and â€œwill not let a group of putschists take it away in a desperate attempt to restore military rule.â€?\nTurkey has been one of the main backers of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad, and is hosting some 2.7 million Syrian refugees.\nIn the early hours of the attempted coup, celebratory gunfire broke out across Damascus. The government and its supporters view the rebels as terrorists and consider Turkey to be one of their chief sponsors.\n___\nHAMAS\nThe Islamic militant group Hamas congratulated Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for
 quashing a â€œviciousâ€? plot to overthrow him.\nThe Turkish leader has been a staunch supporter of Hamas and a fierce critic of Israel. Hamas said it remembers Turkeyâ€™s â€œwise leadership in supporting the Palestinian people and their causeâ€? and working to lift the blockade on Gaza, the coastal territory ruled by the group.\nHamas supporters took to the streets in several places across the Gaza Strip to celebrate the failure of the coup, raising Turkish flags and posters bearing Erdoganâ€™s image.\nTurkey recently restored ties with Israel after a six-year lull following a deadly Israeli naval raid to stop an activist flotilla aiming to breach the Gaza blockade.\n___\nQATAR\nThe Gulf nation of Qatar, which has close ties to Erdoganâ€™s government, was quick to condemn the military coup attempt.\nIt called the attempted coup a â€œviolation of the constitutional legitimacyâ€? in Turkey and said it supports all legal measures the government takes to maintain security and stability.\nThe official Qatar News Agency said the ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, has spoken with Erdogan by phone to express Qatarâ€™s support.\nQatar and Turkey have grown increasingly close in recent years, and share similar stances on their support for Syrian rebel groups and the Muslim Brotherhood. The two countries agreed last year to establish a Turkish military base in Qatar.\n___\nIRAN\nIran said the attempted military coup in Turkey was â€œdoomed to fail.â€?\nForeign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as praising the â€œbrave defense by the people of Turkey of their democracy and elected government.â€?\nHe said the events in neighboring Turkey prove â€œthat coup dâ€™etat has no place and is doomed to fail in our region.â€?\n___\nSUDAN\nSudanese President Omar Bashir condemned the attempted coup in Turkey and expressed support for the government.\nBashir, who himself came to power in a 1989 military coup, said in a statement that the â€œSudanese people and government stand alongside President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his government and the people of Turkey.â€?\nSudanâ€™s Foreign Ministry congratulated â€œTurkey, its president, government and people for the decisive victory of the national will.â€?\n___\nAZERBAIJAN\nThe president of Turkeyâ€™s neighbor Azerbaijan condemned the attempted coup.\nPresident Ilham Aliev was concerned about developments in Turkey and â€œwelcomed measures taken to prevent the attempt at a coup and to stabilize the situation,â€? spokesman Ali Hasanov said.\nAzerbaijan is a Turkic nation and its late president Geidar Aliev once described their relations as â€œone nation, two statesâ€? -- a phrase later echoed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n___\nTURKMENISTAN\nTurkmenistan said the coup attempt has caused â€œserious anxiety.â€?\nThe Foreign Ministry said President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov â€œexpressed support for the Turkish people and government and also firm confidence in stabilizing the situation in Turkey.â€?\nTurkmenistan is ethnically Turkic but does not share a border with Turkey.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Chanting, dancing and waving flags, tens of thousands of Turks marched through the streets into the wee hours Sunday in half a dozen cities to defend democracy and support the countryâ€™s long-time leader after a failed military coup shocked the nation.\nIt was an emotional display by Turks, who rallied in headscarves and long dresses, T-shirts and work boots, some walking hand-in-hand with their children. Rather than toppling Turkeyâ€™s strongman president, the attempted coup that left some 265 dead and 1,440 wounded appears to have bolstered Recep Tayyip Erdoganâ€™s popularity and grip on power.\nâ€œJust a small group from Turkish armed forces stood up against our government ... but we, the Turkish nation, stand together and repulse it back,â€? Gozde Kurt, a 16-year-old student at the rally in Istanbul, said Sunday morning.\nSecurity forces on Sunday rounded up 52 more military officers for alleged coup links and issued detention orders for 53 more judges and prosecutors, continuing the purge of judges seen as government opponents. Officials say about 3,000 soldiers, including officers, are already in detention. Almost a similar number of judges and prosecutors have been dismissed.\nPrime Minister Binali Yildirim said the perpetrators of Fridayâ€™s failed coup â€œwill receive every punishment they deserve,â€? and the government said it would take steps toward extraditing a U.S.-based cleric it accused of fomenting the uprising.\n___\n2 new arrests in Nice truck attack, as IS claim studied\nNICE, France ? French authorities detained two more people Sunday in the investigation into the Bastille Day truck attack on the Mediterranean city of Nice that killed at least 84 people, as authorities try to determine whether the slain attacker was a committed religious extremist or just a very angry man.\nA man and a woman were detained Sunday morning in Nice, according to an official with the Paris prosecutorâ€™s office, which oversees national terrorism investigations. The official provided no details on their identities, and said five people detained previously remain in custody. Neighbors told The Associated Press that the attackerâ€™s estranged wife was among them.\nInvestigators are hunting for possible accomplices to truck driver Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a 31-year-old Tunisian who had lived in Nice for years. He was killed by police after ramming his truck through crowds on Niceâ€™s famed seafront after a holiday fireworks display Thursday night.\nThe Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but itâ€™s unclear whether Bouhlel had concrete links to the group. The IS statement said he was following their calls to target citizens of countries fighting the extremists.\nFrench officials did not dispute the claim but they have not provided concrete evidence of a connection.\n___\nOn eve of convention, an underwhelming rollout of GOP ticket\nNEW YORK ? While the Donald Trump-Mike Pence presidential ticket made its debut at a weekend event that was awkward at times, it highlights a pairing designed in part to bring together fractious elements of the Republican Party on the eve of its national convention.\nTrump spent more time talking about himself, â€œcrookedâ€? Hillary Clinton and standard policy positions than he did praising running mate Mike Pence in a nearly 30-minute introduction. He lauded Penceâ€™s personal character and conservative credentials and pointed to his record as governor of Indiana.\nThe trappings of a presumptive nomineeâ€™s most significant announcement were missing in the Manhattan hotel ballroom where a few hundred supporters gathered Saturday morning. Nowhere in sight were â€œTrump/Penceâ€? signs, for example, and Trumpâ€™s decision had been tweeted the previous day, stealing any sense of surprise from the event. Choosing a venue in a state Trump has little chance of winning also broke with traditional politicking strategy.\nâ€œAll right, back to Mike Pence,â€? Trump said at one point after a long tangent talking about the Republican Partyâ€™s efforts to overturn rules that limit church leadersâ€™ political involvement. He called Pence a â€œsolid, solid personâ€? and mused at one point, â€œWhat a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence.â€?\nTrump and his new running mate appeared on stage together only briefly before Trump disappeared and Pence gave a speech that closely hewed to the populist themes that Trump has voiced, describing himself as â€œreally just a small-town boy.â€? He praised Trump effusively as â€œa good man,â€? a fighter, a legendary businessman and a patriotic American.\n___\nPakistani police arrest brother of slain model\nMULTAN, Pakistan ? Pakistani police say the brother of slain model Qandeel Baloch has confessed to strangling her to death for â€œfamily honorâ€? because she posted â€œshamefulâ€? pictures on Facebook.\nBaloch had stirred controversy by posting pictures online of herself with a prominent Muslim cleric. She was found dead on Saturday at her family home in the central city of Multan. Her brother, Waseem Azeem, was arrested Sunday.\nMultan police chief Akram Azhar says authorities will charge Azeem with murder and seek the â€œmaximum punishment.â€? Murder carries a potential death sentence, but under Pakistani law the family of the victim would be able to pardon him.\nNearly 1,000 women are killed by close relatives in Pakistan each year in so-called â€œhonor killingsâ€? for violating conservative norms on love and marriage.\n___\n___\nTrump presents â€˜partnerâ€™ Pence, but no doubt whoâ€™s the star\nNEW YORK ? Donald Trump presented running mate Mike Pence to the nation Saturday, hailing the Indiana governor as his â€œfirst choiceâ€? and â€œmy partner in the campaign.â€? But he left no doubt in a sometimes awkward event that Penceâ€™s role will surely be as sidekick to the businessman-turned-reality-star-turned-politician at the top of the ticket.\nGlancing at notes, Trump lauded Penceâ€™s personal character and conservative credentials. Then he moved on to draw sharp contrasts between the newly formed Republican team and Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nYet the announcement lacked much of the stagecraft typically associated with the public unveiling of a running mate, one of the most significant moments under a presidential campaignâ€™s control.\nThe only sign onstage in the Manhattan hotel ballroom bore only Trumpâ€™s name. The two men appeared together just briefly. And Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, spoke for nearly 30 minutes before calling Pence to the stage.\nHis far-ranging remarks devoted more time to recapping his primary victories ? and he even found time to tout his new hotel in Washington ? than introducing the relatively unknown Pence to Americaâ€™s voters.\n___\nReport: Saudi womenâ€™s lives dictated by male guardianship\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates ? Saudi Arabiaâ€™s guardianship system, which bars women from traveling abroad, obtaining a passport, marrying or exiting prison without the consent of a male relative, remains the most significant impediment to realizing womenâ€™s rights in the kingdom, according to a report released Sunday by a leading human rights group.\nThe Human Rights Watch study takes on increasing significance as the kingdom works to implement its â€œVision 2030â€? and â€œNational Transformation Planâ€? to wean the country off its dependence on oil, including government targets to boost womenâ€™s participation in the workforce.\nThe report also comes just seven months after Saudi women were allowed the right to run and vote for the first time in the countryâ€™s only local elections, for municipal council seats.\nThe report finds that even with these greater opportunities, a womanâ€™s life in Saudi Arabia rests largely on â€œthe good willâ€? of her male guardian ? often a father, husband, brother, or in some cases her son.\nA 25-year-old referred to as Zahra in the report says her father used to beat her so severely that at one point she temporarily lost her vision and had to be taken to a hospital. Though her parents divorced and she lived with her mother, her father remains her legal guardian. He refused to allow her to study abroad on scholarship and she cannot travel abroad for work without his permission.\n___\nBritish Open showdown: Stenson leads Mickelson by a shot\nTROON, Scotland ? Henrik Stenson and Phil Mickelson delivered what everyone expects out of a major championship.\nThey matched birdies and improbable par saves. Momentum could change with any shot. The lead changed four times over four hours of golf at its highest level, played in the cold wind and occasional rain off the Irish Sea. All the British Open lacked Saturday was a winner.\nTurns out this was only the preview to a duel at Royal Troon.\nStenson took the lead for the last time with another two-shot swing on an inward par 3, and he kept it with a nifty up-and-down on the 18th for par and a 3-under 68, the second straight day that no one had a better score.\nThat gave the 40-year-old Swede his first lead in a major, even if it was just one shot over someone who already has five majors and his name on the claret jug.\n___\nOfficials: Man shoots at â€˜Pokemon Goâ€™ players outside house\nPALM COAST, Fla. ? Authorities say a Florida man fired shots at two late-night â€œPokemon Goâ€? players in a car outside his house but no one was injured.\nFlagler County Sheriffâ€™s Office spokesman James Troiano says in a news release that the homeowner awoke to a noise outside about 1:30 a.m. Saturday and saw a car
 sitting in the road in front of his house. He told authorities he got a handgun and approached the vehicle.\nTroiano says the two teens in the car sped away and the man fired several shots at them.\nLater that morning, he says, the mother of one of the teens called the sheriffâ€™s office when they realized the car had a flat tire and several bullet holes in it.

Two years after the chokehold death of Eric Garner made â€œI canâ€™t breatheâ€? a rallying cry for protests over police killings of black men, federal authorities are still grappling with whether to prosecute the white officer seen on a widely watched video wrapping his arm around Garnerâ€™s neck.\nThe legal limbo is playing out on the watch of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who has come under persistent pressure in the city and elsewhere to bring Officer Daniel Pantaleo to justice. The New York City case turned out to be a forerunner to a series of videotaped police killings across the country that have fueled outrage and protests.\nBefore becoming attorney general, Lynch ran the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office in Brooklyn, which initiated the review of Garnerâ€™s case after a state grand jury refused to indict Pantaleo in 2014, and she personally met with Garnerâ€™s family in that role. Questioned by Congress this week, she said the Garner investigation remains open but gave no indication of how or when a decision will be made.\nLast year, the city agreed to pay $5.9 million to settle the familyâ€™s wrongful death claim, but the push for a federal case has persisted. Garnerâ€™s siblings performed on a rap song called â€œI Canâ€™t Breatheâ€? that was released to mark the second anniversary of his July 17, 2014, death, and his mother, Gwen Carr, has proposed converting a small park across the street from where he died into a playground named after him.\nâ€œWhatâ€™s in my heart is to keep my sonâ€™s name alive,â€? Carr said. â€œThis is my work for the rest of my life.â€?\n___\nWorld leaders voice support for Turkey, condemn coup\nWorld leaders expressed support for Turkey and its democratic institutions on Saturday after the government quashed an attempted military coup.\nITALY\nItalian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said Turkish authorities must do their utmost to ensure â€œrespect for the rule of law, of fundamental rights and of parliamentâ€™s roleâ€? following the failed military coup.\nIn a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry Saturday evening, Gentiloni expressed â€œreliefâ€? that Turkey thwarted what he calls a â€œmilitary adventure that would have brought the country into chaos with the return of ghosts of the past.â€?\nGentiloni also said that, â€œprompt re-establishment of constitutional order and stability is urgent and necessaryâ€? but that must occur without â€œindulging in the logic of violence.â€?\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Thousands of military officers, soldiers and other suspects linked to a failed coup in Turkey have been arrested, authorities said Sunday, amid signs that the campaign against the alleged plotters was turning into a crackdown on President Recep Tayyip Erdoganâ€™s opponents.\nThe countryâ€™s justice minister said that as many as 6,000 people had been detained by early Sunday.\nAmong those arrested was the commander at Incirlik Air Base, which is used by U.S. forces to launch raids against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, a senior Turkish official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was detained along with 10 other soldiers Sunday. The facility is a major installation of the North American Treaty Organization hosting U.S. forces that control a stockpile of nuclear weapons.\nThe U.S. consulate in the southern Turkish city of Adana said Saturday that authorities had cut power to Incirlik and blocked movement to and from the facility. Turkey also closed its airspace to military aircraft. But the Pentagon said Sunday that the countryâ€™s airspace had opened again and that all anti-Islamic State operations had resumed.\nâ€œU.S. facilities at Incirlik are still operating on internal power sources, but we hope to restore commercial power soon. Base operations have not been affected,â€? the Pentagonâ€™s press secretary, Peter Cook, said in a statement.\n1 of 63\nThe scene in Turkey after an attempted coup\nView Photos\nThe nationâ€™s military tried to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nCaption\nThe nationâ€™s military tried to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n?July 17, 2016 Women mourn near the flag-draped coffin of a relative in Istanbul, during the funeral of seven victims of the July 15 coup attempt. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n[ On the streets of Istanbul, anger, joy, devastation and celebration ]\nAs many as 3,000 soldiers ? including senior commanders in the Turkish armed forces ? have been seized by authorities in response to the unrest, which killed at least 265 people and rattled the stability of a key Middle Eastern nation and important U.S. ally.\nâ€œWhat we saw appears to show serious fracturing in Turkeyâ€™s military,â€? said Soner Cagaptay, director of Turkish research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. â€œThis is the second-largest military of NATO, an ally of the U.S. that borders Iran, Iraq, Syria, Russia and the Islamic State. And the last thing Washington wants is to see such an influential NATO memberâ€™s military fracture.â€?\nThe arrest of so many soldiers suggests that a significant number of Turkeyâ€™s armed forces personnel took part in the attempted overthrow.\nSome of the most senior military figures arrested in the coup plot include Gen. Akin Ozturk, a former commander of the Turkish air force and military attache to Israel who is a member of the Supreme Military Council.\nAnother is Gen. Adem Huduti, commander of the Second Army, which protects Turkeyâ€™s borders with Syria, Iraq and Iran. And Rear Adm. Hakan Ustem, commander of Turkish Coast Guard, was removed from his post, a senior Turkish official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the subject. It is unclear whether Ustem has been arrested.\nArrest warrants have also been issued for at least 2,745 judges and prosecutors across the country, according to Turkish media reports.\nRogue officers of Turkeyâ€™s military declared martial law and attempted to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan overnight, but Erdogan a few hours later said his government is in control. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\nErdogan seems to have been emboldened after overcoming the biggest challenge to his 13-year rule, with thousands of supporters taking to the streets in Istanbul and other areas of the country in defiance of the rogue soldiers who hatched an elaborate plot to overthrow the government.\nThe Turkish leader has alarmed many here over his attempts to consolidate power over the years. Some Turks have expressed concern that Erdogan will use Fridayâ€™s incident to further marginalize all forms of challenge to his growing powers, whether peaceful or not, even as the country struggles with myriad crises, including unrest from its large minority of Kurdish citizens and spillover from the civil war in neighboring Syria.\nNearly 3 million war-weary Syrians have taken refuge in Turkey, a country of 75 million people.\nA series of recent attacks linked to the Islamic State and Kurdish separatists have killed hundreds of people and badly damaged the Turkish economy.\nBy Saturday, authorities appeared to have neutralized the last threats from the attempted coup, but it was a greatly diminished Turkey that emerged from the chaos of the night before.\nTurkish officials say that the mastermind of Fridayâ€™s failed plot is Fetullah Gulen, an estranged friend of Erdoganâ€™s and a popular religious cleric who lives in the United States. Gulen has denied any connection to the plot.\nAnalysts say that Gulen has many supporters who have deeply penetrated Turkeyâ€™s police and judiciary but that he holds minimal support in the military.\nErdogan on Sunday attended a mass funeral in Istanbul for five people killed in the unrest. Other senior officials in attendance included Abdullah Gul, a former president, and Ahmet Davutoglu, a former prime minister.\nDuring the services, held at Istanbulâ€™s Fatih Mosque, Erdogan again spoke of Gulen as a central figure in the plot.\nThe throngs of people in attendance had angry words about Gulen, even calling for his death.\nâ€œWe want execution!â€? someone in the crowd yelled.\nErdogan, however, urged restraint.\nâ€œIf they have guns and tanks, we have faith,â€? he told the mourners. â€œSo let us think before taking each step.

Authorities said one officer is in critical condition. Mayor Kip Holden told NBC that the officers were responding to a call of shots fired when they were ambushed by at least one gunman. (Reuters)\nThree police officers were killed and three others injured in a shooting Sunday morning in Baton Rouge, authorities said.\nWhile police offered few immediate details about the exact origins of the incident, they say the violent incident unfolded early Sunday when?officers?responded to reports of a man carrying a rifle in an area filled with grocery stores and other businesses.\nCol.?Michael D. Edmonson of the Louisiana State Police, the agency taking the lead on the investigation, stressed Sunday afternoon that there was no active shooting situation and that police had killed the armed?attacker, who died during a shootout with officers.\nThe attacker in Baton Rouge was identified Sunday afternoon as?Gavin Long, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation. Authorities are exploring whether more than one person may have played a role in the incident, according to both officials, who asked not to be identified discussing an ongoing investigation.?Sunday was longâ€™s 29th birthday, according to one official.\nTwo of the officers fatally shot were with the Baton Rouge police force, while the third was part of the East Baton Rouge Sheriffâ€™s Office. Another deputy was?in critical condition after the shooting, Edmonson said at a briefing.\nâ€œAn attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,â€??Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) said at the same?news conference.\nIn the hours after the shooting, police had warned people to stay inside as they said they sought two other potential suspects. During an afternoon briefing, authorities said the?lone attacker was dead, though they still asked people to remain away from the area where the shooting occurred.\nSpecific details?about the shooting and the attacker remained unclear on Sunday, as officials did not say whether?they believe the officers were specifically targeted or ambushed in some way.?The shooting?happened in a region still on edge after police fatally shot a man there, sparking heated protests that prompted a heavy law enforcement response that some have questioned as unnecessarily?forceful.\nEdmonson said Sunday that officers were contacted about a man â€œcarrying a weapon, carrying a rifleâ€? at about 8:40 a.m. Police at a convenience store in the area saw the man, who was wearing all?black, Edmonson said.\nChaotic moments ensued. Edmonson said shots were reported fired at 8:42 a.m., and at 8:44 a.m., officers were reported down. At 8:45 a.m., more shots were fired. At 8:46, Edmonson said the suspect was reported near a car wash next to a convenience store. At 8:48 a.m., as emergency personnel began staging to treat the wounded, officers engaged the suspect and brought him down, Edmonson said.\nâ€œThis has happened far too often,â€? President Obama said in remarks at?the White House on Sunday afternoon. â€œIâ€™ve spent a lot of time with law enforcement this past week. Iâ€™m surrounded by the best every single day. And I know whenever this happens, wherever this happens, you feel it.â€?\n[ In May, Louisiana became the first state to make it a hate crime to target police ]\nThe East Baton Rouge Sheriff said one of his deputies was slain ? a 45-year-old ? and two were wounded ? a 41-year-old and a 51-year-old. The 41-year-old, he said, was in critical condition. The Baton Rouge police chief said two of his officers were killed ? a 41-year-old with just under a year of service and a 32-year-old with 10 years of service. A 41-year-old Baton Rouge Police Officer with 9 years of service was also shot and wounded, the chief said.\nBaton Rouge Mayor Kip Holden said he had spoken to officials from the White House, who offered to assist in any way possible.\nâ€œItâ€™s touched, basically, people all across the country,â€??he told WAFB in?a telephone interview just after noon. â€œIf this is not a defining moment for us, to bridge the divide and come out with a unified voice, than I donâ€™t know what is.â€?\nIn a statement, Baton Rouge said that its police force and other local, state and federal authorities were â€œactively investigating the circumstances surrounding this morningâ€™s shooting.â€?\nAgents for the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene in Baton Rouge responding to the shooting, according to Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. She?said?in a statement that â€œthere is no place in the United States for such appalling violenceâ€? and strongly condemned the shooting.\nA?spokesman for the FBI in New Orleans said he was â€œunsureâ€? whether the officers were targeted?or what?might have sparked the incident. He declined to comment further.\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he wished he had the words to describe his heartbreak after at least three police officers were killed and several injured in Baton Rouge on July 17. Authorities said the active shooter situation is over and one shooter is dead. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)\nBut the shooting deaths came during a particularly deadly year for law enforcement, and not long after a gunman who said he was enraged by police killings targeted police in Dallas.\nâ€œWhen a police officer is shot or assaulted, it makes every single citizen in the country a little less safe,â€? said Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, the countryâ€™s largest police union. â€œWhen police officers have to worry about citizens committing unprovoked acts of violence against them it makes it more difficult for them to interact with citizens and that is a key factor in law enforcement.â€?\nThe three deaths Sunday in Baton Rouge brought the total number of officers killed in the line of duty to 30 so far this year ? up from about 16 at this point last year. The average mid-year total, according to FBI data, is about 25. The tally this year has spiked significantly in recent days from three incidents just in recent days:?Two?bailiffs, both deputized by the sheriff there,?were killed in a Michigan courthouse last week , not long after five police officers were fatally shot in Dallas.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with Baton Rouge Police. @BRPD #PrayforBatonRouge\n? Chief David O. Brown (@DPDChief) July 17, 2016\nIn May, Edwards signed a â€œBlue Lives Matterâ€? bill into law, making Louisiana the first state in the country where police officers, firefighters and other first responders are a protected class under hate-crime law. Edwards, the son of a sheriff, said that this was needed because these people â€œput their lives on the line every day, often under very dangerous circumstancesâ€? and deserve this protection.\nNo other state includes police officers as a protected class under hate-crime laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But at least 37 states ? including Louisiana ? have enhanced penalties for assaulting police officers. In?some states, hurting a police officer can be an â€œaggravating factorâ€? to an assault or battery charge. Meanwhile, killing a police officer can also be an aggravating factor or circumstance in many states to make a crime eligible for the death penalty.\nâ€œI condemn, in the strongest sense of the word, the attack on law enforcement in Baton Rouge,â€? President Obama said in a statement Sunday afternoon . â€œFor the second time in two weeks, police officers who put their lives on the line for ours every day were doing their job when they were killed in a cowardly and reprehensible assault. These are attacks on public servants, on the rule of law, and on civilized society, and they have to stop.â€?\nObama said he had offered the federal governmentâ€™s full support to officials in Louisiana, vowing that â€œjustice will be done.â€?\n[ President Obama sharply condemns shooting ]\nObama noted that it was unclear yet what may have motivated the shooting, he emphatically called it?â€œthe work of cowards who speak for no one.â€? Obama has been criticized in the past for his statements about police, which some commentators and politicians have described as too critical of law enforcement.\nLast week, at a town hall meeting on race and policing , Obama was confronted by one such critic ? Texas?Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R), who has called Obamaâ€™s rhetoric on the issue â€œdivisive. Obama rejected the suggestion?that he had not been supportive enough of police and said he has?been â€œunequivocal in condemning any rhetoric directed at police officers.â€?\nObama spoke with Edwards and Holden on Sunday and?offered?condolences to the families of the officers killed, according to the White House. He also asked to be updated throughout the day about the shooting.\nThe FBI New Orleans Division sent personnel to the scene to assist.\nâ€œAt this time, our focus is to help identify and bring to justice those who are responsible for this heinous act,â€? a spokesman said.\nIn a video sent
 to WAFB by someone who said she?witnessed the shooting, a woman is heard saying that she saw a man with â€œa mask on looking like a ninja.â€? The woman, sounding panicked, said: â€œHeâ€™s about to start popping again. Oh my God!â€?\nAnother local woman told The Post that she was playing tennis with her two daughters and her husband when their game was interrupted by gunfire.\nThe woman, who asked to have her name withheld, was in a park about a mile from the shooting, one she chose because she thought it was located a safe distance from recent unrest. It was a beautiful morning, she said, until the gunfire erupted.\nâ€œIt sounded like a shootout. After many rounds, we started to hear sirens and saw a police car driving fast down Drusilla Lane and then we got out of there,â€? she said. She added: â€œI feel trapped in our own home. I canâ€™t take my kids out and I thought we would be safe here because we are close to a police station.â€?\nA helicopter and police cars respond to an active shooter situation at in Baton Rouge. At least 3 officer were killed. (Marquis Gibson)\nCell phone video allegedly taken as the shooting unfolded and aired by CBS affiliate WAFB shows police vehicles descending on a gas station while gunfire echoes in the background.\nReached by phone, Justin Alford, the owner of the B-Quick Convenience Store on Airline Highway, said he couldnâ€™t comment about the incident at this time.\nâ€œPlease pray for us,â€? he said. When asked if he would be able to speak more about the incident later, he said, â€œIâ€™m not sure. Itâ€™s a sad situation.â€?\nLocal reports said that police had sent a robot in the store after the gunfire to check for explosives, but Alford said he could not confirm that.\nPresident Obama called for unity nationwide following a July 17 shooting in Baton Rouge that left three police officers dead and three others injured. (Reuters)\nMark Clements, who lives two blocks behind the nearby Hammond Aire shopping plaza, said he heard 10 to 12 gunshots coming from that direction around 8:40 a.m. He was letting his dogs out in his backyard when he heard the gunfire, followed by sirens and helicopters.\nHis neighborhood, known as Tara, has been feeling the tension over police shootings since officers fatally shot?Alton Sterling earlier this month outside a convenience store.\nSterlingâ€™s death, partially captured in videos from the scene that were widely viewed on social media and television, prompted intense protests that stretched for days in Baton Rouge. A day after Sterling was killed, a Minnesota man was fatally shot during a traffic stop, and the following day the gunman in Dallas killed five officers and wounded nine others.\nLots of cops staged in Hammond Aire shopping plaza. Details sketchy. pic.twitter.com/ZdbmDT6sjJ\n? Charles Lussier (@Charles_Lussier) July 17, 2016\nAt least 15 people have been demonstrating outside the Baton Rouge police headquarters at most times, Clements said. The largest protest occurred on on July 9, when people lined Airport Highway for a quarter of a mile, carrying signs, singing and chanting. During the protests in the city, more than 100 people were arrested, and demonstrators?and activist groups have questioned the aggressive response from police.\nIn Baton Rouge, police said earlier this week that they responded in that way?to protests because they had received a threat to law enforcement officials in the city.?According to police, a teenager accused accused of stealing guns during a burglary told investigators that he and others involved were seeking bullets to shoot officers. Police officials?said that they felt this threat was credible enough that it shaped their response to protests.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have sued the Baton Rouge police and the East Baton Rouge Sheriffâ€™s Office for their response to protests, accusing law enforcement officials of using excessive force during the demonstrations.\nâ€œWhat you saw in the response was because of the very real and viable threats against law enforcement,â€? East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff Sid J. Gautreaux III said last week. â€œAll I can say beyond that is look what happened in Dallas ? a very peaceful protest and then some crazy madman did what he did.â€?\n[ Cleveland police union calls for ban on open carry as fears of violence mount ahead of GOP convention ]\nThe shooting Sunday illustrated the dangers facing police officers, said?Mark Lomax, executive director?of the National Tactical Officers Association, pointing to the Dallas attacks that authorities there had attributed to a lone gunman acting as a sort of sniper.\nâ€œCommunities and legislators say we donâ€™t want our police to look like warriors, we want them to look like peacekeepers,â€? Lomax said. â€œBut one element of war is being attacked by snipers. Now they are going to have to be properly equipped and trained to deal with this.\nEarlier Sunday, a police officer in Milwaukee was shot multiple times while sitting in his squad car. The officer was on the cityâ€™s south side for an investigation into possible domestic violence, and Milwaukee police say the suspect in two incidents of domestic violence that brought officers to the area walked up to the car and began firing.\nThe Milwaukee officer was taken to a hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries, and the suspect was found dead after apparently taking his own life not far from the shooting.\nIn the hours?after the shooting in Baton Rouge, dozens of people gathered outside the ambulance entrance at?Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center.

The consequences will ripple for days and weeks to come, the most recent being a massive crackdown on suspected plotters. The Post reports :\nThe countryâ€™s justice minister said that as many as 6,000 people had been detained by early Sunday.\nAmong those arrested was the commander at Incirlik Air Base, which is used by U.S. forces to launch raids against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, a senior Turkish official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was detained along with 10 other soldiers on Sunday. . . .?As many as 3,000 soldiers ? including senior commanders in the Turkish armed forces ? have been seized by authorities in response to the unrest, which killed at least 265 people and rattled the stability of a key Middle Eastern nation and important U.S. ally.\nThe failed coup is a troubling development for U.S. intelligence, for Turkeyâ€™s diminishing civil liberties and for the war against Islamic terrorism. Letâ€™s take each in order.\nâ€œWe did not see this coming, which is disconcerting on two levels,â€? says foreign-policy expert Jonathan Schanzer of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. â€œWe need to have a better grasp on whatâ€™s happening with this country that is so crucial to U.S. interests . . . [and] if we canâ€™t predict a coup attempt in Turkey, can we determine if Iran cheats on the [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]? This raises troubling questions about our intelligence in the region.â€?\nMoreover, the failure to anticipate events goes to our lack of adeptness at handling Erdogan, once President Obamaâ€™s favorite world leader. Former ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman tells me, â€œThe reason people didnâ€™t see it coming is that Erdogan has been so successful at turning things to his advantage (like the elections last year) that people had stopped thinking about the potential downside risks. The military had clearly been broken as an institution by the various conspiracy trials and jailings of general/flag officers (over 100 in jail at one point).â€? The lack of a coherent policy toward Turkey is a bipartisan failure. â€œIn general, in both the Bush and Obama Administrations we have tended to turn a blind eye to the negative trajectory of domestic developments in Turkey ?because we have seen the country as â€˜too important to failâ€™ for other reasons ? Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, etc. ?I think that has been a mistake.â€? In the wake of the coup, we can expect a stronger crackdown, as well as?intensified resentment toward the government. Schanzer explains, â€œThe quashing of this coup will put more power in the hands of an already autocratic Erdogan. This is not good, if we seek to have any leverage over the Turkish president.â€?\nAs he often does when things go wrong, Erdogan is choosing to blame Fethullah Gulen, a moderate cleric who had a falling out with Erdogan and retired to Pennsylvania, whom his defenders call the â€œdefault scapegoat.â€? Gulen has denounced the coup.\nThe failure of the United States to destroy the Islamic State has of course put immense pressure on Turkey, which among other things has been forced to absorb about 2.7 million refugees pouring out of Syria. The failed coup in turn will make defeating the Islamic State even tougher. Edelman points to two dangers. First, â€œTurkey will be domestically preoccupied as Erdogan tries to use this to cement his personalized rule and therefore will be inclined to devote fewer resources to the anti-ISIL fight, and its military is likely to be disabled, as are the police (which had a strong Gulenist presence), and therefore will be less capable of prosecuting the fight against ISIL.â€? Moreover, Edelman worries that Erdogan â€œmay face the temptation of holding Incirlik [Air Base] hostage to our willingness to extradite Fethullah Gulen to Turkey (forget the fact that he fled the country because the military was trying to put him in jail for wanting to overthrow the Turkish State).â€? Though?Turkey is an ally, sending Gulen back without solid evidence of real complicity would ?be disgraceful.\nDonald Trump wildly blamed Hillary Clinton for the coup. The germ of truth there is that the Obama administration ? like the Bush team ? has not shown effective leadership in pushing Turkey toward domestic reforms. Moreover, the halfhearted effort to defeat the Islamic State puts many allies ? not just Turkey ? at risk. (Obamaâ€™s appeasement of Russia and Iran makes it likely that either or both of those countries would look to capitalize on destabilization of Turkey.) However, as with so many issues, Trump would make things far worse. His love affair with dictators would encourage Erdogan down the destructive path heâ€™s been on. Trumpâ€™s preference for pulling back from?NATO only serves to rattle allies and send them searching for more reliable partners. And of course Trump has no plan for winning the war against the Islamic State, vaguely claiming heâ€™s going to win it with the most amazing intelligence, or something.\nThis is yet one more example of the fragile condition of U.S. allies, the instability across Africa and the Middle East caused by the metastasizing threat from jihadist radicals, and the reverberations in the region from a weak U.S. presence.

(Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\nWhat is worse than an ever-more-authoritarian regime that constantly aims to crush a robust civil society? The answe emerged bluntly in Turkey on Friday night: to have your army pointing its guns at you. To have your army bombing the parliament building. To have a military takeover.\nTurkey has experienced its share of coups dâ€™etat since the 1960s, and the nation knows very well the atrocities that follow such an intervention, and the damage it causes to democratic structure. But we have never seen anything like this past weekâ€™s coup attempt: It did not bear any of the hallmarks of previous military attempts to seize power.\nThere is a saying in Turkey: â€œto wake up to the noise of an army tank,â€? referring to a midnight military takeover. This latest attempt, though, began on a Friday during rush hour, with jets flying low in Ankara and gendarmerie closing down the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul. It did not seem to be planned thoroughly from the start, as communication continued to flow through social media and broadcast television.\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan made several appearances on TV and called the nation to take to the street to defend democracy ? however ironic that was, in light of his tendencies toward authoritarian rule. The condemnation of the coup attempt was unanimous in the public; main opposition parties gathered at the parliament to show solidarity against the putsch. One prominent public intellectual, Murat Belge, who had backed Erdoganâ€™s party initially but became a critic after the presidentâ€™s shift toward palpable authoritarianism, wrote , â€œEven though I do not agree with the AKP supporters on the streets on many topics in life, what they did was a very important and positive action.â€? Journalist Hasan Cemal, a fervent opponent of Erdoganâ€™s illiberal policies, underlined his years-old slogan , â€œSoldier! Take your hands off the politics,â€? a day after the coup attempt.\n[ Turkey has had a lot of coup attempts. Hereâ€™s why this one failed. ]\nThe coup attempt, and the resistance to it, played out using modern technology. The perpetrators formed a Whatsapp group called â€œPeace At Homeâ€? (they also called themselves the â€œPeace At Home Councilâ€?) and managed the coup through messages, according to Turkeyâ€™s state-run news outlet Anadolu Agency. On the other side, government officials used SMS messages and social media to call people out to the street to resist the military. Erdogan and former president Abdullah Gul and spoke on live TV through FaceTime. All that played a crucial role in putting the coup down.\nTo see Erdogan and the AKP using social media to rally Turks to protect democracy was bitterly ironic. Blocking and/or slowing down the Internet and imposing a broadcast ban on TV are the main methods Erdoganâ€™s administration has come to use during major news events. That was what the government did, for example, after a mine explosion in Soma in 2014 and attacks by the Islamic State last year in Suruc and Ankara, and earlier this summer in Istanbul. The Dogan Media news outlets, whose live broadcast Erdogan joined via FaceTime, have been blacklisted by the AKP , and its executives and journalists have been called â€œtraitorsâ€? countless times and persecuted through various methods including ad revenue cuts, smear campaigns and tax fines.\nErdogan and senior Turkish government officials blamed the coup on the Gulen movement ? an Islamic network whose leader, Fethullah Gulen , has been in exile in Pennsylvania since 1999 and has feuded with Erdogan since 2014, when prosecutors close to Gulen attempted to arrest Hakan Fidan, the head of the national intelligence agency, because of his involvement in a secret negotiation with the outlawed PKK. Both the president and the exiled cleric had risen from different ideologies of Islam, but they had united in 2007 in an alliance against Kemalist elites, especially in the military. A series of sham trials known as Ergenekon and Balyoz (Sledgehammer) followed, purging the military of many adherents of Kemalism , the secular ideology espoused by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish republic. But once the military was weakened, and ceased to be an obstacle for Erdoganâ€™s regime, a power struggle between the Gulen movement and the AKP followed.\nErdogan ordered detention of disciples of Gulen in the media, police force, judiciary and private sector. Allegedly, the spree of arrests that targeted judges and military officers after the coup attempt was planned long before . Seen in that light, the failed coup, which looked like a kamikaze attack rather than a thoroughly planned military takeover, may instead have been an attempt to head off those arrests in a preemptive strike. One of the alleged masterminds of the coup, Gen. Ak?n ?ztÃ¼rk of the air force, was appointed by the AKP after his predecessor had been sacked during the Sledgehammer trial.\n[ How Turkey uses terrorism to justify its crackdown on the press ]\nSo the coup attempt bears lessons for everyone who overlooked the importance of a robust civil society, separation of powers and freedom of expression. It also shows that the draconian state the AKP had built is actually very fragile. Erdoganâ€™s government didnâ€™t replace the previous elite with sound constitutional changes and democratic reforms; it only transferred power from Kemalists to their own followers.\nOnce his loyalists were back in control of the country this weekend, Erdogan called the coup attempt an opportunity sent from God to cleanse the state of the Gulenists, and said that July 15 should be celebrated as the triumph of democracy. But it would be na?ve to expect that any democracy would come out of this appalling incident in the short term. Everything Erdogan has done up to now, and everything he has done in the days after the coup ? 6,000 people have been arrested since Friday ? shows that he would prefer to maximize his power rather than promote democracy. And it is uncertain which way this obvious rift in the military will evolve. It is too soon to claim that soldiers will never again try to take power after Friday night; everyone believed until last week that Erdogan had rendered a coup impossible, and yet, the attempt was made anyway.\nFinally, the lingering tension in the country has alarming traits. Unnervingly, the mosques and Erdogan himself are making unending calls to stay on the streets to â€œprotect democracy,â€? and certain Islamic groups are going to districts mostly inhabited by Alawites, a minority Muslim group, shouting slogans. The same Islamist wave may well start targeting all other segments of the society that it considers infidels, emboldened by the defeat of the coup attempt. Unfortunately, just like coups dâ€™etat, Turkey has been the scene of many pogroms in the past, such as the 1993 massacre of mostly Alawite intellectuals in a hotel in Sivas.\nPeople on the streets are to be congratulated for their resistance to the military takeover, but caution is warranted: There is a difference between protesting the army and asking for democratic reforms, and calling the crowd on the streets itself an army, with Erdogan the commander, as in one of the slogans that was frequently chanted Friday night: â€œ??te Ordu ??te Komutanâ€? (Here is the army, here is the commander). History dictates that it is highly unlikely that the latter would bring us the liberal democracy Turkey still longs for.\n6\n	washingtonpost	World

Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Sunday that the failed coup in Turkey has created only minor delays in the military campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and that it will not diminish Turkeyâ€™s role in the fight.\nKerry, who talked by phone three separate times Saturday with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, told CNN he was assured that the continuing turmoil will not interrupt ?counterterrorism efforts based in Turkey. Missions against the Islamic State are flown out of Incirlik Air Base, near the southern Turkish city of Adana. Air space was closed Saturday after the coup attempt but was reopened Sunday. Kerry said he expected that operations would return to normal â€œvery quickly.â€?\nâ€œAccording to our commanders, there may have been a minor delay here or there or something, but it has not affected the fundamental direction or commitment to the fight,â€? Kerry said on CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Union,â€? in the first of three pretaped interviews he gave in Luxembourg to the Sunday morning talk shows.\nThe attempted coup has exacerbated tensions between the United States and Turkey, a fellow member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Relations improved, though, after Turkey tightened its border in response to U.S. complaints to stop Islamic State fighters from crossing into the country and to keep foreign fighters from entering Syria. But since the attempted coup, Kerry has publicly, and in conversations with Cavusoglu, urged Turkey to uphold democratic principles even as it investigates the coup plotters and detains thousands of suspects.\nâ€œObviously, there are coup plotters, and the coup plotters need to be held accountable, and they will be,â€? Kerry told â€œThis Weekâ€? host George Stephanopoulos in an interview on ABC. â€œBut I think weâ€™re all concerned, and we have expressed that concern, that this not fuel a reach well beyond those who engaged in the coup but that they strengthen the democracy of the country, strengthen the process and use it as a moment to unite the nation.â€?\nKerry also has pushed back against senior Turkish officials who alleged that the United States may have played a role in the failed coup and who demanded the extradition of Fethullah ?Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania they accused of staging the attempted coup. On Saturday, Kerry said the United States was open to the idea of extraditing Gulen, but he said Turkey must first provide evidence that meets U.S. legal standards.\nâ€œThey also have to make a formal request for extradition through the judicial process. They havenâ€™t done that yet,â€? he said in an interview on NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press.â€? â€œAnd that has to be accompanied by evidence and by demonstrated facts, which would lead a court to approve the extradition itself. Weâ€™re not blocking it. Weâ€™ve never had a formal request.â€?\nDespite the edge in the rhetoric between Washington and Ankara, Kerry said on â€œThis Weekâ€? that Turkish officials have assured the United States that they will continue to take part in the campaign against militants in bordering Syria. He attributed the temporary closing of Incirlik to the discovery that some aircraft used in the attempted coup had refueled at the base.\nâ€œBut theyâ€™ve assured us, and to date we donâ€™t see a negative drag on the effort with respect to ?counter ISIL,â€? Kerry said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.\nKerry repeatedly said that the fight against the Islamic State is making progress on the battlefield. He tied the attacks in the West, including one last week in the French city of Nice, to the success in taking back territory from the militants in Syria and Iraq.\nâ€œThey are on the run,â€? he said on CNN. â€œAnd I believe what weâ€™re seeing are the desperate actions of an entity that sees the noose closing around them.â€?\nFridayâ€™s attempted coup, which started unfolding as Kerry was wrapping up talks with Russian officials in Moscow, has preoccupied him during his two-day stop in Luxembourg.\nIn a quiet, reflective moment before departing for Brussels, Kerry paid his respects at the Luxembourg American Cemetery where more than 5,000 U.S. service members from World War II are buried, including Gen. George S. Patton. Most of the dead lost their lives in the Battle of the Bulge and in the advance to the Rhine River. There is only one woman, a nurse, buried at the cemetery.\nKerry and Luxembourgâ€™s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, laid roses at the memorial site that has been erected before a field of white crosses and Stars of David for servicemen who died between the end of 1944 and 1945. Kerry also laid a white rose and a State Department commemorative coin at each of the graves of two brothers from Massachusetts who are buried side by side.\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

The Latest on the attempted military coup in Turkey (all times local):\n12:25 p.m.\nThe European Union commissioner negotiating with Turkey on its accession bid believes the Turkish government is exploiting the failed coup to target internal opponents.\nJohannes Hahn said Monday it appears Turkeyâ€™s government â€œpreparedâ€? arrest lists before the weekend coup attempt and had been waiting for the right moment.\nHahn said of the governmentâ€™s post-coup response: â€œIt is exactly what we feared.â€? He spoke before a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.\nTurkey has detained some 6,000 people. They include hundreds of judges and prosecutors, and more than two dozen generals.\n___\n12:20 p.m.\nTurkeyâ€™s state-run news agency says the Interior Ministry has sacked close to 9,000 personnel across the country, following Fridayâ€™s foiled coup attempt. Anadolu Agency says a total of 8,777 employees attached to the ministry were dismissed, including 30 governors, 52 civil service inspectors and 16 legal advisers.\nOther media reports said police and military police officers and coast guards were also removed from duty. The government has blamed the failed coup ? which led to at least 294 deaths and wounded 1,400 others ? on supporters of a U.S.-based Muslim cleric who has become President Recep Tayyip Erdoganâ€™s chief opponent.\n___\n12:15 p.m.\nTurkeyâ€™s state-run news agency says prosecutors have begun questioning 27 generals and admirals over the failed coup attempt.\nThe Anadolu Agency says Monday the group questioned by prosecutors in Ankara includes former Air Force commander Gen. Akin Ozturk, who has been described as the ringleader of the foiled uprising.\nOzturk, who remained in active duty, has denied he was involved and insisted he worked to quell the uprising in statements he made to Turkish media.\n___\n11:00 a.m.\nEight Turkish military personnel who landed in Greece in a helicopter during a military coup in Turkey are to appear in court in the northern Greek city of Alexandroupolis, charged with illegally entering the country.\nThey are likely to request a one- or two-day postponement during Mondayâ€™s court appearance. Turkey is seeking their return, and all eight have requested asylum in Greece.\nThe eight landed in Alexandroupolis Saturday after issuing a distress call and requesting permission for an emergency landing. Their lawyer, Vassiliki Ilia Marinaki, has said her clients say they knew nothing about the coup and that the helicopter had been used to transport wounded. They say that shortly after finding out about the coup, they came under fire from the police and feared for their lives.\n___\n10:20 a.m.\nSaudi-owned broadcaster Al-Arabiya says Saudi authorities detained Turkeyâ€™s military attache to Kuwait while he was at the airport in the eastern Saudi city of Dammam.\nQuoting unnamed sources, the Dubai-based broadcaster said Monday that the attache, Mikail Ihsanoglu, was on his way to DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany via Amsterdam when he was detained.\nThe official Saudi Press Agency meanwhile reported that Saudi King Salman, who is vacationing in Morocco, called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to â€œcongratulate him on Turkeyâ€™s return to normalityâ€? after an attempted military coup.\n___\n9:45 a.m.\nThe European Unionâ€™s foreign policy chief says foreign ministers on Monday will send a â€œstrong messageâ€? that the rule of law and the democratic system of checks and balances must be respected in Turkey following the failure of a military putsch.\nFederica Mogherini, the EUâ€™s high representative for foreign affairs, spoke before a meeting of the blocâ€™s foreign affairs ministers in Brussels.

At the Dogan Media Center, a sleek glass building here that houses some of Turkeyâ€™s major media outlets, the failed coup arrived just before dawn Saturday with the low drone of a Black Hawk helicopter setting down in a nearby parking lot.\nMinutes later, 14 soldiers led by a small cadre of officers entered the building and quickly split into two smaller groups to take over various news channels and publications, including the Hurriyet Daily News and the television stations CNN Turk and Kanal D.\nThe soldiers had one demand: Stop publishing or broadcasting. Other than that, they said little. The cameras kept rolling, how?ever, as newsroom staff members pulled out their smartphones and the producers put up a ticker that read, â€œSoldiers have entered CNN Turk studios.â€?\nIf the coup plottersâ€™ intention was to silence a handful of critical media in one fell swoop, they failed spectacularly. Dispatching only a handful of men to seize four newsrooms was inadequate, and it led the outlets to resist ? albeit while forcing them into the awkward position of defending Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has repeatedly attacked them and their colleagues around the country.\nYet despite a moment of seemingly mutual understanding between Erdogan and the independent Turkish media ? best captured in a surreal moment when an Ankara bureau chief for CNN Turk let Erdogan FaceTime his nation in the throes of the coup dâ€™etat ? some Turkish journalists are wary about what the unrest will entail for their profession and ultimately their country.\nMembers of Turkey's military have overrun the offices of several major media organizations, including CNN Turk, which went off air. Turkeyâ€™s military launched a coup against the elected government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan setting off a violent struggle between the nationâ€™s military and civilian leaders. (CNN Turk)\n[ Turkey detains 6,000 linked to failed coup ]\nMurat Yetkin, editor in chief of the Hurriyet Daily News, was at his desk when seven soldiers burst into the buildingâ€™s atrium Saturday morning, pointed rifles at journalists and told them to â€œstop their work and get out.â€?\nOutside the media center, Yetkin couldnâ€™t help noticing that a growing crowd of anti-coup protesters contained many of the same faces from an incident in September when armed throngs who backed Erdogan had attacked his newsroom with molotov cocktails because of its reporting on Erdogan and his government.\nâ€œThereâ€™s no reason to be optimistic about this situation,â€? Yetkin said. â€œBut you cannot correct bad with worse. We have a lot of problems, but thatâ€™s no reason to be supportive of a military coup.â€?\nCNN Turk, part of the Dogan Media group that owns the Hurriyet Daily News, also had a history of conflict with the Erdogan government. But journalists said that feud was put aside when soldiers stormed the building.\nâ€œI think we did the right thing; we gave a platform to the legitimate government of this country to address the people,â€? said Ferhat Boratav, editor in chief of CNN Turk.\nHe said that allowing Erdogan to call for people to come out and demonstrate was a â€œrisky thingâ€? but that it was a decisive factor in ending the coup.\nThe Dogan Media group is part of a conglomerate known as Dogan Holding, which has had several disputes with Erdoganâ€™s government.\nIn 2009, the conglomerate was fined $2.5?billion for unpaid taxes. Critics said the judgment was payback for the groupâ€™s coverage of corruption allegations against members of the presidentâ€™s inner circle.\nIn May 2015, Erdogan accused the owner, Aydin Dogan, of being a â€œcoup loverâ€? and labeled the groupâ€™s columnists â€œcharlatans.â€?\nDogan came to Erdoganâ€™s defense Sunday, criticizing the coup attempt in a statement published by the Hurriyet Daily News under the headline, â€œLetâ€™s defend democracy together.â€?\n[ On the streets of Istanbul, anger, joy, devastation and celebration ]\nDogan said the country had â€œsurvived a possible disaster with the solidarity of the state, the nation, politics and the media.â€?\nHe went on to say that people in Turkey, whatever their political differences, should defend democracy and come together as a nation.\nErdem Gul, Ankara bureau chief of the newspaper CumHurriyet, said that Erdogan is unlikely to thank his former critics for their support during the coup, and that its suppression probably will mean further restrictions on press freedom.\nâ€œThe government controls a big part of the media, and for those parts which it couldnâ€™t control, they are under the threat of imprisonment or being investigated,â€? Gul said in a phone interview.\nâ€œFor these reasons, there is a lot of concern that Turkey is now heading toward even more authoritarianism,â€? he said.\nIn May, Gul was sentenced to five years in prison for a report on Turkeyâ€™s attempt to ship arms to Islamist rebels fighting the Syrian government. A colleague, Can Dundar, received a similar sentence. Both journalists were acquitted of espionage charges, and their cases are being appealed.\nBut more than 30 other journalists are in prison, Gul said, and the Committee to Protect Journalists has said Turkey is one of the â€œworst jailers of journalists worldwide.â€?\nâ€œIn the aftermath of the attempted coup, we urge the Turkish government to allow journalists to report on news events freely and independently,â€? Nina Ognianova, program coordinator for CPJ Europe and Central Asia, said in a statement. â€œAnd to do its utmost to guarantee the safety and security of all journalists.â€?\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

Turkey announced on Wednesday plans to release about 38,000 inmates from overcrowded prisons as the penal system struggles to cope with a flood of new detainees after last monthâ€™s failed coup.\nThe eligible prisoners will be freed under judicial supervision similar to probation or parole. Those convicted of terrorism, murder, sexual assault and other violent crimes are excluded, officials said.\nâ€œThis measure is not an amnesty,â€? Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag posted Wednesday on Twitter.\n[ Turkeyâ€™s purge turns a former national hero into a fugitive ]\nThe move does not apply to those who committed crimes after July?1, officials said.

(Reuters)\nThe decree was published Wednesday morning in Turkeyâ€™s Official Gazette. The government gave no reason for the measure, and it was unclear when the prisoners would be released.\nTurkey enacted a three-month state of emergency on July?21, which allows the cabinet to rule by decree. The decrees must then be submitted to parliament but are not subject to review by the courts.\nLawmakers had anticipated this decree â€œbecause the prisons are very full. The prisons have reached a point where they could not be inhabited anymore,â€? said Sezgin Tanrikulu, Istanbul deputy for the opposition Republican Peopleâ€™s Party.\nRights groups have slammed Turkeyâ€™s government over inhumane prison conditions, particularly in the past month as authorities detained more than 35,000 people after the coup attempt. About 12,000 of them were subsequently released, but 18,000 others have been formally arrested, and the rest remain in detention without being charged.\nThe majority of those detained have been accused of links to U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan whom Turkey blames for the attempted coup. The crackdown has reached every sector in Turkey, including the army, security ?branches, universities, schools, hospitals and the media.\n[ In quest to punish coup plotters, Turkey squeezes out room for dissent ]\nTurkeyâ€™s prisons can accommodate about 180,000 inmates. But the facilities were already over capacity when the government embarked on its sweeping post-coup purge, according to the London-based Institute for Criminal Policy Research (ICPR), a think tank and prison watchdog.\nTurkeyâ€™s government announced in January that it would build 165 additional prisons to house the growing inmate population. In 2000, prisoners in Turkish jails numbered fewer than 50,000, according to ICPR.\nSince the failed putsch, in which rogue troops seized tanks and fighter jets in their attempt to overthrow the government, rights groups have documented horrific abuses? in Turkish detention centers, including sports facilities and courthouses. Judges and prosecutors also have been suspended, detained or arrested during the crackdown, creating a backlog in the courts and raising fears of minimal judicial oversight at a time of widespread repression.\nAmnesty International recently said that it had gathered â€œcredible evidence that detainees in Turkey are subjected to beatings and torture, including rape.â€?\nPolice in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, â€œare holding detainees in stress positions for up to 48 hours, denying them food, water and medical treatment,â€?

Warfare Worldwide (@WarfareWW) August 19, 2016\nThis is not the first time Tu-22s have made an appearance in?Russiaâ€™s air campaign over Syria. Before Tuesdayâ€™s strikes, the long-range bombers had launched from southern Russia, not Iran. Sleek, with a swing-wing design much like the U.S. B-1, the Tu-22 can hold a sizable amount of ordnance and?is considered a medium bomber.\nUsing Hamedan as a staging point for the bombers would allow them to carry more munitions into the fight. When flying from Russia, the aircraft would have to compensate for the longer range by loading up more fuel instead of more weapons and ammunition. By taking off or refueling?in Iran,?the?shorter distance between Hamedan and, say, eastern Syria, would allow the bombers to a carry a much larger payload, subsequently?giving them more time over their targets and the ability to strike more of them.\nWhile staging and refueling Tu-22s at Hamedan would make sense?Russiaâ€™s largest air base in Syria is too small to accommodate a detachment of the aircraft ? the enduring presence of the Su-34s in Iran is a little more confounding.\nA twin-seat, twin-engine multirole strike aircraft, the Su-34 has been flying from Russiaâ€™s Hmeimim airfield in Syria since 2015. The aircraft had only recently debuted in the Russian air force before its first combat sorties over?Syria, prompting the?Russian military to use?the war-torn country as a proving ground for the aircraftâ€™s?capabilities.\n[ Hereâ€™s what an advanced Russian tank looks like after getting hit with a U.S.-made missile ]\nFlying Su-34s into Syria from Hamedan would make little tactical sense, as they would need to hold more fuel than normal if they were taking off from within Syria.?Michael Kofman, an analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses who focuses on Russian military operations, said there are two likely reasons for deploying Su-34s from Iran. The first would be?to increase pressure on the United States to coordinate more closely with Russia; the second,?to?conduct?air operations over Iraq.\nStill,?the number of Su-34s at Hamedan is relatively small, and open-source satellite imagery has yet to show the foundation of any semi-permanent structures for the Russian aircraft and its associated maintenance crews, suggesting it might be too early to tell what Russiaâ€™s designs for the base might?entail.\nâ€œRight now, thereâ€™s nothing here to really get excited about,â€?

(Reuters)\nEarly on Thursday morning, the Indian army claims its special forces attacked â€œlaunchpadsâ€? used by militants to infiltrate across the Line of Control between the Indian and Pakistani administered areas of Jammu and Kashmir. Though it has made similar raids in the past, this is the first time the Indian government has openly acknowledged a raid across the LOC, both in public statements and in leaks to the media . Two Pakistan?army soldiers and an unknown number of militants were killed in what the Indian army referred to as â€œ surgical strikes .â€?\nThis is not the first time that India and Pakistan have clashed in Kashmir. Multiple past wars ? most recently the Kargil conflict in 1999 ? have been joined by regular skirmishes, cross-LOC artillery exchanges and raids, especially before?a cease-fire in 2003. Why, after a long period of relative calm, have we seen this new escalation?\nRetaliation for an earlier attack\nThe raid is clear retaliation for a Sept. 18 militant attack that killed 18 soldiers in an Indian army camp near Uri in Indian-administered Kashmir. Since the Uri attack, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s government has been seeking to put diplomatic pressure on Pakistan , ranging from condemning it at the United Nations to orchestrating a boycott of the SAARC summit to be held in Islamabad, to bringing up government human rights abuses in the Pakistani province of Balochistan.\nIndian commentators and politicians had been demanding a vigorous response, especially because the Uri attack was preceded by a similar attack against an Indian air force base at Pathankot in January 2016. Modiâ€™s government attempted an opening to Pakistanâ€™s civilian leaders, but the combination of Panthankot and Uri has led Indian policymakers to abandon a policy of conciliation toward Pakistan and instead to combine simultaneous military, economic and diplomatic coercion.\nThere was already a crisis in the Kashmir valley\n?The India-Pakistan crisis is not occurring in isolation. Since July, massive waves of protests have rocked the Indian-administered Kashmir Valley. These protests were triggered by the killing of militant Burhan Wani , a Hizbul mujahideen?leader who had become a popular face of resistance to India. The administrative and police apparatus of the state government broke down in large parts of the valley , leading to widespread curfews and massive deployments of Indian security forces.\nIndian forces have been criticized for an excessive reliance on pellet guns that have killed, maimed and blinded protesters , including children. More than 80?Kashmiri civilians have been killed . Large parts of the Kashmir Valley saw the writ of the state collapse amid large-scale backlash against Indian rule. The Indian army has been used to restore state control over many of these areas, with politicians and the state police unable to operate in the face of large-scale resistance.\nThis crisis has undermined the Indian governmentâ€™s strategy to overcome past rounds of protest, as in 2008 and 2010. As I wrote in 2013 , Delhi has relied on local â€œpro-Indiaâ€? political parties , promises of development aid and an extensive security presence to try to buy off, co-opt or suppress mobilization. This effort at restoring â€œnormalcyâ€? was undermined by many Kashmirisâ€™ rejection of the political status quo and exacerbated by an increasingly unpopular state coalition government between the valley-based Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This bred growing anger, disillusionment and a widespread belief that the Indian government has little interest in accommodating any Kashmiri demands.\nMany in the valley support an independent Jammu and Kashmir, while smaller numbers support accession to Pakistan. Waniâ€™s killing provided a focal point around which a variety of Kashmiri grievances coalesced.\nThis crisis within the valley had two effects. First, the widely publicized killing and blinding of civilians encouraged Pakistan to press India on the matter. Second, it has provided an opportunity for hard-liners in India to frame all Kashmiri protesters as Pakistani stooges or Islamist fanatics.\nWith the Indian raids and possible future escalation along the LOC, the valleyâ€™s ongoing crisis is now becoming even more closely fused to an India-Pakistan conflict, further reducing the likelihood of substantial political movement by the Indian government. The dysfunctional politics of the valley will be pushed to the?back burner until the next round of mass protests, as Indiaâ€™s politicians, media and public instead focus on Pakistan.\nIndian and Pakistan are also battling over facts and narratives\nThe novel thing about these raids is not that they happened, but that India has openly publicized them.\nPakistan, by contrast, has denied that any cross-LOC raid even occurred , blaming the deaths of its soldiers on Indian artillery shelling. We are still deep in the fog of war and much remains unclear, but both of these strategies have implications for how the crisis will play out.\nFor Indiaâ€™s Modi, this public stance has two audiences. First, it is intended to show his domestic electorate that India will not absorb attacks from Pakistan without a response. Modi campaigned as a strong leader who can take on Pakistan, making the Uri and Pathankot attacks a political vulnerability that the opposition Indian National Congress has sought to exploit .\nSecond, it is aimed at Pakistanâ€™s public and political class. The Pakistan army would know about a secret raid, as in the past.?By going public, Modi is signaling to Pakistani society at?large that India has been able to inflict damage on Pakistanâ€™s side of the LOC. It also may be intended to suggest that there would be further punishment if Pakistan retaliates.\nThe Pakistani response is currently more ambiguous. Simply denying that the raid happened at all may be an effort to preemptively limit escalation pressures . It could also let the Pakistan army claim that it was not caught by surprise and that it did not allow an actual cross-LOC raid. Cross-LOC artillery is a much more common, less dramatic occurrence and avoids embarrassing questions about preparedness.\nRegardless, we are seeing a fascinating battle of â€œ dueling truths â€? between India and Pakistan over what actually happened and what it means for the political relationship between the two countries.\nWhat about the risks of escalation?\nIndiaâ€™s raids are also intended to show that India has military room to operate below the threshold that would trigger major conventional, or even nuclear, escalation. As Manoj Joshi notes , the Indian army has explicitly said that it does not intend to continue operations and that it targeted militants and Pakistan army soldiers protecting them, not core formations or facilities of the Pakistan army itself. The raid has been framed as a matter of tactical, preemptive self-defense against militants, making it potentially less likely?to escalate than more aggressive military options.\nWith both militaries?now on high alert and the specter of nuclear weapons in the background, there are powerful incentives to avoid intensified conflict. U.S.?policymakers, for their part, are urging mutual restraint . A return to a tenuous stability is the most likely outcome, achieving Indian goals adequately without threatening Pakistanâ€™s core interests.\nNevertheless, the risk of escalation remains , especially if clashes spread beyond the LOC. Pakistanâ€™s military will seek some measure of retaliation, whether through direct attacks or, more likely, an increase in militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir. If this results in another major attack against Indian security forces, or especially civilians, Modi will face pressure to up the ante, which could push beyond his ability to surgically control.\nThis is the major risk of Indian strategy : Pakistan may dare Modi to move farther up the escalation ladder. Preventing this unwanted cycle of action and reaction will be the overwhelming priority of policymakers, in the subcontinent and beyond, in the days to come.\nPaul Staniland is an assistant professor of?political science at the University of Chicago.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	World

It will be the most ambitious and complex operation the Iraqi government has undertaken against the Islamic State since it roared across the country in 2014, and include approximately 30,000 Iraqi forces.\nMcGurk, speaking at the State Department, said thereâ€™s a â€œhumanitarian imperativeâ€? to expel the militants from Mosul as soon as possible. But he acknowledged putting the city back together will be a major undertaking. An extensive amount of planning has gone into understanding the political dynamics between different forces involved in the battle, the humanitarian assistance that will be required, and how local government will be organized after the battle, he said.\nThe remarks come after weeks of some U.S. and Iraqi officials questioning whether enough planning has been done to launch the battle, particularly in light of long-simmering political and religious tensions between groups that will be allied against the Islamic State in the operation. Concerns also remain that fighting in Mosul will provoke a sprawling humanitarian crisis with up to one million people internally displaced in Iraq.\nMcGurk acknowledged the concerns Friday, saying that while not all details of a transition after the battle have been finalized, the approach in place has worked â€œorganicallyâ€? in other Iraqi cities retaken from the Islamic State. He called the estimate that one million people will be displaced â€œapocalypticâ€? and unlikely to occur, and said land, supplies and accommodations will be ready for up to 750,000 people.\nâ€œIf we try to resolve everything before Mosul, Daesh will never get out of Mosul,â€? McGurk said, using an alternate name for the militants. â€œAnd this is really a war of momentum. We feel that momentum is on the side of the Iraqi security forces. But they are the ones that will set the date for when this launches.â€?\nA U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad, Air Force Col. John Dorrian, agreed with McGurkâ€™s assessment on when the operation could begin. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter authorized the deployment of an additional 600 U.S. troops to assist Iraqi troops in the Mosul operation late last month, and â€œa lot of themâ€? have arrived already, Dorrian said.\nâ€œWeâ€™re at the point where the Iraqis will initiate this at the time of their choosing,â€? Dorrian said. â€œAt this point, weâ€™re just waiting for the Iraqis to make the determination on when theyâ€™re ready to go.â€?\nU.S. military advisers are in the process of training the last of 12 Iraqi army brigades that could be involved in the offensive, Dorrian said. Each of them include between 800 and 1,600 soldiers. Many of the U.S. advisers are based at Qayyarah Airfield West, a base that Iraqi forces seized in July and about 40 miles south of the city. It will provide a landing spot for both helicopters and cargo planes during the offensive, serving as a key logistics hub.\nAn Obama administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity after McGurkâ€™s remarks, said the envoyâ€™s pronouncement should be considered significant. Itâ€™s unlikely the offensive will include the kind of airpower that was used during the â€œshock and aweâ€? campaign at the outset of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, the official said, but airstrikes will be carried out to allow Iraqi units to advance.\nKaren DeYoung contributed to this report.\nMore on Checkpoint:\n	washingtonpost	World

The battle for the northern city of Mosul could force a million people to flee their homes. But even before it begins, aid agencies are struggling to shelter families displaced by the conflict against the Islamic State.\nThe United Nations says it is nowhere near ready to deal with the fallout from the U.S.-backed offensive to retake Mosul from the militants, which could begin in less than a month.\nThe camps in northern Iraq are full. Debaga camp, 40 miles southeast of Mosul on the edges of the semiautonomous Kurdish region, was built a year ago for 700 families. It now houses 10 times as many people, most of whom fled fighting as Iraqi forces retook territory south of the city.\nCrowds gather around reporters, hoping they are aid workers bringing humanitarian assistance. â€œRegister me! Register me!â€? they shout. They complain they donâ€™t have mattresses, medicine, milk for their children or diapers.\nMany donâ€™t have tents, with 1,100 families here waiting for shelter. They bed down in the classrooms and yard of the campâ€™s school and in the hall of a mosque. Some have slung tarpaulins next to walls in an attempt to shield themselves from the sun.\nâ€œItâ€™s humiliating,â€? said Nahla Mohammed, 23, who fled bombing on her farm on the outskirts of Mosul five days earlier with her husband and three children and has been sleeping outside. She said she hadnâ€™t been able to get milk for her 1? -year-old daughter. â€œThere we were terrified and scared, but here we are hungry and weâ€™ve received nothing. We donâ€™t want to be here, we were forced to come.â€?\nWhen the offensive begins ? the biggest yet against Islamic State militants ? assistance is expected to be even more scarce. Aid organizations are strapped for resources.\n[ Signs of panic and rebellion in the Islamic Stateâ€™s self-proclaimed caliphate ]\nAbout 3.3?million people have been displaced in Iraq over the past 2? years, while the conflict in neighboring Syria has displaced millions more.\nIraqâ€™s finances have been squeezed by falling oil prices and years of grinding battles to retake territory, limiting the governmentâ€™s ability to respond. The United Nations put out an emergency appeal for $285?million to meet the needs of those expected to flee but says it is facing a shortfall of $165?million to provide the most basic emergency response.\nâ€œAlmost every victory is accompanied by a simultaneous humanitarian crisis,â€? said Lise Grande, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq. â€œItâ€™s a lot. Sometimes it feels like too much.â€?\nThe United Nations is scrambling to build standard camps like the one at Debaga. But if numbers reach the highest predictions, they will be able to handle only a fraction of those fleeing. Four standard camps, with the capacity for a total of 70,000 people, are expected to be completed during October, said Peter Hawkins, the UNICEF representative in Iraq.\nIraqi men who had fled the violence around Mosul board a bus in the Debaga camp before returning to their villages on Sept. 1, 2016. (Safin Hamed/AFP/Getty Images)\nHowever, many more could be displaced.\nAbout 2?million people lived in Mosul before the Islamic State took over, but it is difficult to know how many remain. The United Nations estimates that between 1.2?million and 1.5?million live there now. Some Iraqi officials contend that the population is higher because of the number of people who moved into the city to escape Iraqi army offensives to the south.\nThose who find no room at the new camps could turn to the U.N.â€™s emergency camps ? where assistance will be even more basic. Some, however, may flee into the desert toward the Syrian border, making it difficult for aid agencies to reach them.\nâ€œThe military campaign is going to take off soon, and on the humanitarian side we arenâ€™t yet ready,â€? Grande said.\nWith hopes of reducing the misery, the Iraqi government has dropped leaflets over Mosul asking people to stay in their homes during the offensive. In previous battles, for Fallujah and Ramadi, the cities have been emptied.\nâ€œOur main aim will be to preserve lives while still keeping people in their homes,â€? said Gen.?Abdul Ghani al-Asadi, head of Iraqâ€™s special forces. That had been achieved to an extent in an offensive last month for the town of Qayyarah, he said, â€œbut Mosul is bigger, so itâ€™s a much more complicated task.â€?\n[ U.S. adds more troops to Iraq ahead of Mosul offensive ]\nDespite the leaflets, civilians are risking their lives to leave.\nUmm Abbas, 40, who used a nickname because she still has family members in Mosul, fled the outskirts of the city in August. She was separated from her husband, who had gone into Mosul to sell vegetables at the time an offensive began and Kurdish forces moved toward their farm, she said. The family fled toward the Kurdish soldiers, but her 12-year-old nephew was killed by a suicide car bomber as they reached the Kurdish lines.\nâ€œNow weâ€™ve been here for a month and a half with no tent. We live here in the yard,â€? she said, indicating the packed school behind her at Debaga.\nOn arrival at the camp, men are separated from women and children and taken to buildings in a fenced-off area for screening by Kurdish security agencies. But even if they are cleared of having associations with the Islamic State, many arenâ€™t released because there isnâ€™t space to house them elsewhere.\nAbdullah Ahmed, 52, showed a deep hole in the sole of his foot.\nâ€œIâ€™ll have to chop off my leg by the time I get out of here,â€? he said, explaining that he has diabetes but has been unable to get insulin. Others complained that they had been held for weeks without being interviewed, raising concerns about how authorities will be able to deal with screenings when waves of people are displaced from Mosul.\nâ€œWe are trying our best to provide the basics of daily life,â€? said Rizgar Obaid, the campâ€™s director. â€œBut we lack space, we lack milk for the children and diapers.â€?\nGrande described the humanitarian operation as â€œone of the most complicatedâ€? in recent memory. With the Iraqi state so fractured, the United Nations is coordinating the aid effort with nearly 15 governmental and military bodies, she said.\nHowever, others have criticized international organizations for being inflexible and slow to respond to crises.\nâ€œIf they want to give out a bottle of water, they need permission from Geneva,â€? Obaid quipped.\nSlowly, some are going home. About 470 families left the camp to return to the village of Hajj Ali last week, cramming their belongings into trucks.\nâ€œWhatâ€™s sweeter than home?â€? one girl shouted from the back of a truck packed with water containers and mattresses as it drove off.\nIraqi forces, including Shiite militias, are preparing to launch an attack on the city of Hawijah. Islamic State militants are preventing civilians from leaving, but some have made it out, arriving at Debaga with stories of crucifixions, beheadings and hunger.\nâ€œThings are going to get much worse before they get better,â€? Obaid said.\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

What with sanctions over Crimea, tensions in Syria and saber-rattling in the Baltics, many here think?their country is already in a slowly simmering cold war with the United States, or serves as a convenient scapegoat during a fraught election campaign.\nSo now that?the Obama administration has officially accused the Kremlin?of attempting to interfere in U.S.?elections, Russians interviewed Saturday in Moscow?generally saw it as another sign?of?hatred toward Russia, and a desire to divert attention from issues unfavorable to Hillary Clinton.\n[ U.S. government officially accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections ]\nSome of their comments mirrored the comments made Saturday?by?Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who dismissed the U.S. allegations?as an organized effort?to?â€œstir up?unprecedented anti-Russian hysteriaâ€? in a statement on the ministry's website.?Ryabkov also repeated Moscow's offer, first made to?Washington last year, to discuss fighting cybercrime together.\nOf 13 people?approached by a reporter on Saturday, most did not think?that the Russian government performed or sponsored the hack.\nEven those who allowed that?Russia may have sponsored the hack of?computers of the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations said it was justified because the two countries are in conflict.\nThere are â€œno rules when you are in a war,â€? said Dmitry Prikolov, a 27-year-old sales manager at a Moscow real estate developer, as he scanned the aisles of a grocery store for chicken, carrots and peppers for a stir-fry.\nPrikolov?had not heard about Fridayâ€™s formal accusations by the Obama administration, but he knew that?Russian President Vladimir Putin has?denied complicity in the attacks ?and suggested the hackers had left a fake trail meant to implicate Russia.\nâ€œEveryone hacks everyone.

Kerry called Friday for the Syrian and Russian governments to face a war-crimes investigation over attacks on civilians in Syria.\nSpeaking in Washington alongside French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, Kerry said Russia and Syria had a â€œtargeted strategy to terrorize civilians and kill anybody who is in the way of their military objectives.â€?\nIn Geneva, the United Nations put the death toll in rebel?occupied eastern Aleppo at 377 over the past two weeks, with 1,286 injured. Actual figures, a U.N. spokesman said, â€œwere expected to be higher.â€? Repeated bombing of hospitals had left only six operating medical facilities and 30 doctors to serve a population of a quarter-million civilians.\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called Kerryâ€™s statements â€œunacceptable judgments.â€? Repeating Moscowâ€™s charge that the United States has failed to comply with a U.S.- Russia negotiated cease-fire last month that collapsed within a few days with renewed Syrian and Russian bombing, Ryabkov criticized â€œhigh-rankingâ€? U.S. officials who â€œare trying to lecture us and talk to us in an unacceptably conceited and arrogant tone.â€?\n[ Russia has its permanent air base in Syria. Now itâ€™s looking at Cuba and Vietnam ]\nMaria Zakharova, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, called Kerryâ€™s statement â€œpropaganda.â€? She referred to â€œvery serious legal consequencesâ€? behind the term â€œwar crimesâ€? and said that Kerry had used it â€œwith a view to escalating the situation.â€? She also suggested that the United States was guilty of war crimes in Iraq, Libya and Yemen.\nBoth Britain and France have previously spoken of Russian and Syrian war crimes in Aleppo, and Kerry last week described violations of â€œinternational law.â€?\nActual war-crimes investigations, which generally require action by the U.N. Security Council or by the International Criminal Court ? the United States, Russia and Syria are not members of the ICC ? have been few and far between. â€œWhat is unimaginable is that any international war-crimes effort could seriously investigate a great power that does not want to be investigated,â€? particularly a power with a Security Council veto, said Benjamin Wittes, who edits the Lawfare blog on national security.\nFrance has introduced a draft resolution in the council, expected to be voted upon on Saturday, calling for an immediate end to the Aleppo bombing.Ayrault, who met in Moscow on Thursday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, told Lavrov that he â€œhoped Russia would not want to be an accomplice to this tragedy, which mankind will remember,â€? the French minister said in a meeting with reporters in Washington.\nEvery nation, he said, must follow not only international law but also its own conscience. Should Russia veto the resolution, â€œwe will never give up simply because it is difficult,â€? Ayrault said.\nRussiaâ€™s ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, told reporters there Friday that he assumed the purpose of the resolution was to force Russia to veto it. â€œI donâ€™t see how we could possibly admit adoption of that resolution,â€? he said, according to Tass news service.\nCarol Morello contributed to this report.\npolitics\nNews and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11.\npost_newsletter353\n	washingtonpost	World

Andre Dakis/U.S. Marine Corps)\nIslamic State militants are suspected of firing a shell loaded with a chemical agent during an attack on U.S. and Iraqi troops in northern Iraq on Tuesday,?a Pentagon spokesman said.\nIf confirmed, it would be the first recorded chemical attack on U.S. troops since the Islamic State overran parts of northern and western Iraq in 2014. Despite their sometimes deadly?effects,?chemical rounds are often less lethal than their explosive counterparts.\nAccording to Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, only one of the shells lobbed at Qayyarah Airfield West, where U.S. troops are based, tested positive for a mustard agent.?There were no U.S. casualties, Davis said, and the shell, â€œlikely a rocket or mortar,?was imprecise and crude.â€?\nNo service members showed signs of mustard agent exposure, Davis added.?Concentrations of mustard agent?can cause agonizing burns and blisters, blindness and permanent disfigurement.?U.S. troops often deploy with protection against chemical weapons, including gas masks.\nâ€œThis attack has not impacted our mission in any way, nor have we changed our security posture in the area around Qayyarah,â€? Davis said.\nIn the past, when investigating chemical weapon attacks, U.S. forces have conducted a preliminary investigation of the weapon in the field before?sending it for extensive lab testing and analysis.\nQayyarah Airfield West, also known as Key West, was retaken by Iraqi security forces in July and has been slowly converted into a staging point for the upcoming campaign to seize the city of Mosul, one of the Islamic Stateâ€™s last strongholds in Iraq.\nThe sprawling base?once housed thousands of troops and numerous aircraft during the Iraq War, but after it was captured by the Islamic State in 2014, it was systematically mined and its facilities destroyed. According to defense officials, the degraded state of the base has made it difficult to turn it into an effective staging area for the approaching Mosul battle.\nThe Islamic State has?used?chemical weapons, in the past, most notably against?Kurdish peshmerga positions in northern Iraq. The weapons, a mixture of mustard and chlorine agents crudely loaded into a variety of artillery, mortar shells and rockets, have not been widely used.\nThe U.S.-led coalition ? in an attempt to stymie the groupâ€™s ability to make?the weapons ? has targeted individuals associated with overseeing their production and facilities where chemical ordnance is manufactured.\nEarlier this month U.S. and coalition aircraft targeted a converted pharmaceutical factory in northern Iraq thought to have been a chemical weapons production facility.

But that would mean never going into Mosul.\nAs the Center for Strategic and International Studiesâ€™s Anthony Cordesman just pointed out, postwar scenarios usually are not implemented as planned, and the problems targeted are often intractable. For example, we dealt with the Mosul governance problems that the editorial cited for a decade with limited success. Of course prepare, especially for doable things such as refugees and relief delivery, and, as the editorial urged, keep the United States involved long term.\nBut the ugly situation the editorial correctly predicted after Mosulâ€™s liberation, as we have seen in other areas liberated from the Islamic State, will likely be better than life under it. In wars of choice with hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops, a perfect post-conflict plan should be a prerequisite; for necessary conflicts such as against the Islamic State, with limited U.S. costs, demanding such a plan is a recipe for permanent delay.\nJames Jeffrey, Alexandria\nThe writer was ambassador to Iraq\nfrom 2010 to 2012 and deputy charge\nof mission there from 2004 to 2005.\nopinions\nNews and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.\npost_newsletter348\n	washingtonpost	World

Richards/AFP/Getty Images); Hillary Clinton (David Goldman/AP)\nDonald Trump has openly questioned U.S. treaty commitments to mutual defense and nuclear proliferation agreements. What do statements like this mean for U.S. foreign policy? We polled international relations (IR) scholars at U.S. colleges and universities about the foreign policy implications of a possible Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency.\nOverwhelmingly, IR scholars expect a Trump presidency to negatively affect U.S. relations with its allies ? and damage U.S. credibility with Russia and China. By contrast, the scholars believe a Clinton presidency would have little impact on U.S. relations with either allies or adversaries.\nWhile IR scholars are, on average, more liberal than the public as a whole, we found conservative and moderate IR scholars are nearly as apprehensive about a Trump presidency as their more liberal colleagues, and they are significantly more negative about Trump than their conservative and moderate counterparts within the U.S. public .\nThis survey, the ninth in a series of snap polls conducted by the Teaching, Research and International Policy (TRIP) Project , includes responses from 744 of the 4,078 IR scholars teaching and/or researching at colleges and universities throughout the United States. TRIPâ€™s Data Dashboard includes the results of this poll, which asked IR scholars 13 questions between Oct. 5 and 9. Hereâ€™s what we found:\nWhich candidate reflects the foreign policy views of IR scholars?\nAn overwhelming majority (82 percent) responded â€œHillary Clintonâ€? (see Figure 1, below). Just under 4 percent of the scholars surveyed said â€œDonald Trump,â€? while 14 percent chose to write in a third-party candidate, other national political figure, or some variation on â€œnone of the above.â€?\nWe asked respondents to identify their own political leanings, and Figure 2 shows a similar preference order is apparent across the ideological spectrum. Clinton most closely reflects the foreign policy views of 90 and 84 percent of liberal and moderate respondents, respectively. Exactly half the conservative IR scholars in our poll prefer Clinton, while only 7 percent prefer Trump. Among no ideological subgroup does Trump come close to breaking out of third place.\nFigure 1\n?\nFigure 2\nThese results are consistent with our previous?survey of IR scholars conducted during the February primary campaigns, which found that IR scholars believed that Hillary Clinton would do a better job managing U.S. foreign policy than Bernie Sanders; and that Donald Trump would be a less effective foreign policy president than most of his GOP competitors.\n[ Will foreign policy be a major issue in the 2016 election? Hereâ€™s what we know. ]\nIR scholars lean left, but this preference for Clinton over Trump likely reflects respondentsâ€™ expertise on foreign policy as much as their ideology. To illustrate this point, consider a recent Pew Research Center survey of the general public, which asks which candidate would do a better job on foreign policy. Among conservative members of the public, 54 percent prefer Trump to Clinton, but only 7 percent of conservative foreign policy experts prefer Trump. And while 23 percent of self-described moderate voters believe that Trump would be better on foreign policy, only 5 percent of moderate scholars agree.\nSimilarly, many nonpartisan and GOP foreign policy experts and practitioners have not only come out against Trump ; many of these experts also affirmatively support Clinton . Our survey results suggest that individuals who spend their careers studying and working in the area of international relations are deeply skeptical of Trumpâ€™s foreign policy approach precisely because they understand the details and the complexities of this policy area. In previous work we discovered a similar epistemic consensus among experts on the folly of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nTrumpâ€™s election would damage U.S. foreign relations\nTrump has said that as president he would come to the defense of NATO countries only if they â€œ fulfill their obligations to us ,â€? argued that the United States can no longer afford to honor its defense pact with Japan, and implied that he would encourage more states to secure nuclear weapons , a violation of U.S. obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In every case, Hillary Clinton has strongly disagreed with Trump.\n[ Is the public really learning to love globalization? ]\nSo we asked IR scholars how the election of Clinton or Trump would affect relations between the United States and its allies. Figure 3 shows that over 95 percent of scholars said Trump would have a negative effect on relations between the United States and NATO states, and 91 percent of scholars believe that the election of Donald Trump would cause NATO allies to doubt the U.S. commitment to the defense of Europe. By comparison, about 3 percent of scholars said Clinton would have a negative effect on relations between the United States and its NATO allies, and only 2 percent said her election would lead NATO allies to doubt the U.S. commitment.\nFigure 3\nIR scholars have long argued that governments make alliance commitments to shape the expectations of other states, both to reassure allies, but also to make it clear to potential adversaries that any aggression will be costly to the attacking state. In this context, IR scholars were concerned about how Trumpâ€™s election might embolden aggressive behavior in states like Russia and China. Over 80 percent of scholars believe that Trumpâ€™s election would lead Russia to doubt the U.S. commitment to the defense of Europe, while just over 3 percent said the same of Clinton.\nWhile respondents were more concerned about how Russia might react, 70 percent of respondents also said that the Trumpâ€™s election would lead China to doubt the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan, with similar numbers for questions on the U.S. commitment to the defense of South Korea (70 percent) and Taiwan (about 68 percent).\nThe prospect of Clintonâ€™s election, on the other hand, raised less alarm among IR scholars. Only about 3 percent of respondents indicated that Clintonâ€™s election would cause China to doubt the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan and South Korea, and approximately 4 percent said it would lead China to doubt the U.S. commitment to the defense of Taiwan.\nWho will deal best with Russia?\nOn the campaign trail, Trump asked, â€œWhen you think about it, wouldnâ€™t it be nice if we got along with Russia?â€? He has argued that the United States would be better off finding common ground with Russia and cooperating more effectively to defeat the Islamic State and negotiate a settlement in Ukraine.\n[ Why Putin and Obama use fighting words when they donâ€™t want to fight ]\nIR scholars we surveyed are skeptical that Trumpâ€™s purported dealmaking skills would benefit the United States. Our respondents believe that any future deals between Russia and a Trump administration would be â€œless likelyâ€? to benefit the United States. Broadly speaking, scholars see the election of Hillary Clinton as a continuation of Obamaâ€™s foreign policy and thus expect â€œno effectâ€? of a Clinton presidency (see Figure 4).\nFigure 4\nDan Maliniak is assistant professor of government at the College of William and Mary.?\nSusan Peterson is the Wendy and Emery Reves Professor of Government and International Relations at the College of William and Mary.?\nHannah Petrie is a 2016 graduate of William & Mary and a TRIP project manager.?\nRyan Powers ?is a PhD candidate in political science at University of?Wisconsin at Madison.?\nMichael Tierney is the George and Mary Hylton Professor of Government and International Relations at the College of William and Mary and the director of the AidData Center for Development Policy.?TRIP Snap Polls are conducted with support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	World

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\nTODAY'S BIG IDEA is by Breanne Deppisch:\nUPPER DUBLIN, Pa.--Donald Trumpâ€™s narrowing path to the presidency depends on winning Pennsylvania. One of his advisers was quoted just yesterday saying that he will be â€œ?cookedâ€? if he cannot prevail in the Keystone State.\nThe GOP nominee is counting on Rust Belt voters in western Pennsylvania, who have traditionally voted Democratic but been battered by deindustrialization, to come out in droves for him. He needs enough to offset Hillary Clintonâ€™s huge advantages in the urban areas of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\nBut thatâ€™s not enough. He also needs to turn in a respectable showing in the vote-rich suburban areas outside Philly.\nTwo days of interviews in the so-called â€œcollar countiesâ€? around the City of Brotherly Love reveal profound problems for Trump in this area, even as he visited for a rally. I canvassed two dozen voters at three different sports bars ? before, during and after the Eagles game last Sunday ? in places where there should be pockets of Trump support. Most of the people watching football were white men, a good demographic for Trump. But they were also college educated and had white-collar jobs, not so good demographics for him.\nThe experience buttressed the findings of a recent Bloomberg poll that found Clinton carrying these suburban counties with a 28-point advantage over Trump. Thatâ€™s an 18-point improvement on Obamaâ€™s winning margin against Mitt Romney in 2012, when the Republican did not meaningfully contest the state until the final days. The Democratic nominee is carrying almost every single group in this area.\nItâ€™s hard to overstate the strategic importance of these four suburban counties (Bucks, Montgomery, Chester and Delaware), which together account for more than one-fifth of the electorate in the Keystone State. It has been 40 years since a presidential candidate carried Pennsylvania without winning the so-called critical â€œsuburban collar.â€?\nAt the bars, in fact, it proved surprisingly difficult to find just one fan of The Donald during a day-long odyssey. It was, however, easy to find split-ticket voters, people supporting Clinton and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey for reelection.\nIn a reflection of just how demographically polarized this election has become, I asked these folks where to find Trump supporters. For the first time, a group of boisterous Eagles fans at Ye Olde Ale House sunk into contemplative silence. â€œUhhhh, I donâ€™t know,â€? said a 20-something chemist. Another stopped guzzling his beer. â€œWant me to Google like, an even sketchier bar than this one?â€? he asked. Brian, an IT specialist, said Trumpâ€™s rhetoric â€œgoes back to [Joseph] Goebbels, to Hitler.â€? He said he could not think of a single friend or even colleague at work who backs the GOP nominee.\nA chorus of independent-minded voters who said they have supported Republicans in the past wondered why Trump keeps coming back. He campaigned last Friday night in nearby Newtown. A personal trainer wondered â€œwhy he wastes the gasâ€? to fly here. An Uber driver said Trumpâ€™s time would be better spent in Ohio: â€œItâ€™s almost like, what is he even doing here? Why is he not spending more time there?â€?\nSome of this is bigger than Trump. The areaâ€™s changing demographics have shifted the counties measurably to the left over the past 15 years. But statewide Republicans have continued to do well, and a couple voters volunteered that they would have happily voted for John Kasich had he won the GOP nod.\nPennsylvania tends to be a siren song for Republicans. Bush played very hard in 2004 but came up 2.5 points short to John Kerry.\nOne theme which kept coming up is that Trump could have done much better. Four of five months ago, if he had actually â€œpivotedâ€? ? as the campaign kept promising ? he might have made inroads. There is still little love for Clinton. But his lack of seriousness and the disclosure of the 2005 video that showed Trump speaking lewdly about women might have baked the cake. â€œI will never get over Trumpâ€™s comments in that video,â€? said one gruff-voiced woman, who teaches at an elementary school and thinks of her two teenage nieces every time she hears the Republican nominee talking. â€œIt makes me shudder,â€? said the self-described moderate. She went on to express concerns about Clintonâ€™s â€œlack of transparencyâ€? and said she may end up casting her ballot for Gary Johnson.\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.\nWith contributions from Elise Viebeck ( @eliseviebeck ).\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\nPOLLING ROUNDUP:\n-- A new Washington Post/ABC News tracking poll finds Clintonâ€™s lead shrinking to just four points over Trump, 48 to 44 percent. Still, nearly twice as many voters (59 to 30 percent) expect Clinton to win over Trump. The number of people who said she will win â€œeasilyâ€? also spikes from 19 to 27 percent. ?\nMeanwhile, worries have waned about voter fraud in the U.S. since Trump first began warning against a â€œriggedâ€? election earlier this month. Fewer than four in 10 voters now say voter fraud occurs very or somewhat often (37 percent), down from 47 percent in early September.

Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), seeking to unseat GOP Sen. Mark Kirk in Illinois, invoked her familyâ€™s military service while answering a debate question. 'My family has served this nation in uniform going back to the Revolution,' Duckworth said. 'I am a daughter of the American Revolution. Iâ€™ve bled for this nation. But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound. Because people are quick to sound the drums of war, and I want to be there to say this is what it costs, this is what youâ€™re asking us to do. . . . Families like mine are the ones that bleed first.'?Kirk was offered a chance to rebut. 'Iâ€™d forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington,' he said.?\n"Duckworthâ€™s mother, Lamai, is Thai, but her late father, Franklin, was a Marine veteran whose family roots in this country trace to before the American Revolution," DeBonis notes. "Duckworth was severely wounded in the Iraq War, losing her legs while serving as a helicopter pilot. The moderator moved on to the next question, but a panelist gave Duckworth time to respond by detailing her family history ? including the fact that the Daughters of the American Revolution? erected a statue ?of her in Mount Vernon, Ill."\nA statement issued by Kirk campaign spokeswoman Eleni Demertzis did not include an apology from the senator or any claim that Duckworth has misrepresented her family heritage.\nA campaign plane carrying Mike Pence rests on the edge of the tarmac after sliding off the runway at LaGuardia Airport in New York.

(John Minchillo/AP)\n-- Trial balloon of the day?? Politico ?sent a breaking news alert last night to say?that?Clintonâ€™s transition team is eyeing Joe Biden to be secretary of state. A single, unnamed source said the vice president is at the top of their internal short list, though no one has talked to him about it.\n-- It is hard for us to envision Hillary ultimately going with the 73-year-old:\nThey often do not see eye to eye on foreign policy.?When she was secretary of state, she was far more hawkish and he was more dovish. They made different recommendations to President Obama during the first term on how to handle Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria.\nAnd then there was the Osama bin Laden raid.?When it looked like Biden might run, Clinton noted in a not-so-subtle dig that he had been against the OBL raid. The day before he took himself out of the running, the V.P. said at a public event that he had privately urged the president to go forward with it. Bidenâ€™s story has continued to evolve. In 2012, he told a congressional retreat that he said: â€œMr. President, my suggestion is, don't go.â€? (Last year, Greg Jaffe tracked his varying public comments. )\nThe Clintons value loyalty above all else. Biden has been campaigning hard for her the past few months, but he came very close to running against her just one year ago. And he has mused publicly after he passed on 2016 that he occasionally has regrets that decision. Clinton knows Foggy Bottom as well as anyone because she spent four years there. Why wouldn't she put a loyalist there? Someone
 who she and Bill know won't freelance or get them into trouble with gaffes?\nTo be sure, Biden sat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a long time and the White House has put a bunch of foreign hotspots in his portfolio. He'd?bring gravitas, stature and continuity that might reassure some of the world leaders who have been alarmed about the rise of Trump, from NATO allies in Eastern Europe who are worried about Russia to Asian countries worried that we won't have their backs against China. But it's always seemed pretty clear that Clinton and Biden have meaningfully different world views.\n--? Our Elise Viebeck reported on Tuesday that, over in Foggy Bottom, the diplomatic establishment is rooting for one of its own: â€œThereâ€™s Bill Burns, a distinguished ex-diplomat and Clintonâ€™s former deputy at State who now leads the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Thereâ€™s also Nick Burns (no relation), a former undersecretary for political affairs at State who now teaches at Harvardâ€™s Kennedy School of Government. Both have been touted as potential State Department heads, particularly if Clinton wants to bring a nonpartisan sensibility to the job. â€¦ Jim Steinberg, another former Clinton deputy at State, and Wendy Sherman, a top negotiator of the Iran nuclear deal, are also in the mix, though seen as less likely picks for Clinton.â€?\nThe person getting the most buzz around town is Tom Donilon, President Obamaâ€™s former national security adviser and co-chairman of Clintonâ€™s transition. â€œAttend any foreign policy event in town and you will hear the talk about Donilon in the slot,â€? Viebeck notes. â€œSome see him as just another candidate among equals; others insist heâ€™s a shoo-in for the job.â€?\nClarence Thomas walks to his car after attending mass in D.C.

Pooley/Getty Images)\nTHE DAILY DONALD:\n-- As his campaign barrels towards a probable loss, Trump continues to widen the scope of the alleged conspiracy against him. â€œWhen the people who control the political power in our society can rig investigations like [Clintonâ€™s] investigation was rigged, can rig polls, you see the phony polls, and rig the media, they can wield absolute power over your life â€¦ and benefit big-time by it,â€? the reality TV star said at a St. Augustine rally. â€œThey control what you hear and what you donâ€™t hear, what is covered, how itâ€™s covered, even if itâ€™s covered at all.â€?\nâ€œThe â€˜power structureâ€™ he describes, according to a review of his speeches this week, includes banking institutions, the judiciary, media conglomerates, voting security experts, Democratic tricksters, scientific polling and also perhaps military leaders,"? Jose DelReal and Sean Sullivan note. "He has also accused Clinton of meeting â€˜with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty to enrich these global financial powers, her special-interest friends and her donors.â€™?By emphasizing such rhetoric, Trump, who has a history of circulating unsubstantiated accusations, has sown distrust in basic democratic institutions among his supporters. But many critics are concerned by the extent to which Trump is relying on grand conspiracies to explain away his electoral troubles, including some who hear unnerving echoes of historically anti-Semitic rhetoric in Trumpâ€™s references to global elites and nefarious bankers.â€?\n-- Trump's reckless rhetoric is demonstrably bad for our democracy: A new USA Today/Suffolk poll finds that more than two-thirds of Trump supporters think the election results could be manipulated, and 43 percent say corruption will be to blame if he loses.\n-- A national militia group called on its members to perform â€œincognito intelligence gathering and crime spottingâ€? at polling locations across the country on Nov. 8 in order to watch for signs of a â€œrigged election.â€?

A D.C.-based civil rights group said it will ask Department of Justice officials to investigate the groupâ€™s actions.

 candidates have cut ads distancing themselves from Trump, but this is the first time the NRCC, the committee charged with electing Republicans to the House, has explicitly used the message that not supporting the Republican presidential nominee is a good thing. â€˜Dold is an independent voice who stood up to Donald Trump months ago,â€™ the narrator in the ad says. The ad then shows a clip of Dold declaring, on CNN, â€˜I think Donald Trump has disqualified himself.â€™ The ad has been on air since earlier this week.

FiveThirtyEightâ€™s database lists almost a thousand national polls, and that doesnâ€™t count all the surveys at the state level â€¦ [which are] just as worrying for Trump.â€?\nIndependent and third-party voters donâ€™t trust Trump: â€œTrumpâ€™s problem here is one he has had all along. While he boasts a large number of enthusiastic supporters, people who arenâ€™t committed to him tend to view him with a lot of mistrust.â€?\nA referendum isnâ€™t a Presidential election: â€œWhile both situations represented an opportunity for voters to endorse a change in the status quo, voters in the UK were asked to decide on an idea whereas in the U.S. they are being asked to decide on a person,â€? said Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips.\n-- Republican S.E. Cupp writes in a New York Times op-ed about the GOP's damaged brand: â€œ[Trump] has sent the party back to the Dark Ages â€¦ with his provincial notions of masculinity and misogynist notions of femininity, his cartoonish bombast, his vulgar jocularity and his open hostility to women who question him. In short, heâ€™s reaffirmed the worst stereotypes about Republicans that Democrats have pushed for decades.?It would be nice to be able to argue that Mr. Trump is an aberration, but clearly he has found a great deal of support. Who will believe us when we say that he does not speak for us? In 2012, an unknown, inconsequential congressman from Missouriâ€™s Second District, Todd Akin, sent the Republican presidential race into a tailspin when he argued that rape victims should not be allowed to get abortions â€¦ The stench of Mr. Akin hung around the party for months, if not years.

Planning for a Democratic victory on Nov. 8, these interest groups and like-minded lawmakers are laying the groundwork to push Clinton, if she is elected, to prove her progressive bona fides through early legislation and personnel appointments. One liberal group has already forwarded 150 names of acceptable appointees for economic positions to Clintonâ€™s transition team, while others on the left are engaged in opposition research against prospects â€¦ whom they see as unacceptable. Leading liberal lawmakers ? including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders ? have also started conveying, privately and publicly, guidance on top Clinton appointees and legislative priorities. The activity reflects the fragile alliance between Clinton and the progressive wing of her party as she nears the end of a tumultuous race against Republican Donald Trump.\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\nAfter Twitter said it would shut down Vine, Vine's founder threw this shade:\nDonâ€™t sell your company!\nTo honor Vine as it gets phased out, here are some of our favorite political Vines:\nCan't beat this one:\nGreat image of Pence tossing around a football at LaGuardia Airport:\nThis crop of a Mike Pence photo taken by @dangallo is one of my favorite images in weeks. pic.twitter.com/k9ptYrQc0o\n?

Hsu October 28 at 2:18 PM\nA onetime aide of Russian President Vladi?mir Putin whose body was found last year in a D.C. hotel room died of head injuries suffered in accidental falls after days of â€œexcessiveâ€? drinking, authorities in Washington said Friday as they closed the death investigation.\nMikhail Y. Lesin, 57, a former Russian advertising executive who helped create the Kremlinâ€™s global English-language Russia Today television network, was found dead Nov. 5 in the upscale Dupont Circle Hotel, and for much of a year, the manner of death was ruled â€œundetermined.â€?\n[ Former Putin aide found dead in D.C. hotel ]\nThe manner has been amended to an accident with â€œacute ethanol intoxicationâ€? as a contributing cause, the office of U.S. Attorney Channing D. Phillips said Friday. Lesin was alone in his hotel room at the time of the falls, the statement said.\nThe new ruling was made by the office of the D.C. chief medical examiner.\nMikhail Lesin in 2002 photo. (Alexander Natruskin/Reuters)\nShortly after Lesinâ€™s body was found, his family said he died as the result of a heart attack.\nMore than four months later, the chief medical examinerâ€™s office and D.C. police set off worldwide speculation when they said Lesin had suffered blunt-force injuries to his head and elsewhere on his body, although not explicitly declaring his death a criminal act.\n[ Death investigation remains mystery ]\nThe statement Friday said that the investigation determined from video footage, interviews and other evidence that Lesin entered his room for the final time about 10:45?a.m. Nov. 4 after days of excessive alcohol consumption and was found dead the next morning. He â€œsustained the injuries that resulted in his death while alone in his hotel room,â€? the statement said.\nLesin died of blunt-force injuries to his head, the statement said, and also suffered injuries to his neck, torso, arms and legs caused by falls.\nIn describing the investigation, the statement referred to â€œnew evidenceâ€? developed in the nearly year-long investigation.\nAuthorities say the death of Mikhail Lesin in Washington, DC, last year was caused partly by alcohol poisoning after days of heavy drinking. (Reuters)\nAsked about that reference, Bill Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office, said, â€œWe typically do not comment on specifics of our investigation and have no further comment on this particular matter.â€?\nOn Friday, interim D.C. police chief Peter Newsham said, â€œI am comfortable with the ruling being an accidental death.â€?\nThe investigation of Lesinâ€™s death was conducted by D.C. police and the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office with assistance from the FBI, the statement said.\nLesin, who made his fortune in the advertising business in the 1990s, was an architect of the Kremlin-dominated media landscape under Putin. As minister of the press during Putinâ€™s first term as president from 2000 to 2004, Lesin orchestrated the takeover of the independent television network NTV and oversaw government propaganda and censorship laws during the war in Chechnya. In 2005, he helped launch Russia Today, now RT, a government-funded channel that broadcasts news with a pro-Moscow slant around the world.\nKnown for his volatile temper, Lesin was reported to have antagonized powerful media interests, and an investigation by the anti-Putin whistleblower Alexei Navalny in 2014 revealed that Lesin owned real estate in the United States worth millions of dollars. He resigned later that year as head of Gazprom-Media, a holding company that owns several prominent pro-Kremlin TV networks, and kept a low profile until his death.\nTwo days before his body was found, Lesin failed to appear as expected at a $10,000-a-table fundraiser in Washington organized by the Woodrow Wilson Centerâ€™s Kennan Institute, whose honorees included a philanthropist and chief executive of the largest private bank in Russia.\nKremlin critics earlier this year theorized that Lesin may have been killed because officials feared that he was about to cut a deal with federal authorities investigating his land dealings in California.\nHowever, a longtime friend and business associate of Lesinâ€™s, Sergey Vasiliev, said in March that he believed that Lesin died after a bout of heavy drinking, an account he said he formed after speaking to the Russian Foreign Ministry and others familiar with the sequence of events.\nAndrew Roth and Peter Hermann contributed to this report.\nlocal\n	washingtonpost	World

A smothering Syrian blockade and round-the-clock airstrikes have sought to starve and shock rebel-held areas of Aleppo into surrender. On Friday came the counterpunch: The rebels launched an apparent last-ditch effort to end the governmentâ€™s siege.\nA failure by the rebels ? a patchwork of militiamen and Islamist factions ? to gain some breathing room could be a crippling blow to efforts to hold one of the last opposition strongholds.\nForces of the Syrian government and its partners, including Russia and Iran, have vowed to slam eastern Aleppo until the resistance is broken. A drawn-out fight in Aleppo, however, would display the resolve of opposition groups and force President Bashar al-Assad to decide whether to fight on or make an embarrassing pullback.\nThe gambit by the rebel forces seeks to take the battle to the government-held lines. The immediate aim is to open routes for supplies and reinforcements into rebel zones in eastern Aleppo, where more than 200,000 people face death in air raids and as a result of severe shortages of food and medicine.\n[ Gallery: Scenes from Aleppo ]\nAhead of Fridayâ€™s assault, rebel fighters released videos declaring that their offensive would deal a blow to Assad and his allies, including Shiite militiamen from Iran, Lebanon and Iraq. Russia backs Assad with warplanes and other battlefield equipment.\nThe rebels fired artillery indiscriminately at government-held neighborhoods in Aleppo, bringing a surge in violence to relatively calm areas. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict, said the shelling killed 15 people and wounded more than 100 in western Aleppo.\nJabhat Fatah al-Sham ? an al-Qaeda-linked, anti-Assad force formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra ? said it carried out at least one suicide bombing. The various claims of casualties and attacks could not be independently verified.\nâ€œBad news for Bashar and his gangs. Our fighters love to die in the same way Bashar loves to live,â€? a fighter from the Islamist Faylaq al-Sham unit says in a video, referring to the Syrian leader. The pronouncement is made against a background of Koranic verses.\nThe battle for Aleppo has become a crucial struggle in the more than five-year-old Syrian conflict because of its symbolic and strategic significance. It was Syriaâ€™s largest city before the war, with a population then approaching 3?million. Many residents have since fled.\nRebels stormed Aleppoâ€™s eastern districts in 2012, and the area is now their last major urban base.\n[ Aleppoâ€™s children in the line of fire ]\nThe city also has increasingly taken on international significance amid heightened friction between the West and Russia, which intervened militarily on Assadâ€™s behalf last year.\nMoscowâ€™s aircraft have joined government warplanes in intensifying attacks on hospitals and residences in eastern Aleppo in recent weeks. Moscow has denied links to some airstrikes, including an air assault on a school in northern Syria this week that left more than two dozen people dead, many of them children.\nRising violence by Syria and its allies scuttled a cease-fire brokered last month by the United States and Russia. The bloodshed has drawn an international outcry because of widely circulated images from Aleppo showing devastation such as bombed-out hospitals and dead civilians, including children.\nIn Moscow on Friday, Syriaâ€™s foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, said the government could agree to a â€œhumanitarian pauseâ€? in attacks on Aleppo if rebel forces allow civilians to leave areas they control.\nBut the foreign ministers of Russia and Iran told their Syrian counterpart that they would intensify the fight against â€œterrorismâ€? in Syria, without giving specific details on potential targets.\nThe presence of al-Qaeda-linked fighters and other Islamist militants in battles for the city has introduced major political complications to the conflict. Syria and Russia claim they are seeking to fight â€œterrorists,â€? a term that they regularly use to describe most, if not all, of Assadâ€™s opposition. And the West and its partners have been unable to draw clear distinctions between the militias they back and the extremist forces.\nRelatively moderate rebels play down the role of the extremists, even as al-Qaeda-linked fighters and allied Islamist militants exert considerable sway over the rebellion, which began in 2011 with peaceful rallies during the Arab Spring uprisings.\nWestern officials have expressed concern about a flotilla of Russian warships ? including an aircraft carrier capable of holding 40 planes ? that appears to be making its way toward the Syrian coast, possibly to help Assadâ€™s forces in Aleppo.\nLt. Col. Abu Bakr, commander of the Jaish al-Mujahideen rebel group, said the new offensive has yielded success.\nâ€œWeâ€™ve launched tens of rockets on regime positions, and weâ€™ve broken through the governmentâ€™s first line of defense,â€? said Bakr, speaking from Aleppo over the WhatsApp messenger service. â€œThere are about 5,000 rebels participating, and we think this will last a weekâ€? until the siege is broken.\nSyrian state media, however, reported that government forces repelled the rebel assaults.\nZakaria Zakaria in Istanbul contributed to this report.\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

He was asked during a news conference how much he'd spend, replying â€œI would say, 'whatever it takes.'" Pressed for a hard number a reporter threw out $100 million. â€œWe will see,â€? Trump replied. â€œWe'll see what happens.â€?\nBy that September, Trump was talking $100 million up to the New York Times. In fact, that was â€œat the lower endâ€? of what he might put in.\nHe'd already put in $2 million through the third quarter of 2015. By March, when the nomination contest was a full-on war, Trump had loaned or given his campaign (through cash or in-kind contributions) $36.2 million. By May, when he clinched the nomination, Trump was in for $46.1 million.\nThen he hit the brakes. Once the general election kicked off, Trump tossed out the idea that he'd self-fund his whole campaign. He started chipping in a few million dollars a month, and that was it.\nMost of his fundraising since May came from other people.\n...so the percentage of all of the money he'd raised was well under $100 million.\nYet for some reason, Trump continues to insist that he'll put $100 million into the race. On Friday, hours after his campaign manager confirmed to Fox News that Trump â€œhas said publicly many times he is in for $100 million, and he is happy to invest in his campaign,â€? Fox News's Bret Baier reported that Trump had told him he was writing a $10 million check today. (He told The Wall Street Journal that he'd wired the funds this morning.) Trump wouldn't confirm that he'd get to $100 million, but, still.\nThat would bring Trump to about $66.1 million of his own money overall ? a bit shy of what he'd repeatedly pledged.\nAnd that's assuming that he actually transfers the money. Trump's got a sort of iffy track record on cutting promised checks; it was only after The Post repeatedly asked about a commitment Trump had made to veterans' groups that Trump finally donated the money earlier this year. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday morning that heâ€™d already wired it, so it should show up in campaign reports shortly.\nOn Oct 1, I got an email from Trump pledging to triple donations for 24 hrs.\nDonors gave $165,829 that day.\nTrump gave $30,682 all month.\n? Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) October 28, 2016\nIf Trump did wire?the check, he's probably still not going to hit the $100 million mark in the next 11 days. But he's always got a good way to spin it: As always, Donald Trump managed to negotiate his opponent (in this case, Donald Trump) down. This Trump guy wanted Trump to put up $100 million; Trump got the job done for only $66 million. He's a dealmaker, it's what he does.\nThe alternative is that Trump's big-spending promises were mostly bluster, and that certainly couldn't be the case.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	World

Here's the evidence.	2016-10-28 00:00:00	Got it\nBy Pippa Norris October 21\nDuring the final presidential debate, Hillary Clinton listed things Donald Trump believes are "rigged" against him, including the Emmys. Trump retorted that he "should've gotten" an Emmy for "The Apprentice." (The Washington Post)\nIn recent days, Donald Trump has ratcheted up claims of voter fraud, claiming that the Nov. 8 election may be â€œriggedâ€? against him. In Wednesdayâ€™s debate, he refused to pledge that he would accept the result if he loses, saying that he would keep the nation â€œin suspense.â€?\nThese sorts of claims are common among sore losers in authoritarian states, sometimes not without good reason. But casting serious doubt on the outcome is a radical departure from established practices among political leaders in democratic states during the modern era ? and from previous U.S. nominees in our lifetime. Trumpâ€™s claims are particularly concerning given that there is little evidence of voter fraud in modern elections.\nSo why make these false allegations?\nThese types of claims may serve several strategic functions. They provide sore losers with a way to save face, excusing a poor performance. They also may erode the electoral legitimacy of the winner, sowing doubts about their governing authority, as well as causing chaos by making it harder to bring Congress and the country together after a bitterly fought campaign.\n[ Itâ€™s not just Trump. Authoritarian populism is rising across the West. Hereâ€™s why. ]\nThe main effect?of these charges on the mass electorate may be to discourage turnout (â€œWhy should I bother to vote if itâ€™s all rigged?â€?), weaken confidence in the presidency, Congress and political parties, and erode satisfaction with the performance of American democracy. My book â€œ Why Electoral Integrity Matters,â€? the first volume in a trilogy on the subject published by Cambridge University Press, demonstrates consistent evidence from the World Values Survey that these sorts of perceptions of electoral integrity matter for trust and confidence in elections and democracy in many countries.\nBut do they also affect turnout in U.S. elections?\nIn 2012, the most authoritative and long-standing academic survey of the electorate, the American National Election Study , asked a series of questions to monitor citizensâ€™ views about the integrity of elections. Because parties are polarized about electoral malpractice, like everything else in American politics, the items sought to test the effects of diverse claims common among different parties. In particular, Republicans are more prone to argue that the vote count is unfair (Rudolph W. Giuliani: â€œ Dead people generally vote for Democratsâ€? ). They are also most likely to charge that news media coverage is unfair, as journalists are assumed to share a liberal bias (Trump: â€œ The media is rigged against usâ€? ).\nBy contrast, liberal Democrats such as Sen. Bernie Sanders are more prone to argue that the process is corrupt because rich people buy elections. Minor party candidates like the Greensâ€™ Jill Stein also often regard ballot access as unfair , reducing genuine choice for voters at the ballot box. Moreover, the allegation that electoral officials are unfair is heard among candidates from all parties, whether because of the imposition of strict photo ID requirements that are thought to restrict voterâ€™s rights or because of overly lax security thought to allow disqualified citizens to register and vote.\nEvidence shows that those who question the integrity of the voting process are far less likely to participate. Thatâ€™s clear in the graph below.\nAmong Americans in the 2012 ANES survey who believe that votes are â€œvery oftenâ€? counted fairly, over three-quarters (77 percent) reported that they voted. By contrast, among those with strong doubts about this process, just two-thirds (64 percent) bothered to vote, generating a net 13-point gap.\nWhen asked whether they thought that electoral officials were fair, similar patterns can be observed, where greater trust is significantly associated with higher voter turnout. None of the other claims about electoral malpractice was observed to have a similar effect on turnout, including problems of media bias, lack of genuine choice and campaign finance.\nOf course, itâ€™s difficult to figure out which way the causal arrow goes ? do people stay home because they donâ€™t trust the election, or are people who donâ€™t vote simply more likely to hold anti-establishment views? Regardless, cynicism about the electoral process and turnout are negatively related.\nQ: â€œIn your view, how often do the following things occur in this countryâ€™s elections?â€? (Very often, fairly often, not often, or not at all often?) Votes are counted fairly. Electoral officials are fair. Source: 2012 American National Election Study N. 5452\nWho stays home?\nBut will the Trump-Pence strategy actually serve to depress turnout among Hillary Clinton supporters? Data from political scientist Charles Stewart suggests that Trumpâ€™s talk of a rigged election is actually making Democrats more confident in the electoral system. Other data point to the fact that Trumpâ€™s claims of vote rigging might backfire and damage his own support.\n[ Donald Trumpâ€™s rigged election talk is changing minds. Democratsâ€™ minds, that is. ]\nFirst, the polls clearly show that it is Republicans, not Democrats, who are more likely to believe the Trump claims of alleged malpractices. It may be his own supporters who are most likely to be discouraged from voting.\nIn September 2016, a Gallup poll found that only 6 in 10 Americans were very or fairly confident that their vote would be accurately cast and counted in the U.S. election, down from around three-quarters of all Americans a decade earlier . But among Republicans, the proportion who were confident dropped to around half, the lowest which the Gallup poll has ever recorded on this question when asked in a series of surveys. Other polls have found that Trump voters are especially likely to believe that voter fraud occurs often.\nTrumpâ€™s talk may also make it more difficult for him to mobilize independents, whom he needs to expand his base, who typically have low turnout, and who are often deterred from voting by claims of unfairness.\nQ: â€œIn your view, how often do the following things occur in this countryâ€™s elections? Votes are counted fairly.â€? (Very often, fairly often, not often, or not at all often?)\nSource: 2012 American National Election Study N. 5452\nOverall, therefore, Trumpâ€™s charges of rigged elections in this campaign are factually inaccurate, highly damaging for trust and confidence in U.S. elections and democracy, and potentially corrosive for voting by his own supporters. Even worse, his claim that he may or may not accept the legitimacy of the outcome if he loses is simply un-American and doubtless welcome by dictators around the world who express similar sentiments when they lose.\nPippa Norris ?is the McGuire Lecturer in Comparative Politics at the ?John F.

As he took the stage here in this mountain town Friday afternoon, Donald Trump was as subdued as the modest crowd that turned out to see him. He complained about the usual things ? the dishonest media, his â€œcorruptâ€? rival Hillary Clinton ? but his voice was hoarse and his heart didnâ€™t seem in it.\nHe also promised to do all that he could to win, but he explained why he might lose.\nâ€œWhat a waste of time if we donâ€™t pull this off,â€? Trump said. â€œYou know, these guys have said: â€˜It doesnâ€™t matter if you win or lose. Thereâ€™s never been a movement like this in the history of this country.â€™ I say, it matters to me if we win or lose. So Iâ€™ll have over $100?million of my own money in this campaign.â€?\nâ€œSo, if I lose,â€? Trump continued as the crowd remained unusually quiet, â€œif I lose, I will consider this ?â€?\nTrump didnâ€™t finish his sentence, but he didnâ€™t really need to. After weeks of controversy and declining poll numbers, Trump and his campaign have settled into a dark funk. Even as he vows to prevail in the race, the GOP nomineeâ€™s mood has soured with less than three weeks to go until Election Day.\nWatch Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump make jokes at the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York on Oct. 20. (The Washington Post)\nHis final debate performance this week was a bust, with him snarling that Clinton was â€œsuch a nasty womanâ€? and gritting his teeth as he angrily ripped pages off a notepad when it was over. He is under fire from all quarters for refusing to say he will honor the election results if he loses, while 10 women have now come forward accusing him of groping or kissing them without consent. The capper to Trumpâ€™s bad stretch came Thursday night, when a ballroom full of New York Cityâ€™s glitterati booed him as he gave remarks attacking Clinton at a charity roast.\n[ At charity roast, Trump delivered what might as well be a campaign eulogy ]\nThe gloomy mood has extended to his signature rallies, which Trump used to find fun. During the primaries, he would bound onto rally stages bursting with energy and a sense of excitement that intensified as the crowds chanted his name and cheered his every word. He would regularly schedule news conferences, call into news shows and chat with reporters, eager to spar with them. He would say politically incorrect things and then watch his polling numbers soar. He used to be the winner.\nBut no more. In recent days, Trump has tried to explain away his slide in the polls as a conspiracy carried out by the media, Democrats and Republicans. If he loses, it will be because he was cheated, Trump has repeatedly told his supporters, urging them to go to polling places in neighborhoods other than their own and â€œwatch.â€?\nTrumpâ€™s supporters have concocted elaborate explanations for why he might lose, often involving massive voter fraud conducted by Democrats who will bus undocumented immigrants and people posing as people who have died to battleground states to vote illegally. There are also fears that election results in some states will be tampered with, and Trumpâ€™s backers have cheered his promise to challenge the election results if he doesnâ€™t win.\nâ€œSince we canâ€™t check to see if you voted in three states, you will. If you want to vote in three states, you will,â€? said Larry Lewis, 67, a former electrician who lives in Hendersonville, N.C.. He said he doesn't know anyone who has committed voter fraud but has gotten up to speed on the issue thanks to talk radio. â€œI mean, that is human nature. I have ultimate faith in human nature.â€?\nCampaigning Friday in Cleveland, Clinton again criticized Trump for refusing to say he will honor the election results and joked about her time onstage debating him. â€œI have now spent 41/2 hours onstage with Donald, proving once again I have the stamina to be president,â€? she said.\nWatch Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton make jokes at the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York on Oct. 20. (The Washington Post)\n[ GOP braces for Trump defeat, rushes to protect down-ballot seats ]\nAfter the debate Wednesday night, Trump flew to Ohio for a Thursday rally. He abruptly walked out of two local television interviews before taking the stage in front of a smaller-than-usual crowd. After it was over, he was back at the Columbus airport, slowly plodding up the steps to his personal jet. He was alone, holding a black umbrella as a light rain fell.\nHours later, Trump sat with his wife at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner to participate in the long-standing tradition of political candidates roasting each other. The dinnerâ€™s chairman, Alfred E. Smith IV, set the tone for the evening as he lashed Trump in a series of cutting jokes.\nTrump went first, and his opening lines landed with such heavy bitterness that it prompted scattered, uncomfortable laughter.\nâ€œA special hello to all of you in this room who have known and loved me for many, many years. Itâ€™s true,â€? Trump said as he took command of the lavish dais, wearing a white tie and a black jacket that he kept tugging at.\nâ€œThe politicians,â€? he continued. â€œTheyâ€™ve had me to their homes, theyâ€™ve introduced me to their children. Iâ€™ve become their best friends in many instances. Theyâ€™ve asked for my endorsement, and they always wanted my money, and even called me really a dear, dear friend, but then suddenly decided when I ran for president as a Republican, that Iâ€™ve always been a no-good, rotten, disgusting scoundrel. And they totally forgot about me.â€?\nOver the next 15 minutes, Trump joked about the size of his hands and the size of his rivalâ€™s rally crowds, then compared himself to Jesus. He said the debate the night before had been called â€œthe most vicious debate in the history of politics,â€? prompting him to reflect, â€œAre we supposed to be proud of that?â€?\nHe joked about prosecuting Clinton if he gets elected president, accused the media of working for her and brought up the FBIâ€™s investigation into Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server while secretary of state.\n[ At third debate, Trump wonâ€™t commit to accepting election results if he loses ]\nâ€œHillary is so corrupt, she got kicked off the Watergate Commission,â€? Trump said, citing a false Internet rumor as the crowd turned on him and started to boo, something that simply doesnâ€™t happen at lavish charity dinners at the Waldorf Astoria hotel. The face of one the guests sitting on the stage behind him was struck with horror.\nâ€œHillary believes that itâ€™s vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private,â€? Trump said, as the booing intensified. Trump would go on to accuse Clinton of â€œpretending not to hate Catholicsâ€? and mock the Clinton Foundationâ€™s work in Haiti.\nAt one point, he wondered aloud whether the crowd was booing him or Clinton, to which someone in the crowd answered: â€œYou!â€?\nAs Clinton took her turn, Trump sat at a table decorated with pale roses and white orchids with his arms tightly folded.\nâ€œDonald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four, maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair,â€? Clinton said, as the crowd laughed and former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani mouthed, â€œWhat?â€?\nTrump, his arms folded, cocked his head to the side and smirked as his wife looked elegantly pained.\nA few minutes later, Clinton poked Trump for his praise of Russian President Vladi?mir Putin: â€œMaybe you saw Donald dismantle his prompter the other day, and I get that. Theyâ€™re hard to keep up with, and Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s even harder when youâ€™re translating from the original Russian.â€?\nTrump smiled and rocked in his seat, his face turning slightly red.\nClinton recognized former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, saying it was a shame he didnâ€™t speak, because â€œIâ€™m curious to hear what a billionaire has to say,â€? referring to disputes about Trumpâ€™s actual net worth.\nAnd she gave a shout-out to Trumpâ€™s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, saying: â€œSheâ€™s working day and night for Donald, and because sheâ€™s a contractor, heâ€™s probably not even going to pay her.â€? Conway, who has become subtly critical of her boss, quoted Clinton in a tweet and wrote, â€œA shout out from @HillaryClinton at #AlSmithDinner.â€?\nAs Clinton finished speaking, she received a standing ovation from many in the crowd. Trump clapped, then briefly stood, then sat down again, as if unsure what to do. Lip-readers caught him telling her that she did a good job.\nAs the dinner ended, Trump shook hands with some of the others on the stage, while a line of people wanting to talk with Clinton grew. After a few minutes, Trump and his wife made their way toward the exit.\nBefore ducking out, Trump flashed the crowd a thumbs up.\nAbby Phillip in Cleveland contributed to this report.\npolitics\nNews and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11.\npost_newsletter353\n	washingtonpost	World
1023051	https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/policy-prescriptions-clinton-and-trump-on-education/2016/10/24/222c39de-99b8-11e6-b552-b1f85e484086_story.html	Policy Prescriptions: Clinton and Trump on education	2016-10-28 00:00:00	Got it\nBy Associated Press October 24\nWASHINGTON ? A quality education for all students, especially young children, is something Hillary Clinton has been talking about for decades. Itâ€™s mostly new territory for Donald Trump, who more recently has been touting his education ideas beyond his oft-repeated criticism of Common Core.\nThe Republican presidential nominee added plans for education to his still relatively thin roster of policy proposals last month, unveiling an effort to spend $20 billion during his first year in office to help states expand school choice programs.\nTrump wasnâ€™t shy about his intentions, debuting his ideas at an inner-city charter school in Cleveland as part of a new outreach to minority voters. â€œThereâ€™s no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our government-run education monopoly,â€? Trump said at the school, blaming the Democratic Party for having â€œtrapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools.â€?\nTrump said his approach would create â€œa massive education marketâ€? and produce better outcomes than the nationâ€™s existing public education system. He also wants states to divert another $110 billion of their own education budgets to support school choice efforts, providing $12,000 to every elementary school student living in poverty to attend the school of their choice.\nClintonâ€™s education plans, meanwhile, are firmly rooted in improving the countryâ€™s public schools. The Democratic nominee has called for new spending to add computer science programs and refurbish crumbling buildings. â€œIâ€™ve been in schools in our country and inner cities and rural areas that I wouldnâ€™t send any child to. I mean they are falling apart, thereâ€™s mold on the walls, thereâ€™s rodents ? it is disgusting,â€? she said this month in Pennsylvania.\nHere is a summary of their proposals:\n___\nSCHOOL CHOICE\nTRUMP: The billionaire businessman has embraced a concept popular among conservatives, which calls for students and their parents to be able to select the school they wish to attend ? public, private, charter or magnet. Trump proposes spending $20 billion in his first year for block grants to states, and directing them to use the money to help millions of elementary school students living in poverty attend the school of their choice. That money â€œshould follow the students,â€? a concept known as portability. Critics of school choice argue that approach would deprive public schools of money, and Congress rejected the idea in the education law it passed last year.\nCLINTON: Clinton has voiced support for charter schools, which operate with public money but are governed by an independent â€œcharterâ€? rather than a communityâ€™s established public education system. But Clinton does not back the broader concept of school choice. â€œI want parents to be able to exercise choice within the public school system ? not outside of it, but within it ? because I am still a firm believer that the public school system is one of the real pillars of our democracy and it is a path for opportunity,â€? she said in November 2015.\n___\nSTUDENT LOANS AND DEBT\nTRUMP: He has decried the impact on college students of debt from loans, but beyond his promise to create jobs as president, he has not offered a concrete proposal to address what he called â€œone of the biggest questionsâ€? he gets from people in college. Trump has criticized the federal governmentâ€™s student loan program for making a profit, telling The Hill newspaper in July 2015 â€œthatâ€™s probably one of the only things the government shouldnâ€™t make money off. I think itâ€™s terrible that one of the only profit centers we have is student loans.â€?\nCLINTON: She has proposed that students from families making less than $125,000 a year be able to attend a public college or university in their home state without having to pay tuition, and that all community colleges be tuition-free. Under her plan, students with existing student loan debt would be able to refinance, and Clinton promises a three-month moratorium on payments to allow those in debt to take steps to reduce their monthly payments. Those deemed â€œentrepreneursâ€? would get a three-year deferment on their loans â€œso that student debt and the lack of family wealth is not a barrier to innovation in our country.â€?\n___\nCOMMON CORE\nTRUMP: The academic standards adopted in more than 40 states are a frequent target of Trumpâ€™s ire. â€œWe spend more by far, and weâ€™re doing very poorly. So, obviously, Common Core does not work,â€? he said last month. Trump has promised to do away with the standards if elected, which could prove a challenge: They were created and adopted by states, not the federal government.\nCLINTON: The standards are not mentioned in Clintonâ€™s education plans, although her campaign does note that as the first lady of Arkansas, she chaired the stateâ€™s education standards commission. Speaking in Iowa during the primary season, Clinton lamented what she called the â€œreally unfortunate argumentâ€? about the standards. â€œIt wasnâ€™t politicized,â€? she said. â€œIt was to try to come up with a core of learning that we might expect students to achieve across our country, no matter what kind of school district they were in, no matter how poor their family was.â€?\n___\nEARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION\nTRUMP: Trump has not discussed early childhood education.\nCLINTON: She would seek to make preschool universal for all 4-year-old children within 10 years of her election by providing new federal dollars to states. Clinton also seeks to double the number of children enrolled in Early Head Start, a government program that provides early education services to low-income families. Clinton has not detailed in depth on how she would pay for these expanded efforts.\n___\nTEACHER PAY\nTRUMP: He supports merit pay for outstanding teachers and wants to end teacher tenure that â€œrewards bad teachers.â€?\nCLINTON: Sheâ€™s pledged to start a national campaign to â€œelevate the profession of teaching.â€? Clinton would invest in training and support, including better pay. She also wants new teachers to be able to refinance student loans, with any remaining debt after 10 years to be forgiven.\nEDITORâ€™S NOTE _ One in an AP series examining the policy prescriptions offered by the major candidates for president.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Dimitry Kiselyov told his millions of viewers, â€œis the only country in the world that really can turn [the] USA into radioactive ash.â€?

In the same program, he again featured photographs of Obama. Kiselyov said that there had been a â€œradical changeâ€? in the U.S.-Russian relationship, and he added a threat: â€œMoscow would react with nerves of steelâ€? to any U.S. intervention in Syria ? up to and including a nuclear response. â€œIf it should one day happen, every one of you should know where the nearest bomb shelter is.

But this time around, the language sounds different. We are in the middle of an ugly presidential election. More important, we have a Republican presidential nominee who regularly repeats propaganda lines lifted directly from Russian state media. Donald Trump has declared that Hillary Clinton and Obama â€œ founded ISIS ,â€? a statement that comes directly from Russiaâ€™s Sputnik news agency. He spouted another debunked conspiracy theory ? â€œthe Google search engine is suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clintonâ€? ? soon after Sputnik resurrected it.\nNow Trump is repeating Kiselyovâ€™s threat , too. â€œYouâ€™re going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton,â€? he said this week. Just like Kiselyov, he has also noted that Russia has nukes and ? perhaps if Clinton is elected ? will use them : â€œRussia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk.â€?\nWhy is Russian state media using such extreme language? And why is Trump repeating it? The Russian regimeâ€™s motives arenâ€™t hard to understand: It wants to scare Russians. The economy is much weaker than it was, living standards are dropping and with it support for President Vladi?mir Putin. A ruling clique that stays in power thanks to violence and corruption is by definition nervous, and so it is using its media monopoly to frighten people: Only Putinâ€™s regime can protect you from U.S. aggression.\nThe regime surely wants to scare us, too, and persuade us to abandon Syria. If the United States and Europe throw in the towel, then Russia will be free to help the Bashar al-Assad regime impose the same kind of â€œsolutionâ€? that Russia used in Chechnya more than a decade ago: kill tens of thousands of people, flatten the landscape, destroy all political alternatives and then start again, with a Russian-backed dictator. In the interim, the war has its uses: It has increased the destabilizing flow of refugees to Europe, broadening political and economic chaos that Russia believes serves its interests.\nThe Russians also have a major interest in our election. Since last summer, when Russian hackers tried to spoil the Democratic National Convention with leaked emails, itâ€™s been clear that Russia prefers the Republican nominee, a man who has repeatedly stated his admiration for Putin and his dislike of U.S. allies. From personal experience, the â€œpolitical technologistsâ€? who design the regimeâ€™s information campaign know that fear and hysteria can persuade people to vote for an authoritarian candidate. It costs them almost nothing to try to create fear and hysteria in the United States. It might not work ? but it might pay off big.\nThere is one more possible motive. Whatever the outcome on Nov. 8, political uncertainty will follow: the months of transition, a change of White House staff, perhaps even the violent backlash that Trump may incite. This could be an excellent moment for a major Russian offensive: a land grab in Ukraine, a foray into the Baltic states, a much bigger intervention in the Middle East ? anything to â€œtestâ€? the new president.\nIf thatâ€™s coming, Putin needs to prepare his public to fight much bigger wars and to persuade the rest of the world not to stop him. He needs to get his generals into the right mind-set, and his soldiers ready to go. A little nuclear war rhetoric never fails to focus attention, and Iâ€™m sure it has.\n	washingtonpost	World

Dionne Jr. October 28 at 3:29 PM Follow @EJDionne\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\nWhen this election is over, can we acknowledge that at least one big debate in American politics is settled? I am referring to the question of whether our two parties have moved equally far away from the political center, or whether the polarization in our politics is asymmetric.\nThe very fact of Donald Trumpâ€™s nomination should be seen as proof that the Republicans have strayed much further from middle-ground opinion. Advocates of the theyâ€™re-both-the-same view should finally throw in the towel.\nOne party, the Democrats, nominated the mainstream or â€œestablishmentâ€? choice: Hillary Clinton. The Republicans chose Trump. In the popular vote in the Democratic primaries, Clinton won 55 percent against Bernie Sanders. In the Republican primary, Trump won 45 percent , while Ted Cruz, nobodyâ€™s idea of a middle-of-the-road politician, came in second with 25 percent. In other words, more than two-thirds of the Republicans who voted in primaries cast their ballots for the two candidates who most distanced themselves from moderation.\nThat should be case closed, and in recent days, new data has come along to show that the Republicans really are way out there when it comes to attitudes toward the political system itself. What is a more basic question than the matter of whether our electoral process is assumed to be on the level? Trumpâ€™s insistence before a single vote is counted that the election is â€œrigged,â€? and the fact that so many rank-and-file Republicans agree with him, shows how extreme a large chunk of the Republican electorate has become.\nThe plainest evidence comes from an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll conducted October 20. Pollsters asked respondents: If their candidate lost the election, would they accept the result? Among Republicans, 45 percent said they would be unlikely to?or definitely would not accept the result. Among Democrats, only 16 percent said the same. The gap defines asymmetric polarization.\nAn ABC News poll released October 23 found that 59 percent â€œof likely voters â€¦ reject Trumpâ€™s suggestion that the election is rigged in Clintonâ€™s favor, and more, 65 percent, disapprove of his refusal to say whether heâ€™d accept a Clinton victory as legitimate. Most strongly disapprove, a relatively rare result.â€?\nBut the parties did not respond in the same way. When ABCâ€™s analysts broke down the results by party, they found that only 23 percent of Republican likely voters â€œsay [Trump is] trying to make excuses in case he loses, rather than raising a legitimate concern; this view swells to 57 percent among independents and 91 percent among Democrats.â€? Again: asymmetry.\nI am not neutral here. I have long insisted that the polarization in our politics is asymmetric and have championed the pioneering work of my friends and colleagues Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein.\nIn my book â€œWhy the Right Went Wrong,â€? I cited data showing that, while 59 percent of Democrats preferred politicians who â€œmake compromises with people they disagree withâ€? over those who â€œstick to their positions,â€? only 36 percent of Republicans made the same choice. I also noted that there far more Republicans who call themselves conservative than there are Democrats who call themselves liberal.\nMann and Ornstein made the definitive case in their 2012 book â€œItâ€™s Even Worse than It Looks,â€? in which they bravely challenged the easy â€œboth parties are the sameâ€? assumption. Here is a summary of their view from an article they published in The Postâ€™s Outlook section:\nâ€œThe GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise;?unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition. When one party moves this far from the mainstream, it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the countryâ€™s challenges.â€?\nWhen you think about it, this is a rather good description of what Trump has done to the 2016 presidential campaign.\nLet it be emphasized that no one denies Democrats are more liberal now than they were when the party included Southern segregationists before the civil rights era. And the proportion of Democrats who identify as liberal is on the rise, partly because millennial voters constitute the most progressive generation since the FDR-era cohort and are a growing part of the Democratic coalition. But it needs to be stressed again that Republicans are still far more uniformly conservative than Democrats are liberal ? and as the Trump experience shows, far more likely to gravitate toward extreme positions.\nAfter this election, Republicans need to face up to what the rise of Trump means for their future. But political analysts need to take a lesson from the Trump experience, too. Itâ€™s not partisan to say that polarization is asymmetric. If you are willing to look at the evidence provided by Republican voters themselves, you have to conclude that it is a simple description of fact.\nopinions\n	washingtonpost	World

That's little changed from a 48-44 split in Friday's?results, but a substantial tightening since last weekend when Clinton led by a wide margin.\n[ See Clinton and Trump support among key voting groups ]\nA clear 59 percent majority continues to expect Clinton to win on Nov. 8, including more than 9 in 10 Clinton supporters, although the survey finds few signs that overconfidence is dampening enthusiasm. Among likely voters, only 2 percent who support Clinton and expect her to win say their prediction makes them less motivated to vote, including just 1 percent of those who think she will win "easily."?A similarly small 2 percent of Trump supporters who anticipate he will win say their expectation makes them less likely to vote.\nClinton's campaign has expressed concerns about complacency this week as it pushes supporters to turn out even as polls showed her with a comfortable lead.\n[ Read full Post-ABC Tracking Poll results ]\nNational polls released this week have shown ranging sizes of Clinton's advantage. Surveys by? Fox News and Investor's Business Daily/TIPP each found Clinton up a narrow three percentage points among likely voters, while she led by nine points in separate CNBC and USA Today/Suffolk polls and by 14 points in an Associated Press-GfK poll . The varying results come as polls capture reactions to a slew of news events, including ranges of enthusiasm among each candidate's supporters and unity among Republicans who have wavered in support for Trump.\nThe up-and-down campaign received another jolt with Friday's news that the FBI is looking into additional Clinton emails from her time as secretary of state, an issue about which the public has been especially critical of Clinton. A September Washington Post-ABC News poll ?found 62 percent the public overall?disapproving of her handling of questions about email while secretary of state, including 48 percent who disapproved strongly.\nThe survey finds little sign of a large engagement advantage among Democrats or Republicans at this point ??62 percent of registered voters in both groups say they are following the race "very closely," and 88 percent in each group say they are "absolutely certain to vote" or volunteer they have already cast their ballot.\nLikely voters who support Trump are less confident that he will win than Clinton, with two-thirds (66 percent) predicting he will prevail while 22 percent think Clinton will win and the rest are uncertain. Yet nearly 7 in 10 Trump supporters say their expectations for the outcome make them motivated to turn out (69 percent), including a similar 77 percent of those who think he will win. Just over one-quarter of all Trump voters say expectations don't make a difference in their vote, while 2 percent say it makes them less likely to show up.\nClinton supporters are slightly less apt to say their expected outcome makes them more motivated to vote, 61 percent, while 37 percent say it doesn't make a difference and 2 percent say they're less energized to vote as a result.\nThe presidential race has been prone to sharp swings following major campaign news, with less stability than during President Obama's reelection run in 2012. Trump's victory in the Republican primary boosted him to a narrow three-point edge over Clinton in May, his best of the year, but he lost ground in June after sharp criticism of a judge's Mexican heritage and his controversial response to the Orlando shootings.\nClinton's lead expanded after the party conventions in late August and negative reactions to Trump's dispute with a Gold Star family, but the race narrowed to a dead heat leading up to the first debate in late September, before Clinton's lead grew again after she was seen as winning that encounter. Last weekend, tracking results released by ABC News found Clinton with her largest lead of 12 points following a week in which Trump was seen as losing the third debate and mocking women who accused him of sexual assault.\nThe latest Post-ABC News tracking poll finds an electorate lining up in very similar ways to four years ago. Clinton holds a 51-to-41 lead among women while Trump leads by 49-to-42 among men, a similar split as between Obama and Mitt Romney in in 2012. Non-white likely voters overall favor Clinton by 51 percentage points, smaller than Obama's 61-point edge, while whites tilt toward Trump by a 16-point margin (just shy of Romney's 20-point lead).\nTrump leads by a wide, 82-12 percent margin among white evangelical protestants, slightly wider than Romney's 78-21 advantage in 2012. Clinton dominates among voters with no religious affiliation, leading by more than 3 to 1 (66 to 18 percent), a similar edge as?Obama in 2012 (70-26).\nThe one clear shift from 2012 is a sharp educational split among whites that has been tracked all year. Whites with college degrees favor Clinton by double digits (53-41), while non-college-educated whites favor Trump by more than 30 points (62 to 28). The split was far smaller in 2012, when Romney won both groups: white college grads by 14 points and non-college grads by 25.\nThis Washington Post-ABC News poll was conducted by telephone Oct. 24-27, among a random national sample of 1,779 adults including landline and cellphone respondents. Overall results have a margin-of-sampling error of plus or minus 2.5 points; the error margin is plus or minus three points among the sample of 1,148 likely voters.

He was 82.\nHis death was confirmed by his biographer, Sylvie Simmons. Other details were not immediately available.\nMr. Cohen began his career as a well-regarded poet and novelist before stepping onto the stage as a performer in the 1960s. With his broodingly handsome looks and a deep, weathered voice that grew rougher and more expressive with the years, he cultivated an air of spiritual yearning mixed with smoldering eroticism.\nMr. Cohen never had a song in the Top 40, yet â€œHallelujahâ€? and several of his others, including â€œSuzanne,â€? â€œFirst We Take Manhattanâ€? and â€œBird on the Wire,â€? were recorded by performers as disparate as Nina Simone, R.E.M. and Johnny Cash. His lyrics were written with such grace and emotional depth that his songwriting was regarded as almost on the same level as that of Bob Dylan ? including by Dylan himself.\nMr. Cohen was named to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, but his incantatory, half-spoken songs were more in the tradition of the European troubadour than the rock star. Lyrics were paramount to Mr. Cohen, but whether he was composing songs, poetry or fiction, there was always an underlying musical pulse.\nLeonard Cohen performing at New Yorkâ€™s Madison Square Garden in 2012. (Mike Lawrie/Getty Images)\nâ€œAll of my writing has guitars behind it,â€? he said, â€œeven the novels.â€?\nA character in Mr. Cohenâ€™s 1963 novel â€œThe Favorite Gameâ€? said, â€œI want to touch people like a magician, to change them or hurt them, leave my brand, make them beautiful.â€? In 1966, he published another novel, â€œBeautiful Losers,â€? that became a best seller.\nThe same year, after an informal audition at New Yorkâ€™s Chelsea Hotel, Mr. Cohen was signed as a singer-songwriter to Columbia Records by John Hammond, the talent scout who had promoted the careers of Count Basie, Billie Holiday, Dylan, Aretha Franklin and Bruce Springsteen.\nAt first Mr. Coehn was a reluctant performer. He often needed alcohol or drugs to go on stage early in his career. He labored over his songs, refining them as if he were polishing gems. He spent five years on â€œHallelujah,â€? which appeared on his 1984 album â€œVarious Positionsâ€? and is generally acknowledged as his masterpiece. Like much of his music, it took years to gain a popular foothold.\nA 1994 recording by Jeff Buckley found a niche, and over time it was recorded by at least 300 artists. K.D. Langâ€™s performance of â€œHallelujahâ€? formed the centerpiece of the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\nIt was difficult for critics to explain exactly what made Mr. Cohenâ€™s music so memorable and moving. The lyrics were poetic, of course, but his musical settings were ingenious, with shifting chords and deceptively simple melodies.\nHis music â€œwas very intimate and personal,â€? singer-songwriter Suzanne Vega told the New Yorker. â€œLeonardâ€™s songs were a combination of very real details and a sense of mystery, like prayers or spells.â€?\nLeonard Cohen in 2012. (AFP/Getty Images)\nHis first song to pierce the public consciousness was â€œ Suzanne ,â€? which became a minor hit for Judy Collins in 1966 and was later performed by Simone and others. The song, written about one of Mr. Cohenâ€™s many girlfriends, is on one level a simple love song:\nAnd you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind\nAnd you know that she will trust you\nFor youâ€™ve touched her perfect body with your mind\nBut Mr. Cohen broadens the lyrics to included references to Jesus walking on water before referring to the hidden heroes in life:\nThere are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning\nThey are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever\nWhile Suzanne holds her mirror\nIn one of Mr. Cohenâ€™s most direct songs, â€œIâ€™m Your Man,â€? he issued a direct plea, saying he was willing to do anything he could to win a womanâ€™s love. The song appeared in the late 1980s, but it gained added poignance in his later years, when an aging Mr. Cohen delivered the lyrics in a deep croak that was vulnerable, yet strangely compelling:\nIf you want a lover\nIâ€™ll do anything you ask me to\nAnd if you want another kind of love\nIâ€™ll wear a mask for you\nIf you want a partner, take my hand, or\nIf you want to strike me down in anger\nHere I stand\nIâ€™m your man\nPerhaps no song encapsulated so many of Mr. Cohenâ€™s characteristic strengths as a songwriter as â€œHallelujah.â€? The tuneâ€™s rising melodic line even figures in the lyrics as â€œthe fourth, the fifth / the minor fall, the major lift.â€?\nThe lyrics have been subject to endless interpretation over the years, as they weave through religious references, sexuality and personal confession:\nYour faith was strong but you needed proof\nYou saw her bathing on the roof\nHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya\nShe tied you\nShe broke your throne, and she cut your hair\nAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah\nIn the 1980s, Dylan often performed â€œHallelujahâ€? in concert. In the New Yorker last month, Dylan, who recently was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, explained he found Mr. Cohenâ€™s songs so powerful.\nâ€œHis gift or genius is in his connection to the music of the spheres,â€? Dylan told New Yorker editor David Remnick. â€œ â€˜Hallelujahâ€™ has resonance for me. There again, itâ€™s a beautifully constructed melody that steps up, evolves, and slips back, all in quick time. . . . These are all great songs, deep and truthful as ever and multidimensional, surprisingly melodic, and they make you think and feel.â€?\nLeonard Norman Cohen was born Sept. 21, 1934, in Montreal. His family was prominent in the cityâ€™s Jewish community, founding a synagogue and owning several clothing and manufacturing businesses. He was 9 when his father died.\nâ€œI have a deep tribal sense,â€? Mr. Cohen told the New Yorker magazine last month. â€œI grew up in a synagogue that my ancestors built. I sat in the third row.â€?\nHe undertook various religious studies and spiritual pursuits throughout his life, but he remained grounded in the Jewish tradition, sometimes using Hebrew phrases and traditional melodies in his music.\nAs a teenager, Mr. Cohen admired blues music and the French-language singers Jacques Brel and Edit Piaf. He was a member of a country-and-Western band in Montreal, but his interests were primarily literary. He graduated from Montrealâ€™s McGill University in 1955, with a bachelorâ€™s degree in English. He won a writing prize in college and published his first volume of poetry in 1956. He later moved to New York, where he studied briefly at Columbia University and read his poetry in coffee shops.\nHe often found himself in odd places at odd times. In 1961, he was in Cuba during the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion. He wrote a poem about the experience, called â€œThe Only Tourist in Havana Turns His Thoughts Homeward.â€?\nHe lived in London before impulsively traveling to Greece in 1960 and ended up buying a house on the island of Hydra. It was there that he met and fell in love with a married Norwegian woman named Marianne Ihlen.\nShe divorced her husband, and they lived together for several years. Ihlen, who was often described as Mr. Cohenâ€™s muse during the 1960s, died in August.\nMr. Cohen also had well-known relationships with Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell and actress Rebecca De Mornay.\nâ€œMy reputation as a ladiesâ€™ man was a joke,â€? he said. â€œIt caused me to laugh bitterly through the 10,000 nights I spent alone.â€?\nIn the 1970s, he had two children with his common-law wife, Suzanne Elrod. Survivors include Adam Cohen and Lorca Cohen, both of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.\nMr. Cohen spent years at a Zen Buddhist monastery in California and did little performing during the 1990s. He lived off his royalties until discovering in 2004 that his business manager and onetime lover, Kelly Lynch, had made off with millions of dollars.\nDuring a subsequent trial, Mr. Cohen testified that Lynch was stalking him with repeated phone calls and messages, despite a restraining order. She was later sentenced to 18 months in prison, but Mr. Cohen did not recoup his lost money.\nAs a result, he was forced to embark on concert tours and new recordings, which marked a remarkable late-career renaissance. He released nine albums after turning 70, most with newly written material. In 2008, he began a tour with a full band and backup singers that took him all over the world. Dapper and dignified, he wore a dark suit and a hat ? â€œI was born in a suit,â€? he said ? and performed for as long as four hours at a time, leaving audiences enchanted.\nMr. Cohen carried a notebook in his pocket to write down lyrics and sometimes used his smartphone to record musical ideas. He sometimes drew inspiration from unlikely sources. A story he read about Holocaust victims performing music in concentration camps led to the heart-wrenching song â€œ Dance Me to the End of Love â€?:\nDance me to your beauty with a burning violin\nDance me through the panic till Iâ€™m gathered safely in\nTouch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove\nDance me to the end of love\nA documentary about his life, â€œLeonard Cohen: Iâ€™m
 Your Man,â€? was released in 2005. His last concert performance came in 2013, but he continued to write and record songs at a home studio in Los Angeles until shortly before his death. A new album, â€œYou Want It Darker,â€? appeared last month.\nâ€œI did my best, it wasnâ€™t much,â€? he sang in â€œHallelujahâ€?:\nI couldnâ€™t feel, so I tried to touch\nIâ€™ve told the truth, I didnâ€™t come to fool you\nAnd even though\nIâ€™ll stand before the Lord of Song\nWith nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah\n	washingtonpost	World

On talk shows all across the continent, anchors and experts cited numbers that average citizens were?still more likely to drown than to be killed in an attack.\nThe message of European authorities and leaders was and continues to be: The attacks won't change the way we go about our daily lives. But they did.\nWithin months, Europe had turned into an anxious continent. It was what the Islamic State had hoped for, terrorism researchers warned.\nEven now, almost 50 percent of the French population thinks about the Paris attacks once a week. About half of all French believe it would be worth giving up some civil liberties to stop future attacks.\nEurope was not the only continent affected by the Islamic State, of course.\nIn total, the group?has killed thousands of civilians across the globe since that day in November; hundreds have died in the West in attacks that dominate headlines for days, but many more have died in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia as the group's footprint dwindles in Iraq and Syria.\nWhat Europe did not know at that point back in November was that?attacks would soon resume there, as well.\n[ How terrorism in the West compares to terrorism everywhere else ]\nEurope under attack: The new state of normal??\nIn the U.S., the Islamic State claimed responsibility for a June attack on a gay nightclub in Florida that killed 49 people. In Europe, at least 30 people were killed in Brussels in March in two attacks, a suicide attack at a metro station and a double suicide attack at the Brussels airport. And in July, 86 people were killed in Nice when an Islamic State attacker plowed a?truck through throngs of people on a busy promenade at the city's?Bastille Day festival.\n"ISIS has specifically called for its supporters to use any means conceivable to cause as much devastation as possible," said Rachel Bryson, a researcher who focuses on religion and geopolitics. "The nature of these kind of attacks make them hard to prevent, they are sporadic and use objects that can be easily sourced."\nA woman places a bouquet of flowers in Nice, France, July 15, 2016. (REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol)\nTo Europeans, it is a disturbing new state of normal. When Kristen Gunderson, a D.C. native living in Nice, was finally able to leave the building from where she had watched the Bastille holiday fireworks in July, more than 80 dead people lay on the street in front of her. An empty baby carriage was standing on the street.\nIn July, there was little left of the unity people in Paris and Brussels had shown months earlier. Days later, France's national motto â€œliberty, equality, fraternityâ€? blinked on an illuminated traffic sign ? but next to it, residents had enraged conversations whether all Muslims were to blame for the attack.\n"The other times, there had been?a lot of support. There was less of that support this time,â€œ Gunderson said in a phone interview.\n[ The mile-long site where a truck hit hundreds in Nice, France ]\nEurope's flawed?security measures\nWhen the Paris attacks started on Nov. 13, Europe had struggled for almost two years already to find an appropriate response to a growing problem. At that time, thousands of Europeans had already joined the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.\nThe countries most affected were bigger ones such as France, Germany and Britain. Measured by how many recruits per capita left for Syria and Iraq, however, Belgium, Denmark and Austria also ranked on top.\nAs the Islamic State is now edged out of its strongholds in Iraq and parts of Syria, European leaders are bracing for a possible overflow of fighters back to Europe. Hundreds of fighters are already believed to have returned.\n[ E.U. authorities brace for wave of Islamic State fighters after Mosul assault ]\nA little-noticed leak of documents recently documented hundreds of fighters who came back to Europe as early as 2014. The Islamic State appears to have kept track of the details of some the returning fighters, including reasons for the departure.\nMeanwhile, European intelligence agencies still struggle to keep up.?The number of arrests has risen sharply, but many returnees have so far escaped punishment, partially due to a lack of evidence of what exactly they did in Syria or Iraq.\n"There still is?no police force which is allowed to conduct investigations across?European borders," said Nils Duqet, a Brussels-based?researcher.?For many European agencies, the November attacks in Paris were nevertheless a wake-up call. Previously, they had mostly refrained from even sharing data on foreign fighters.\nThat changed after one of the key suspects, Belgium-born Salah Abdeslam, was able to escape?despite being stopped at a police control in France following Nov. 13. Much of Europe is part of the so-called Schengen area?without border controls. A benefit for tourists and business travelers, it?has also enabled militants to easily move between countries.\n?\nThe Schengen area also facilitates illegal weapons trafficking. "Smugglers?enter the European Union through Slovenia or Croatia. The moment they?cross that border,?there are?basically no obstacles anymore on the way to Western Europe."\nWithin Europe, flaws in the security apparatus have caused rifts.?"If you look at the recent attacks you will see that there were clues," said Sir David Omand, a former director of British intelligence service GCHQ who developed Britain's counter-terrorism strategy. "If the British way?of collecting and analyzing had been in place all over Europe,?then perhaps some of those attacks would have been prevented," he said, implying that other countries
 should learn from Britain.\n[ The ISIS apocalypse has been postponed but the militants might still believe in it ]\nAmid the absence of a coordinated European counter-terrorism strategy, the Islamic State's methods in Europe follow a systematic pattern aimed at creating religious tensions. It's a strategy that appears to have worked : Unfavorable views of Muslims are on the rise across Europe.\nThe Islamic State also deliberately?attracts members and recruits who would not be accepted by other militant organizations. By doing so, the group?has attracted so many sympathizers in Europe that it has become impossible for law enforcement agencies to track all or even most of them.\nFrance, for instance, would need all of its police officers to monitor all terrorism suspects in the country 24/7. "There are too many suspects to monitor them?using traditional methods," said Omand.\nPerhaps as worrisome, many ISIS fighters used to be petty or violent criminals. They may pose the biggest threat to Europe, experts say.\n"There is a lot of cooperation between criminals and radicals here in Belgium," said El Boudaati Moad, a social worker who tries to prevent youths from joining ISIS. "Former criminals who return to Europe are particularly dangerous because they can rely on a network to buy weapons or make bombs. It's a disturbing combination."\nExperts say that "lone-wolf'"?attacks are disturbingly easy to carry out -- and cheap. "It is sufficient to have a normal salary or to receive unemployment benefits to pay for it,"?explained?Tom Keatinge, the director of London's?Center for Financial Crime and Security Studies.\nBelgian social worker Moad had an equally pessimistic prediction for the future: "There will be more attacks."\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

Nov. 13, 2015, has already gone down as the darkest day in French history since World War II, when 130 people were killed here in an Islamic State assault on daily life: a concert, a soccer game and cafes.\nThe attack on Parisâ€™s Bataclan concert hall ? where 90 of the victims died ? and several restaurants in a young, lively neighborhood was only the beginning. In the 12 months since, the same terrorist cell behind the Nov. 13 attacks also struck a Brussels subway and airport, and a lone wolf inspired by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, drove a truck through crowds gathered in Nice, France, during a national holiday.\nAnother lone-wolf attacker murdered a French police officer and his partner in the presence of the coupleâ€™s 3-year-old child, live-streaming the gruesome incident on Facebook. Little more than a month later, two other attackers slit the throat of an 85-year-old village priest, in the middle of a weekday mass. In almost every case, the attackers were fellow French or European passport-holders content to murder their fellow citizens.\n[ A year after Paris attacks, Europeâ€™s extremism problem shows no signs of going away ]\nThese assaults by homegrown terrorists have created a backlash against Muslims ? Franceâ€™s largest minority group ? that views them as a threat to national security and strikes at the heart of one of the nationâ€™s most sacred virtues: the ideal of fraternity.\n1 of 74\nThe deadly Paris attacks in 2015\nView Photos\nMore than 120 died in a coordinated terrorist assault across the French capital on Nov. 13, 2015.\nCaption\nMore than 120 died in a coordinated terrorist assault across the French capital on Nov. 13, 2015.\n? An undated handout photograph made available by the Belgian Federal Police, April 8, shows Mohamed Abrini who was arrested by Belgian officials. Abrin is a key suspect from last yearâ€™s terrorist attacks in Paris. EPA\nBuy Photo\nWait 1 second to continue.\nBut one group in particular has mobilized to defend that sense of fraternity threatened by the young terrorists. As unlikely as it is diverse, that group is made up of those who survived the Nov. 13 attacks and family members of those who died.\nIn the year since the attacks, a surprising number of them have published books and made art in response to their grief. While each tells a different personal story, all share the same general message: Hatred is unacceptable.\nThis message has made Antoine Leiris an instant celebrity in France. His wife, HÃ©lÃ¨ne ?Muyal-Leiris, 35, was killed in the Bataclan concert hall last year, where she had gone to attend the Eagles of Death Metal concert that night. In a Facebook post shortly afterward that went viral, Leiris directly addressed his wifeâ€™s killers: â€œYou will not have my hate,â€? he said.\nThose words now form the title of a memoir he has published in France and the United States that appeared last month.\nIn an interview, he said writing was a means of self-preservation in the midst of a tragedy that not only left him without a wife but also left their 17-month-old son, Melvil, without a mother.\nâ€œAfter the attacks, the moments of writing were moments of escape,â€? Leiris said. â€œWords for me are little magnificent things that carry something immense in them. Itâ€™s words that permitted me at once to understand reality at the same time as departing it.â€?\nYet his message was always clear: Any sort of revenge is beside the point. â€œThe only thing that matters is that sheâ€™s no longer here,â€? Leiris writes in his book. â€œGuns, bullets, violence ? all of this is just background noise to the real tragedy now taking place: absence.â€?\nOn the street outside the reopened Bataclan music venue, Parisians tell The Washington Post their thoughts on the one-year anniversary of the Islamic State attacks that killed 130 people at a concert, a soccer game and cafes. (The Washington Post)\nIt might be even more surprising that Fred Dewilde, 50, agrees. Dewilde was inside the Bataclan on Nov. 13, trapped on the floor as the terrorists fired rapidly into the crowd. He responded by writing a graphic novel that details his experience in the siege, trying to help a young woman next to him only to emerge drenched in her blood.\nHis book, â€œ My Bataclan ,â€? also published last month, is especially firm in its rejection of Islamophobia. France, he wrote, should not use the attack as an excuse to â€œfall fearful of the scarf, the dark one or the Other.â€?\n[ Franceâ€™s top administrative court overturns burkini ban ]\nPressed to elaborate, Dewilde went further, referencing the unlikely rise of the National Front party after the attacks, once considered unthinkable. â€œFrance is changing and taking the worst possible policy path,â€? he said in an emailed statement. â€œI feel that many Americans must feel that today with the election of [Donald] Trump. A shame of being human. A fear of what France is. A fascist country.â€?\nFinally, there is Danielle MÃ©rian, 78 ? â€œGranny Danielle,â€? as the French have come to call her. Neither victim nor survivor, she was just a neighborhood resident who insisted on French television after the attack that it was essential to â€œbe friendly to Muslims, who practice their religion freely and kindly.â€?\nHer comment transformed her into something of an unlikely mascot for the Muslim community in the middle of a tense political moment. â€œIt was important to reach out to Muslims,â€? she said, â€œbecause they were the first victims of ISIS.â€?\nThe French governmentâ€™s struggle to implement security improvements in the year since the attacks has coincided with a steady rise in Islamophobia on the right and the left, exacerbated by Europeâ€™s continued migration crisis. The far-right National Front, for instance, has wasted no time in calling Muslims a security threat, while the Socialist government has portrayed them as an affront to Franceâ€™s secular values. Either way, the implication is the same: Franceâ€™s largest minority group does not belong.\nThis is something MÃ©rian will not entertain.\nInstead, she has a book of her own, â€œ We Have Not Stopped Loving ,â€? which she sees as something of a modern retelling of Ernest Hemingwayâ€™s classic celebration of 1920s Paris, â€œ A Moveable Feast .â€?\nâ€œFor me, that was the perfect response,â€? she said. â€œIn my neighborhood, all the cafes and restaurants are open, and we have begun to live again.â€?\nMÃ©rian reiterated that by â€œweâ€? she means everyone: â€œFraternity,â€? she said, â€œis the only solution.â€?\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

Kuczynski said.\nThe Peruvian president cited the recent U.S. election, though he did not specifically mention President-elect Donald Trump, who pledged to overhaul the countryâ€™s trade policy and tear up trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nKuczynski also cited the vote in June by Britain to leave the European Union as evidence that â€œprotectionist tendencies are taking overâ€? in the world.\nAPEC has brought more than 1,000 delegates from 21 countries to Lima for a forum aimed at easing global commerce.

New measures will also prohibit examiners from representing any financial firm before the regulator for one year and ban current Fed workers from talking about official matters with people who have left the agency within the last 12 months.

Gen. Michael Flynn, appointed national security adviser by President-elect Donald Trump, leaves Trump Tower in New York City on Friday. (Photo by Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)\nâ€œThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.â€?\n??????? Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty , April 4, 1949\n?\nThroughout the more than 60 years of its existence, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has only once invoked Article 5, the provision that calls for the signatories to defend one another ? follow the proper consultations ? if attacked. Only once.\nThe date was Oct. 3, 2001, three weeks after 9/11. By then it had been determined that the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon had been â€œdirected from abroad,â€? in the word of Lord Robertson, the NATO secretary general and a former British defense minister. He declared that the entire alliance would take collective active in response ? in defense of the United States.\nNATO duly created the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), one of the largest military coalitions in history. The force served in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014, and at its height it included 130,000 troops from four dozen nations . There were notably large British, Canadian, Dutch, Polish, German and French contingents, as well as contributions from NATO partners such as Georgia and Australia.\nMore than 1,000 non-American soldiers died fighting for ISAF in Afghanistan, and hundreds more were wounded. For many European countries, the Afghan war was the first military conflict that they had fought in since the Second World War. Their sacrifice has never been widely described or acknowledged in the United States, most of whose citizens remain unaware that it ever took place.\nYet they fought. Why? Out of loyalty to, and out of friendship for, the United States. Because European governments understood that al-Qaeda was threat to all of them. Because the North Atlantic Treaty was never just a military pact; it was a recognition of a common commitment to peace, security, the rule of law and freedom, as well as an acknowledgement of U.S. leadership, both political and military.\nUsually, I write my columns for the readers of The Washington Post. This one I am writing for the new administration, and especially for the man who may become the leader of the National Security Council, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.? He has complained ? as has every single U.S. president for the past two decades ? that not enough NATO countries were, as he put it, â€œpaying their bills.â€? But he went further: â€œWe continue to give, give, give and get nothing back in return.â€? He spoke of â€œcontractsâ€? and â€œreciprocityâ€? ?- as if NATO were a business transaction, not an alliance that has already sacrificed soldiers in the name of U.S. security.\nHe did not mention NATOâ€™s role in Afghanistan. He did not acknowledge that for many Europeans, the experiences of that war as well as the war in Iraq ? which, as a war of choice, did not lead to the invocation of Article 5, although many Europeans fought ? were not positive. Those wars are remembered as poorly conceived, costly and worse: The Iraq War is now blamed for the Syrian war, which has led to the worst refugee crisis since 1945.? Flynn did not mention that although NATO expanded to include Central Europe in the 1990s, the United States did not hold any exercises in the region until 2013, now leaving it very vulnerable to a Russia that has rebuilt its military and uses it as a threat.\nFlynn was right about one thing: NATO needs a major overhaul. I once hoped, wistfully, that President Obama might use his last years in office to revitalize the alliance, even that he would browbeat recalcitrant members into investing more. But such a project can only succeed on the basis of mutual respect and commitment, and with the understanding that the United States also benefits ? economically, politically and in other ways ? from its transatlantic military leadership. Such a project cannot succeed if carried out with arrogance, by a man who does not seem to know the history of the alliance at all.\nopinions\n	washingtonpost	World

(Darko Vojinovic/AP)\nA Russian fighter jet crashed in the Mediterranean Sea while trying to land on?Russiaâ€™s sole?aircraft carrier, which is stationed off the Syrian coast, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Monday in a statement.\nThe plane went down several miles from the carrier, the Admiral?Kuznetsov, according to the Defense Ministry. The pilot ejected and was recovered.\n[ How Russiaâ€™s lone aircraft carrier will change the fight in Syria ]\nâ€œThe health of the pilot is not in danger. The pilot is ready to carry out orders,â€? the Defense Ministry said.\nEarlier in the day, Pentagon officials said they had indications that the Russians had lost a plane, and Fox News ? quoting intelligence officials ??reported that the aircraft, a MiG-29K, went down after appearing to have?mechanical issues shortly after takeoff. The Pentagon tracks Russian and Syrian government aircraft activity with airborne sensors and thermal-imaging satellites.\nRussian news outlets reported Saturday that Russian jets had begun operating?from the Kuznetsov in an effort to bolster Russiaâ€™s year-old air campaign over Syria and that they could participate in a final blitz to help Syrian troops retake the city of Aleppo. Videos posted to social media confirmed the reports, with footage showing silhouettes of MiG-29s over Idlib province.\nIt is unclear why the aircraft crashed; landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier is extremely difficult, even for the best-trained pilots. Russiaâ€™s carrier-based air wing is relatively inexperienced compared with its U.S. counterparts, and its deployment to the Syrian coast appears to be a combat operation?and a?testing ground for some of its capabilities, including the addition of new MiG-29Ks to its inventory.\nWhile land-based versions of the MiG-29 have been around since the 1980s, the MiG-29K underwent limited testing?during the Cold War and was built in only modest quantities?by Russia in the early 2000s. According to news reports , the MiG-29Ks were added to the Kuznetsovâ€™s carrier wing this summer.?Specifically designed to handle the rigors of carrier operations at sea, the MiG-29K boasts?modest improvements over some of its?older variants.\n[ Russian warships to bypass Spanish refueling port, as NATO pledges to bolster its defenses ]\nAside from the handful of?MiG-29K and MiG-29K/KUBs aboard the Kuznetsov, the Russian carrier also has a contingent?of Su-33 air-to-air fighters and a mixture of helicopters that provide search-and-rescue capabilities and help with air traffic control.\nAs Russiaâ€™s lone aircraft carrier and the Russian navyâ€™s flagship, the Kuznetsov is often derided for its age and propensity for mechanical troubles. Its ramped deck and lack of a catapult system mean that jets such as the MiG-29K and Su-33 cannot take off fully loaded with fuel and munitions.

With a hail of missile strikes, Russian forces announced a major offensive Tuesday against rebel-held areas in Syria. As the assault unfolded, activists in the crucial city of Aleppo said that their skies were filled with government warplanes and that bombs were raining down.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that it had used its sole aircraft carrier ? ordered last week to the Mediterranean Sea in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ? for the first time and that missiles had also been fired from a land-based system inside Syria as well as another Russian warship off the coast.\nActivists said the Russian targets appeared to include eastern Aleppo, one of the last urban bastions of factions opposing Assad. But Moscow denied involvement in the attacks on the city, saying it has been nearly a month since Russian forces launched strikes there.\nThe divided city has become the epicenter of the battle for Syria.?The governmentâ€™s recapture of Aleppo could hasten the fall of remaining rebel strongholds across the country.\nRussiaâ€™s assault kicked off just hours after Putin and President-elect Donald Trump, speaking by phone,?agreed to combine efforts in Syria to defeat what Moscow has said is its enemy in the fight:?â€œinternational terrorism and extremism.â€?\nThe Obama administration has been aiding what it sees as moderate opponents of Assad while continuing the fight against al-Qaedaâ€™s Syrian affiliate, which in some places has been battling alongside the rebels.\nRussia describes all rebel groups as?â€œterrorists,â€? and Trumpâ€™s blanket statements about joining Russia have been seen in Moscow as tacitly supporting this view.\n[ Aleppoâ€™s elders fear they will die alone ]\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei?Shoigu said â€œmassive strikesâ€? were waged against positions of the Islamic State and an al-Qaeda-linked militant group in Idlib and Homs provinces. The regions are north of Damascus and include rebel-held zones but do not cover Aleppo.\nShoigu told Putin in a meeting in the Russian city of Sochi that Su-33 jets were launched from the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov and that the frigate Admiral Grigorivch? launched cruise missile strikes .\nShoigu said the attacks targeted industrial sites used by rebel forces to make toxic substances used as a â€œserious means of mass destruction.â€? The Russian claims could not be independently verified.\nIn August, a team of international inspectors determined that the Syrian government and Islamic State militants were responsible for chemical attacks carried out in 2014 and 2015. Syria denied the findings and, in turn, has claimed that rebel forces and other militants have waged chemical attacks.\nThe United States condemned the renewed attacks and said they had struck civilian targets. â€œThe most recent reported attacks are on five hospitals and one mobile clinic in Syria. We believe itâ€™s a violation of international law,â€? State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said Tuesday in Washington.\nIn Aleppo, civilians and rebel fighters said missiles and barrel bombs struck targets across at least five neighborhoods in the cityâ€™s rebel-held east, an area controlled by anti-Assad fighters.?The White Helmets civilian rescue group said it documented more than 100 attacks, some involving cluster munitions.\n[A cease-fire gave Aleppo a respite from war. It was brief .]\nThe military balance in Aleppo has become a bellwether for the state of Syriaâ€™s war.\nWhen rebel forces captured the cityâ€™s eastern districts in 2012, they appeared ascendant, boasting that a march on Damascus would be next. Four years later, the area they control lies in ruins, and opposition fighters have been outgunned by Russian, Syrian and Iranian firepower.\nImages shared on social media from east Aleppo on Tuesday showed men and children searching for survivors in the wreckage of a shattered building. The casualty count was not immediately clear.\nSyrian state television said the strikes hit what it called â€œterroristâ€? strongholds and supply depots. But residents said many of the bombs struck homes.?The claims also could not be independently verified.\nIn the city of Homs, the assault appeared to have involved incendiary weapons. Photographs from al-Waer ? an area of the city where the Syrian government is trying to force rebels to surrender ? seemed to show several charred bodies.\nRussia has promised an all-out offensive to retake Aleppo, giving fighters and civilians a sunset deadline earlier this month to leave rebel-held districts.

As Syrian government airstrikes pounded eastern Aleppo on Wednesday, people huddled around incubators in the basement of the cityâ€™s only remaining childrenâ€™s hospital, waiting in silence as they counted the bombs.\nBy midday, they said, the tally had passed 20, shaking the ground and shattering equipment in the rooms above. Speaking from their underground refuge, the hospitalâ€™s director said he and his staffers were trapped.?\nThe attacks continued as night fell, marking the second day of a major offensive to retake Aleppoâ€™s eastern districts from armed opposition groups. Defeat in Aleppo, once Syriaâ€™s economic powerhouse, would be a major blow to the rebels. It could also hasten the fall of their remaining strongholds across the country.\n[ Russian warships join the Syrian battles ]\nThe offensive came a day after government forces and their Russian allies resumed attacks across northern Syria, including Russian cruise missile strikes from a warship in the Mediterranean.?\nThe White Helmets rescue group said at least 87 people were killed Wednesday in Aleppo province. The number is expected to rise significantly as attacks intensify and underequipped medical facilities struggle to cope.\nâ€œThe planes are up above. We canâ€™t get out,â€? said the childrenâ€™s hospital director, who gave his name as Hatem. â€œWeâ€™ve been hit before, but this isnâ€™t like the other times. Every mother is holding her child. We canâ€™t control things anymore. The parents want to protect their children by themselves.â€?\nResidents said eastern Aleppoâ€™s central blood bank, located close by, also was hit. Video footage showed the aftermath of the fierce bombardment. Fires licked the edges of cars and buildings, and the air was filled with dust.?\nThe Independent Doctors Association, a nonprofit group that supports the childrenâ€™s hospital, said it was badly damaged.\nWhen they finally left the basement under cover of darkness, staff members at the childrenâ€™s hospital found that the bombing had given way to shelling. And as nurses ushered patients back to their beds, the doctors prepared for a long night ahead.?\nâ€œWeâ€™re safe, but we have to tidy up now. This will only happen again,â€? said Hatem, the director.?\nIt was at least the ninth such attack on a medical facility in opposition-held areas nationwide in three days. The United States on Tuesday condemned the previous attacks, calling them violations of international humanitarian law.\nTempers fray at the State Department as a spokesman is pressed on claims of Russia bombing hospitals in Syria. (Reuters)\n[ Trumpâ€™s administration could upend the Middle East ]\nThe bombardment ended a period of relative respite, particularly in eastern Aleppo, where Moscow halted airstrikes on Oct. 18 ahead of brief cease-fires. Although residents were ordered to leave for their own safety, few did so. Many expressed fears about what awaited them outside.\nRussia said Tuesday that it had launched a major offensive against rebel-held areas in Idlib and Homs provinces, but it denied involvement in the new attacks on Aleppo.\nIn Moscow, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said Russian warplanes have â€œcarried out no strikes against the city of Aleppo for 29 days now,â€? according to the Interfax news agency.\nThe city of Aleppo has been split into the government-held west and the rebel-held east since 2012 along one of the most intractable front lines of the war. Eastern Aleppo is surrounded by an array of government-allied forces ? including Syrian troops and Iran-backed militias ? and supply routes have been cut.?\nThe United Nations said last week that aid workers in the area had handed out the last of their food supplies. Few families manage three meals a day, and many go to bed hungry.\nâ€œWeâ€™re suffering from the most basic needs. Thereâ€™s not even fuel for ambulances,â€? said Najmaldin Khaled, 30, a student. â€œRussia has given the green light to attack Aleppo again, and thereâ€™s no solution for us on the horizon.â€?\nOn Wednesday, the state-owned TV channel Ikhabariyah reported large troop deployments along several fronts in Aleppo. It claimed an assault was imminent and â€œzero hourâ€? would soon begin.\nThe Syrian and Russian governments have framed the fight against the armed opposition groups as a war on terrorism. In an interview with Portuguese television that aired Tuesday, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad suggested that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could be a â€œnatural allyâ€? of the Damascus government if he is â€œgenuineâ€? about fighting â€œterroristsâ€? in Syria.\nBut the government attacks have repeatedly targeted civilian infrastructure, often areas where moderate rebel factions operate. Assadâ€™s troops have also laid siege to dozens of towns and villages, adopting a policy toward civilians that the United Nations has labeled â€œsurrender or starve.â€?\nSyriaâ€™s conflict has killed an estimated half-million people and touched off the largest refugee crisis since World War II.\nSyriaâ€™s rebellion began in 2011 with peaceful protests, but it is increasingly dominated by extremist factions, including al-Qaeda-linked Jabhat Fatah al-Sham.?\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, said Wednesday that Russian airstrikes have resumed in Idlib, a province where the faction, formerly called Jabhat al-Nusra, operates among civilians and other rebel groups.?\nSherif al-Khalaf, a journalist from the region, said the bombing had struck 34 areas since Tuesday, killing six and wounding dozens. â€œThe damage is immense, and people are frightened,â€? he said.?\nHeba Habib in Stockholm and David Filipov in Moscow contributed to this report.\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

Rescue workers pulled bodies from damaged buildings across eastern Aleppo on Saturday as the White House condemned the Syrian governmentâ€™s â€œheinousâ€? attacks on the area.?\nThe White Helmets rescue group said that at least 61 people were killed as forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stepped up attacks on Aleppoâ€™s rebel-held districts for a fifth day.?\nDoctors inside the city said that treatment options for the seriously wounded were running out after the Omar bin Abdul Aziz Hospital, one of a dwindling pool of medical facilities, appeared to have been the target of bombing raids. Doctors Without Borders said it was the 30th attack on an eastern Aleppo hospital since government-allied forces besieged the area in July.?\nIn a statement Saturday, ?Susan E. Rice, President Obamaâ€™s national security adviser, condemned the attacks â€œin the strongest terms,â€? adding that â€œthere is no excuse for these heinous actions.â€?\nAssadâ€™s government says that retaking Aleppo ? divided since rebel forces captured its eastern districts in 2012 ? is now a military priority. But it denies bombing civilian targets, insisting that attacks have focused solely on forcing the armed opposition to surrender.?\nâ€œThere is no severe bombing on civilians,â€? Ali Haidar, Syriaâ€™s minister for reconciliation, said in an interview Friday. â€œMilitary actions are executed on the places where the leaders of the rebel gangs are.â€?\nBut rescue workers say that at least 289 civilians have also been killed. Hospitals, homes and graveyards have not been spared, either.\nIn one video, shared Friday by local doctors, a father is inconsolable, stroking the unruly curls of his son as the child is laid in a body bag. In another, a young girl lies silent as nurses wash a wound caused by a tank shell.\nRussia and the United States have overseen several brief ?truces intended to encourage civilians and surrendering rebels to leave eastern Aleppo, but few have done so.\nHumanitarian convoys have been unable to enter eastern Aleppo since July, and aid workers there distributed the last of their food more than a week ago. Jan Egeland, a humanitarian adviser with the United Nations, said Friday that rebel groups had agreed in theory to allow aid into the area.?â€œWe wait for green light from Russia and GoS,â€? he said, using an acronym for the Syrian government.\nWith warplanes constantly in the skies, residents spoke last week of terror and fatigue. Confined to their homes, many learned of the deaths through their Facebook feeds.\nâ€œItâ€™s really hard to be far away from the Internet for 8 hours,â€? wrote one man as he returned online. â€œYou get back to see that you have lost a friend and another has buried his father in the cemetery.â€?\n?Read more:\n	washingtonpost	World

Dr. Ahmad Tarakji is president of the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS). Laila Soudi works with SAMS and the psychiatry department at the Stanford University School of Medicine.\nToday, more than 250,000 Syrians remain trapped in besieged eastern Aleppo with limited access to food, clean water and medical supplies. Living under constant aerial bombardment, residents in the eastern part of the city have nowhere to go. Eastern Aleppo is expected to run out of food and medical supplies in 20 days or less, after which we risk losing more than a quarter-million people to mass starvation and restricted access to lifesaving medical care.\nOf the quarter of a million people stuck in Aleppo, 100,000 are children. These children cannot eat or sleep without incapacitating fear. Every day, they experience unparalleled levels of trauma and anxiety, making them an especially vulnerable group with only 29 doctors remaining to care for them and their families. Our doctors are faced with the unimaginable task of having to decide which child to save and which to let die due to the severe shortage of medical supplies and staff. Furthermore, we do not have the infrastructure in place to provide those who survive with mental-health services to alleviate their severe trauma symptoms. Instead, we let them leave our hospitals in anguish and despair, knowing we helped rescue them from underneath the rubble and provided medical care for them in our hospitals but also knowing we cannot alleviate their fear. We are all afraid. We work knowing that the next child we help may be our own.\nOur children in Syria deserve a better future. They deserve dignified medical and mental-health care. They deserve to go to school and play with their friends without fear.\nWe have to work together immediately to help the people of Aleppo. This is not a divisive political appeal to a single party; the White Helmets affirms its stance to help everyone regardless of their ethnicity, religion or political affiliation inside Syria. The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) affirms the same stance to help internally displaced Syrians as well as refugees in neighboring countries and beyond receive the medical care they deserve. This appeal we are making is a human one. We are calling on the international community to stand with us now and in solidarity with the people of Aleppo.\nWe must all come together and place pressure on our governments to lift the siege on besieged areas especially in rural Damascus, Homs and, in line with the U.N. Security Council resolution, all other regions across Syria and allow for food and medical supplies to enter immediately. We are asking you to mobilize, place pressure on your governments and demand that the people of Syria be granted the supplies they urgently need.\nCall your political representatives immediately. Organize on the streets. Demand that action be taken. We have less than 20 days, and the time to act is now. Help us help them.\nopinions\n	washingtonpost	World

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says that airstrikes struck three neighborhoods. It had no immediate word on casualties. (Syrian Civil Defense- White Helmets via AP, File) (Associated Press)\nBy Associated Press November 16\nBEIRUT ? The Latest on the conflict in Syria (all times local):\n12:10 a.m.\nFranceâ€™s U.N. ambassador says attacks against medical facilities in Syria by the government and its allies â€œare war crimes.â€?\nFrancois Delattre strongly condemned renewed airstrikes targeting three hospitals in Syria since Monday and killing more than 30 people in Aleppo, including children.\nHe told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York that the situation in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria is getting worse every day.\nâ€œMake no mistake about it,â€? Delattre said. â€œBombing Aleppo and its population is not fighting against terrorism, as the regime pretends. ...What the regime and its allies are doing in Aleppo is actually fueling terrorism, itâ€™s fueling radicalization.â€?\nHe urged increased political pressure to send â€œa clear message to the regime and its allies that they must stop their indiscriminate attacks against Syrian people and be accountable.â€?\n___\n10 p.m.\nA spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group says Syrian Kurdish forces are leaving the town of Manbij after training local fighters to defend it.\nAir Force Col. John Dorrian said Wednesday that the trainers were in the process of leaving after assisting the Manbij Military Council. Kurdish-led forces drove IS from the town earlier this year.\nTurkey, which sent troops into Syria this summer, had threatened to move into Manbij if the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces didnâ€™t leave. Turkey views the Kurdish forces as an extension of the insurgency raging in its southeast.\nA local Manbij commander, Shervan Darwish, said the last 100 elite fighters from the Kurdish Peopleâ€™s Protection Units left the town Tuesday.\n___\n7:25 p.m.\nSyrian opposition activists say an airstrike in the northern Aleppo province has killed at least 18 people, including six women.\nActivists in Batbo village posted the names of the 18 online after Wednesdayâ€™s airstrike. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says at least 19 were killed, including seven women and three children, many from the same families.\nRussia announced a major offensive in opposition-held areas on Tuesday, and Syrian President Bashar Assadâ€™s air force has been pounding Aleppo city. It was unclear who carried out the airstrike in Batbo.\nThe Observatory, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, says the toll is likely to climb.\nIbrahim al-Haj, a member of the Syrian Civil Defense, a group of volunteer first responders, says 22 were killed in the air raid, which struck mud houses in the village. Conflicting accounts of casualties are common in the chaotic aftermath of airstrikes.\n___\n11:40 a.m.\nTurkeyâ€™s president says Turkish-backed Syrian opposition forces are facing resistance from Islamic State fighters but are close to taking the Syrian town of al-Bab from the extremists.\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan also told reporters Wednesday that U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters ? which Turkey views as terrorists because of their affiliation to Kurdish rebels in Turkey ? would soon leave the town of Manbij, in keeping with a U.S. promise to Turkey.\nErdogan said the opposition fighters were some 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from al-Bab.\nâ€œThe siege is going according to plan,â€? Erdogan said. â€œThere is a resistance there at the moment but I donâ€™t think it will last long.â€?\nAnkara sent ground forces into northern Syria in August, vowing to clear the border area of both IS and Syrian Kurdish militias.\n___\n11:15 a.m.\nSyrian President Bashar Assad says U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could be a â€œnatural allyâ€? to the Damascus government in its grinding civil war.\nIn an interview published Tuesday with the Portuguese state TV channel, Assad said his government would need to see if the incoming administration is â€œgenuineâ€? about fighting â€œterroristsâ€? in Syria.\nInternational observers say Syrian and allied Russian forces regularly strike hospitals, schools, and other civilian infrastructure in opposition-held areas, against international law. Assad maintains he is fighting terrorism.\nIn the run-up to last weekâ€™s presidential election, Trump said he was ready to work with Assad to fight against the Islamic State group in Syria.\nMore than 300,000 people have been killed in the 5-1/2 year-long Syrian civil war.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The large U.S. military base that dominates this village 30?miles north of Kabul was shut tight as a drum Sunday, with no Afghan workers allowed inside in the wake of a suicide bombing the day before.\nThe U.S. Embassy also shut down except for emergency services for the first time since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, in what officials called a temporary precautionary measure.\nHundreds of Afghans normally work at the sprawling military base, in the kitchens and laundry and on cleaning and construction crews. But after an attacker, identified by Afghan officials as a base worker, managed to kill four Americans and wound 17?others inside the compound, the gates were shut.\nAmerican officials have released few details of the attack and no information about the victims other than their nationalities, but Afghan security officials said Sunday that they had identified the attacker as a poor local laborer and former Taliban fighter. They said he had worked at the base â€œfor some timeâ€? after formally returning to civilian life through a government reintegration program.?\nExperts and officials in Kabul worried that the attack ? only the second time a suicide bomber has penetrated a U.S. military compound during the war ? could reinforce American concerns about troop safety and lead the incoming Trump administration to pull out the remaining 10,000 U.S. service members in the country.\nThe bombing came two days after Taliban insurgents rammed a suicide truck into the German consulate in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif. All consulate staffers were safely evacuated, but the powerful blast, followed by heavy gunfire from Taliban fighters, killed four Afghans and wounded 128. A Taliban spokesman said it was in retaliation for a deadly U.S. airstrike in Kunduz the previous week.?\nIn addition to closing Bagram to outside traffic, U.S. officials said that all U.S. and allied military facilities were adding extra security measures and fortifications. The temporary closing of the U.S. Embassy, State Department officials said in a tweet, was because of a â€œserious threat of violence, kidnapping and hostage taking.â€?\nAmerican officials also warned last week that insurgents were planning to attack the Serena Hotel, a fortified luxury establishment in Kabul, and a guesthouse in an affluent area of the city. The Serena was invaded in 2014 by Taliban gunmen who shot and killed nine civilians.\nThe Bagram base houses about 14,000 Americans, both military service members and private contractors, and serves as one of two major hubs for American military traffic in the country. It is heavily guarded but surrounded by a cluster of thriving villages and near a busy highway corridor in Parwan province. The region, which supplies most of the low-level workers who enter each morning and leave each evening, depends heavily on the base for economic support.\nTaliban statements Saturday named the bomber as a Taliban member, Hafiz Mohammad Parwani, and said he had been secretly planning the attack for the past four months while working on the base. On Sunday, Parwan police officials named the attacker as Qari Nayeb Parwani and also said he had been working as a laborer at the U.S. base. They said his family members had been arrested by Afghan intelligence police.\nâ€œThe identity of the bomber has become clear,â€? said Mohammad Zaman Mamozai, provincial police chief, in an interview. â€œBut we do not know how he succeeded to take explosives inside the base since security is tight all the time. We are surprised that he managed to conduct such an attack.â€?\nResidents near the base, including several who have regular jobs there, also expressed amazement Sunday that the bomber had found a way to sneak materials inside. One man said his former job was to help search Afghan workers and that each one had to undergo body searches and scans before entering.\nâ€œThey check everyone with scales and instruments. You couldnâ€™t even take a needle in there without it being found,â€? said the 23-year-old worker, who gave his name as Habibullah. â€œThere is no way an ordinary person could carry explosives inside. They would have to fly over the wall and jump in.â€?\nWith the base on total lockdown, Afghan workers said they had no idea when they would be allowed back. â€œNobody sent us a message, but the gate is shut and nobody can go in,â€? said a cafeteria worker who gave his name as Shamarai.?\nSeveral residents and storekeepers said that Bagram has been a good provider of business and security over the years but that the area has become more dangerous lately, with armed robbers and insurgents operating there. Afghan officials said Taliban groups are active in several areas of Parwan, once a stronghold of the main anti-Taliban militia.??\nBagram, the largest and best-known U.S. base in Afghanistan, has always been a high-priority target for the Taliban, and it has been attacked many times. In December, a suicide bomber riding a motorcycle killed six American service members patrolling outside the base. In 2007, a bomber struck an entry point to the airfield, killing two Americans and 21 others.\nThe U.S. military has suffered about 2,400 fatalities since 2001, when the Taliban regime was overthrown and later regrouped as an insurgency against the Western-backed civilian government.\nIn Saturdayâ€™s early-morning attack, the bomber detonated on a sidewalk near an exercise area where a group of men were getting ready to go running, U.S. military officials said. Other reports said there was a special race planned that day. The Taliban spokesman said the bomber had targeted a â€œsports groundâ€? where â€œmore than 100 military officers, important people and soldiers were busy exercising.â€?\nSayed Salahuddin and Sharif Walid contributed to this report.\nRead more\n	washingtonpost	World

Trump has chosen Priebus to be his White House chief of staff. (Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)\nFollowing Dave Chappelleâ€™s â€œSaturday Night Liveâ€? monologue in which he said he was going to give Donald Trump a chance, there was one other statement this weekend that makes me think I may want to do the same. In a â€œ60 Minutesâ€? interview last night filled with substantive news, a seemingly casual question from Lesley Stahl elicited a potentially revealing answer from Trump. Stahl, directing her query to Melania Trump, asked if she was prepared for the level of scrutiny and loss of privacy that being first lady entails. Mrs. Trump said â€œwe are used to it,â€? and then Donald Trump said, â€œIâ€™ve had a lot. But Iâ€™ve never had anything like this.â€?\nComedian Dave Chappelle made his hosting debut on "Saturday Night Live." Here are some of the highlights. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)\nTrumpâ€™s response hinted at a qualification for being a good president, one he has never shown: humility. Perhaps, the unique pressures and responsibilities of the job are starting to sink in and may help bring forth a more thoughtful version of himself. One can imagine an inner dialogue between two sides of his personality: the rogue candidate and a nascent, more responsible president. You can see this tension play out in his tweets; one trashing the protesters as protest-for-hire sore losers; another acknowledging their right to protest. Or in his comments after visiting President Obama in the Oval Office about keeping some provisions of Obamacare in place. (Never mind that policy experts all say you canâ€™t have some of the most popular benefits of the current law without its more unpopular ones.) And, perhaps, the two sides are on display in his choice of an?accommodationist, Reince Priebus, as chief of staff and bomb-thrower Steve Bannon as chief strategist.\nTrumpâ€™s attitude throughout his long march to the presidency was that the job would be easy for him. Recognizing it wonâ€™t is a good first step.\nopinions\n	washingtonpost	World

Chappelle said. â€œAnd we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.â€?\nComedian Dave Chappelle made his hosting debut on "Saturday Night Live." Here are some of the highlights. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)\nAnd lastly was SNL's â€œElection Nightâ€? sketch, in which a bunch of white liberals watch the results in real time with Chappelle ??and later, Chris Rock, who showed up midway through. Chappelle and Rock scoff at their disbelief that Trump might just win and the idea that this is the worst thing the country has ever done.\nThe sketch also includes the white liberals recalling their friends at left-leaning media outlets having assured them that Clinton would win.\nâ€œMy friend at the Huffington Post says she wins by five points,â€? Cecily Strong said.\nâ€œWell, I dunno,â€? Vanessa Bayer retorts. â€œMy friend at Slate says she'll win by three.â€?\nThen they chew over the ideas that Trump could win the popular vote but lose the electoral college and that there might never be another Republican president ? both hot takes from the media that proved very wrong by the end of the night.\nâ€œWord?â€? Chappelle responds. â€œYou ever been around this country?â€?\nHe adds at another point when they're talking about Clinton winning: â€œIt might be a historic night, but don't forget it's a big country.â€?\nWhich pretty much says it all.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	World

A statement issued late Friday by the Syrian opposition's Aleppo Health Directorate said that all hospitals in eastern Aleppo are out of service because of the bombing over the past days. (AP)\nBEIRUT -- These days, hospitals feel like the most dangerous places to be in east Aleppo, doctors say.\nThroughout the cityâ€™s rebel-held districts, medical facilities are in the Syrian governmentâ€™s crosshairs . The medical charity Doctors Without Borders has recorded 33 hospital attacks since the area came under siege in July, and the pace has only quickened.\nOn Monday, al-Bayan Hospital was hit, its?staff members choking on dust as they processed what had happened. The sound of the warplane had been clear. That they were its target was not.\nIn video footage from the attack's immediate aftermath, workers cried out for their colleagues as the air turned white.?\nâ€œThe ambulance driver, where is he?â€?\nâ€œHeâ€™s here.â€?\nâ€œIs anyone hurt?\nAn hour later, the?Omar Abdulaziz hospital was bombed, just as it was preparing to reopen from an earlier attack . â€œOur new maternity unit has been destroyed. We hadnâ€™t even used it,â€? said Farida Muslim, a gynecologist there.\nAs the Syrian government mounts an all-out offensive to retake east Aleppo, ?the health network there is makeshift, and easily movable.\nMost facilities operate out of basements to minimize the impact of airstrikes . When there is an attack, staff members jump into action, taking?everything they can grab below?ground or moving equipment to a safe location as colleagues stay behind to repair the damage.?Facilities forced out of action in a moment can be?back online within hours.\nBut as the government siege starts to bite -- no aid supplies have entered the city since July -- this process is becoming harder by the day. The underground facilities have a limited ?number of beds, and shrinking?staff numbers mean specialists must work at multiple hospitals to serve as many patients as possible.\nSupplies are also dwindling. Doctors make emergency trips to deliver drugs to sister hospitals, only to find that they need them again for their own patients. Equipment also requires backup fuel supplies, which are running out. "There are days when I feel like a useless repairman," said one doctor, speaking on the condition of anonymity because his hospital had told?him not to speak to the media.\n"One day I'm mending a child ripped by shrapnel, even though I know he could be back in my clinic tomorrow. The next day I'm picking up parts of my windows and I just feel they'll shatter again."\nIn the children's hospital -- bombed five times now -- doctors are getting used to scrambling to protect newborns already underground. On Friday, the staff shared photographs of babies placed on the floor of the basement, bundled together in blankets.\nGovernment bombing and shelling of east Aleppo in the past week have left more than 300 people dead and almost 1,000 injured. With the rise in hospital attacks, wounded?residents are opting to stay away from medical facilities, heading instead for nearby houses in the hope that a doctor will reach them there.\nFor Wissam Zarqa, an English teacher from Aleppo, this new practice led him to spend hours Monday accompanying a friend in search of his?father, thought to have survived a barrel bomb three days earlier.\n"We went to many houses where people have been moved," Zarqa said. "He couldn't find him and now he is looking for other houses where his father might be."\nAccording to Doctors Without Borders, what remains of east Aleppo's health system hangs by a thread.\n"The consequences of indiscriminate bombing are very clear," said Luis Montial, the organization's deputy head of mission. "What is not clear is how much longer the health system, already on its knees, can carry on.â€?\nHeba Habib in Istanbul contributed to this report.\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

Syriaâ€™s government hopes a brutal siege will vanquish rebel holdouts in the city of Aleppo, a key battleground. But Syrian President Bashar al-Assadâ€™s troops arenâ€™t leading the charge.\nThat task has been taken up by thousands of Shiite militiamen from Lebanon, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan who are loyal to Iran, a Shiite country and perhaps Assadâ€™s most important ally.\nFor much of Syriaâ€™s civil war, these religiously motivated fighters have reinforced Syriaâ€™s badly weakened military. Now, they are playing an increasingly critical role in trying to seize opposition-held eastern Aleppo by coordinating their attacks with government forces and warplanes flown by Russia, another ally of Assadâ€™s.\nThe government, backed by Russian aircraft, launched a major offensive across northern Syria last week that has brought further devastation to eastern Aleppo, Syriaâ€™s largest city before the war.\nThe militias appear to be forming a sophisticated ground coalition that has further bolstered Iranâ€™s influence in Syria, alarming even officials in Assadâ€™s government, said Phillip Smyth, an expert on Shiite militias at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\nâ€œThey are building a force on the ground that, long after the war, will stay there and wield a strong military and ideological influence over Syria for Iran,â€? he said. â€œAnd there is not much Assad can do to curb the rising influence of these groups, even though Syrian officials are clearly concerned about this, because the militiamen are literally preventing the overthrow of his government.â€?\nAnalysts say Iran has long used Shiite militias in other countries to project its power. The groups include multiple factions that dominate Iraqi politics, as well as the Lebanese Hezbollah militia, which is more powerful than Lebanonâ€™s military.\nIran and its militias have frustrated U.S. officials. While both sides find themselves aligned against the Islamic State in Iraq, they are at cross-purposes in Syria, where anti-Assad rebels receive funding and arms from Washington and its allies.\nEventually, analysts say, Iran could even find itself in direct competition with Russia for influence in Syria.\nThe Shiite militiasâ€™ presence in Syria also has fueled Iranâ€™s regional and religious rivalry with Saudi Arabia, a Sunni powerhouse that backs Syriaâ€™s Sunni-led rebellion.\nStill, the payoff of using militiamen could be substantial. If the Syrian government is able to seize all of Aleppo, the regional balance would tip in Iranâ€™s favor, dealing a blow to Saudi ambitions and the rebels who stormed the cityâ€™s eastern areas in 2012, said Fawaz Gerges, professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London School of Economics.\nâ€œA defeat of the rebels in Aleppo would be a turning point in which Assad captures most of the urban centers of Syria,â€? he said. â€œIt would be a setback for Saudi Arabia in its rivalry with Iran, which, as a result, would see its influence in Syria increase even more.â€?\nThe dozens of militias there have led the way in imposing a crushing blockade of the cityâ€™s opposition districts, where more than 200,000 people face worsening shortages of food and medicine. The fighters also call in air raids by Russian and government warplanes that have wrecked hospitals, residences and infrastructure in those areas.\n[ Darkness and fear as bombs rain down on Aleppo ]\nRebels have indiscriminately shelled government-held western Aleppo, but destruction there has not been as severe.\nThis month, rebel fighters in Aleppo launched a counteroffensive, but they have struggled to break the siege. Air power ? especially Russiaâ€™s ? has proved a formidable obstacle. The Shiite militiamen have, too, said Zakaria Malahfiji, a member of the Fastaqim rebel force, which is affiliated with the umbrella Free Syrian Army.\nâ€œThey are fighting with passion, and they fight in well-coordinated attacks,â€? he said. â€œI remember one battle where these fighters just kept dying in one spot. One guy would charge, get shot and die, and then another, and then another and then another would do the same thing on the exact same spot. All of them died. They are motivated.â€?\nPro-government forces show no sign of slowing their assault on the city, despite intensified efforts by the U.N. envoy to the war-torn country, Staffan de Mistura, to halt the fighting.\nOn Sunday, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem rejected a proposal by de Mistura that would have had rebel fighters withdraw from eastern Aleppo in return for calm. Moallem said retaking opposition neighborhoods there was a matter â€œnational sovereignty,â€? the Associated Press reported.\nâ€œWe agreed on the need that terrorists should get out of east Aleppo to end the suffering of the civilians in the city,â€? he said. Syrian officials refer to most, if not all, government opponents as â€œterrorists.â€?\nThe hard-line Sunnis of the Islamic State and other religious extremists have overshadowed the revolt against Assad that began peacefully in 2011 before turning into brutal war. Militants linked to al-Qaeda have played a prominent role among rebel forces.\n[ How the Syrian revolt went so horribly, tragically wrong ]\nTo the rebels, the Iranian-backed militiamen are extremists.\nâ€œThey are spreading Iranâ€™s influence and their extremist ideology, but our revolution is not about religion; itâ€™s about freedom and dignity,â€? said Abdulmunem Zaineddin, a religious scholar involved with rebel forces in the battles in Aleppo.\nThe militias say their involvement in the civil war is about defending Shiite shrines in the country, as well as battling extremist Sunni groups.\nâ€œWe donâ€™t want sectarian violence. We want to protect Syria, to protect all that is sacred to everyone from terrorism, from the terrorist groups paid for by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and the U.S.,â€? said Hisham Al Mossawi of Harakat al-Nujaba, a militia from Iraq whose fighters also are battling in Aleppo.\nItâ€™s unclear how many Shiite militiamen and militia factions are participating in the Aleppo battle. Hundreds and perhaps even thousands of the fighters have been killed during the war, including generals from Iranâ€™s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nAvi Dichter, chair of Israelâ€™s foreign affairs and defense committee, said this month that as many as 25,000 Shiite militants are fighting in Syria. Other analysts say the number is smaller.\nIsraeli intelligence closely monitors the fighting in Syria and, in particular, Hezbollahâ€™s role in the conflict. Since it fought a devastating war with Israeli forces in 2006, the Lebanese militia has become more powerful, partly because of the battlefield skills honed in Syria.\nHezbollah intervened in Syria early on in the war, helping Assadâ€™s forces rout rebels in key western areas of the country.\nâ€œThe fighting has made [Hezbollah] a better fighting force and more adept in conventional military warfare,â€? Dichter said.\nIn Aleppo, Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guards play prominent leadership roles, directing the foreign Shiite militiamen, many of whom are recruited by, and trained in, Iran.\nThe factions are learning to overcome issues such as linguistic differences, helping them become more adept at coordinating ground assaults, said Smyth, the analyst.\nâ€œHistory proves that whenever Iranians craft groups like these, such as Lebanese Hezbollah, they donâ€™t give up arms, they donâ€™t stand down and they donâ€™t leave territory that theyâ€™ve taken,â€? he said. â€œThey will be in Syria for years and years, and that will have consequences for everyone.â€?\nHeba Habib in Stockholm and Zakaria Zakaria in Istanbul contributed to this report.\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

(Associated Press)\nBy Associated Press November 21\nISTANBUL ? NATOâ€™s general secretary said Monday he is â€œlooking forwardâ€? to working with Donald Trumpâ€™s upcoming U.S. administration and reiterated the trans-Atlantic allianceâ€™s dedication to increasing funds from non-U.S. members.\nSpeaking at the NATO summit in Istanbul, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said President-elect Trump assured Americaâ€™s â€œstrong supportâ€? for the alliance and the security of Europe during a phone call.\nStoltenberg added that Trump pointed out during Fridayâ€™s call of the â€œimportance of increased defense spending among European allies.â€?\nDuring the election campaign, Trump had called for increasing contributions from allies.\nStoltenberg reminded that all members had pledged to dedicate 2 percent of their GDP to defense spending at the 2014 NATO summit in Wales.\nIn response to a question on alleged Russian interference in NATO countriesâ€™ domestic affairs, Stoltenberg said: â€œWe have seen them conducting propaganda, we are aware of that, we see it. And my answer is that our response to propaganda is not propaganda. But our response to propaganda is facts.â€?\nHe added that Russia was behind cyberattacks in NATO countries and that the alliance was working on strengthening its cyber defenses.\nOn criticism of Turkeyâ€™s sweeping crackdown following the failed coup on July 15, he said Turkey had a right to prosecute all those who were behind it, but added that â€œthis has to be done in accordance with the rule of law.â€?\nTurkey has come under intense criticism from opposition groups and its allies over its crackdown on dissenting voices during the state of emergency declared after the July 15 coup.\nClose to 37,000 people have been arrested, more than 100,000 people dismissed or suspended from government jobs, and 170 media outlets and scores of businesses and associations have been shut down over alleged ties to terrorist organizations.\nStoltenberg said he hoped that closer cooperation between Ankara and the Council of Europe will ensure that â€œthe rule of law is implemented in accordance with the convention (of Human Rights).â€?\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

President Obama spent the last day of his final foreign trip attempting to make headway on one of the most painful aspects of his foreign policy portfolio: the ongoing civil war in Syria.\nJust before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit opened its first formal session Sunday, Obama spoke briefly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was standing by his seat at a massive circular table around which all the participants were arrayed.\nThe four-minute discussion, which a White House official described as â€œbrief and informal,â€? represented the first time the leaders had spoken in person since members of the Group of 20 convened in China in September.\nâ€œI am not optimistic about the short-term prospects in Syria,â€? Obama told reporters Sunday. Once Russia and Iran decided to back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in a brutal air campaign, â€œthen it was very hard to see a way in which even a trained and committed moderate opposition could hold its ground for long periods of time,â€? he said.\nThe president said that his administration would continue to press for a deal to stop the killing in the rebel holdout of Aleppo, but he displayed little optimism.\nPresident Obama says he spoke about the need for a cease fire in Syria when he spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the APEC summit. (Reuters)\nâ€œWeâ€™re just not getting help or interest from those parties that are supporting Assad,â€? he said.\nObamaâ€™s tone was serious and even slightly melancholy when he spoke of the United Statesâ€™ role on the world stage and the advice he would give President-elect Donald Trump. Trump at times has spoken of scaling back U.S. commitments overseas and making allies share a larger portion of the burden of working toward world peace.\nâ€œThe United States really is an indispensable nation in our world order,â€? Obama said. If the United States does not play a central role in fighting pandemics, countering aggression, managing global institutions and speaking up for human rights, Obama warned, the world will become far more dangerous.\nâ€œThen it collapses, and thereâ€™s no one to fill the void,â€? he said of the post-World War II order. â€œThere really isnâ€™t.â€?\nObamaâ€™s remarks came against the backdrop of more bloodshed in Aleppo. On Saturday, Syrian warplanes launched strikes there that killed at least 20 people. Meanwhile, Russia announced the same day that it was launching an offensive in the northern rebel-controlled Idlib province as well as in central Syriaâ€™s Homs province.\nâ€œBeyond pleasantries, the president urged President Putin to uphold Russiaâ€™s commitments under the Minsk agreements, underscoring the U.S. and our partnersâ€™ commitment to Ukraineâ€™s sovereignty,â€? said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic matters. â€œOn Syria, the president noted the need for Secretary [of State John F.] Kerry and Foreign Minister [Sergei] Lavrov to continue pursuing initiatives, together with the broader international community, to diminish the violence and alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people.â€?\n[ In his last foreign trip, Obama tries to shore up U.S. outreach to Asia-Pacific ]\nBut there is little prospect that much will change even though Obama and his top aides have been sharply critical of Russiaâ€™s support for Assad and the atrocities he has carried out in Aleppo, where about 275,000 people still remain. Trump has spoken much more favorably about Putin and Assad, and has said the fall of Aleppo is inevitable.\nâ€œPutin no longer has a reason to negotiate with president Obama and instead will look for better terms on Syria from President Trump,â€? Ilan Goldenberg, who directs the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said in an email. â€œFor the next two months, the Russians will ignore American and international entreaties and work with Assad and the Iranians to do all they can to pulverize Aleppo and destroy the Syrian opposition.â€?\nOn Saturday, national security adviser Susan E. Rice condemned the fact that all remaining hospitals in eastern Aleppo, as well as several staging locations for first responders, have been destroyed in attacks by forces loyal to Assad.\nâ€œThere is no excuse for these heinous actions,â€? Rice said in a statement. â€œFor years, the United States has worked with our international partners to support their relief efforts and provide humanitarian aid to the Syrian people suffering as a direct result Assadâ€™s war against his own people, which Moscow has aided and abetted. The Syrian regime and its allies, Russia in particular, bears responsibly for the immediate and long term consequences these actions have caused in Syria and beyond.â€?\nGoldenberg said that although Putin is likely to lobby Trump to accept the idea that Assad should stay in power, the problem remains that the alliance of Russia, Syria and Iran â€œdoes not have the ground power to retake and hold all of the necessary territory in Northwest Syria. Instead they will destroy what is left of the acceptable opposition and drive it into the hands of extremists.â€?\nIn addition to his informal talks with Putin, Obama met one-on-one with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nAfter speaking with Turnbull, Obama said he had conveyed his confidence that there would be â€œa strong handoff and continuity in the next administration.â€?\nTurnbull emphasized the views that he and Obama share, noting that â€œon trade we are quite of the same mind, on the importance of open markets.â€? He added, looking at Obama, â€œWe want America to succeed under the next president, just as it has succeeded under your leadership.â€? Obamaâ€™s term ends in January, and Trump had promised on the campaign trail that he would rip up U.S. trade deals.\npolitics\nNews and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11.\npost_newsletter353\n	washingtonpost	World

Syriaâ€™s army said Tuesday that it had formed a new volunteer corps to join its five-year war effort, an announcement that underscored the extent to which its once-sprawling armed forces have crumbled.?\nIn a statement, the army encouraged men 18 and older to register for the newly minted Fifth Legion at recruitment centers across the country.?\nIt said the volunteers would work alongside forces allied with the Syrian government, â€œeliminating terrorismâ€? and returning â€œsecurity and stabilityâ€? to the country.\nAs Syriaâ€™s war grinds on, President Bashar al-Assadâ€™s army is increasingly reliant on conscripts and even prisoners. It also receives heavy support from Russian and Iranian forces and Iran-backed Shiite militias, as well as powerful Syrian paramilitary groups.?\nIn a rare speech last year, Assad described the problem as a â€œshortfall in human capacityâ€? but insisted that his military remained ready and able to fight.\nâ€œDefeat does not exist in the dictionary of the Syrian Arab Army,â€? he said.?\n[ In Aleppo, Shiite militias highlight Iranâ€™s influence ]\nAlthough the numerical strength of Syriaâ€™s remaining military force is unknown, experts say it is less than half of its 300,000-strong prewar high. That sharp reduction has hurt its ability to hold land without the help of its allies.\nâ€œWe know the Syrian Arab Army is facing a serious manpower shortage due to defections, desertions, draft evasion and casualties,â€? said Faysal Itani, a resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Councilâ€™s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East, a Washington-based think tank.\nSyria already conscripts men 18 and older into the army. Before the war, that service would last for two years. Now, many conscripts say they have served much longer, with no sign of discharge on the horizon.\nMen of fighting age are routinely picked up from checkpoints if their names are on a list of wanted conscripts. But others are unable to avoid the draft.\nMen fleeing military service are dotted throughout the Syrian diaspora. Many have been able to?defer military service with a payment of $300, but not all have been as lucky.?\nGeorge, 35, a laborer from the western province of Homs, said he was arrested as he tried to leave Syria.?\nIn an interview in Turkey earlier this year, he described how he had been flown first to the northeastern city of Qamishli and later to the eastern province of Deir al-Zour. There, he manned a checkpoint facing an Islamic State position. â€œIt was terror every day,â€? he said. â€œThey knew I was a Christian, and I feared for my life.â€?\n[ 10 new wars that could be unleashed as a result of the one against ISIS ]\nFighters have even been recruited from the prison population. Three inmates freed from the Adra Central Prison near Damascus told The Washington Post that prison officials had offered cellmates their freedom in return for a commitment to fight. More than 100 men had accepted, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\nWith the Syrian economy in free fall, the Damascus war effort has been bolstered by two powerful militia forces ? known as the Tiger Forces and the Desert Hawks ? that pay higher salaries and allow recruits more freedom to reap the spoils of war, taking bribes at checkpoints and looting areas newly retaken from the armed opposition.\nIn an apparent attempt to circumvent that, the militaryâ€™s statement Tuesday said state employees would retain the right to benefits they were already receiving through their jobs.\nItani said the provision appeared aimed at â€œsweetening the deal,â€? adding that the announcement may also be a concession to one of the governmentâ€™s key military allies, Russia.\nâ€œRussia has preferred to deal with state institutions over militia, but that hasnâ€™t always been practical due to the composition of forces fighting the insurgency,â€? he said.\nRussian and Iranian forces are playing a central?role in the battle to retake the eastern districts of Aleppo from rebel forces.

Russian airstrikes have mostly targeted opposition groups that are supported by the United States?as well as civilians in opposition held areas.\nBut whatâ€™s most unnerving is not Gabbardâ€™s misunderstanding of the realities of the war in Syria. If she had said that while holding the post of U.N. ambassador, her defense of Russian actions and support for the Bashar al-Assad regime would make America complicit in some of the most horrendous war crimes of the modern era.\nIn her statement after meeting with Trump, Gabbard said she set her partisan affiliation aside for the chance to talk with the president-elect about the need to get out of the regime change business in Syria.\nâ€œI felt it important to take the opportunity to meet with the President-elect now before the drumbeats of war that neocons have been beating drag us into an escalation of the war to overthrow the Syrian government,â€? she said .\nGabbard told Trump about her legislation to end the semi-covert CIA program to arm and train Syrian rebels fighting the Assad regime and the overt Defense Department?program to arm and train Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State. An Iraq War veteran , she often speaks out against what she calls â€œinterventionist, regime change warfare.â€? She is opposed to any effort to establish no-fly zones or safe zones in Syria.\nGabbardâ€™s aversion to U.S. military intervention is not limited to Syria. She was publicly against the United States?attacking the Islamic State in Iraq in June 2014, just after the terrorist group took over Mosul, Iraqâ€™s second largest city. â€œI do not advocate for getting involved in either Iraq or Syria,â€? she said on CNN, calling the Iraqi governmentâ€™s battle against the Islamic State a â€œcivil war.â€?\nTrump shares many of Gabbardâ€™s instincts on foreign policy, including skepticism of U.S. military intervention in Syria and distrust of the rebels, who both see as worse than the Assad regime. Both have criticized the neoconservative current in foreign policy and expressed support for working with Russia in the Middle East.\nBut Trump has never gone so far as to work to prevent the international community from holding the Assad regime and its partners accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Gabbard proudly has.\nIn March, Gabbard was one of only three lawmakers?? and the only Democrat??? to vote against a non-binding resolution calling out the Assad regime for war crimes and stating that the United States?should support the establishment of an international tribunal to bring war criminals to justice. She tweeted that the resolution was a thinly veiled call for regime change in Syria and compared it to congressional action before the Iraq and Libya wars.\nGabbard specifically objected to language in the bill that called for additional protections for civilians inside Syria and actions to ensure access to humanitarian aid in targeted areas. In a news release, she called that â€œa thinly veiled attempt to use the rationale of â€˜humanitarianismâ€™ as a justification for overthrowing the Syrian government of Assad.â€?\nOn foreign policy, Trump and Gabbard represent a reaction to more than a decade of U.S. military interventions abroad that have been poorly planned, poorly executed and poorly explained to the American people. The foreign policy community must acknowledge the publicâ€™s war weariness while redoubling efforts to educate regular Americans about what the United States can and must do on the world stage to protect national interests and?defend U.S. values abroad.\nThere are many Trump administration officials who understand this nuance: Vice President-elect Mike Pence, incoming national security advisor Michael Flynn and incoming CIA Director Mike Pompeo have all supported confronting Assad and Russiaâ€™s war crimes in Syria one way or the other. It will fall to them to explain to the country, and perhaps Trump himself, that thereâ€™s a middle ground between occupying a country, as happened in Iraq, and standing by while thousands of innocent people are slaughtered by their own government.\nDespite her willingness to bash Democrats on Fox News and call for the use of the term â€œradical Islamic terrorism,â€? Gabbard wonâ€™t fit in that team. Itâ€™s also doubtful that the Senate would easily confirm her, considering there are bipartisan calls to stand up to Russian aggression and hold Assad accountable for his role in mass atrocities.\nFrederic C. Hof, a former State Department official who worked on Syria, explained Monday why defending actions that amount to war crimes in Syria is so damaging.\nâ€œThe slaughter of Syrian civilians and its policy consequences are bad enough,â€? he wrote . â€œThe narratives of those who unashamedly glorify the perpetrators and those who coldly dismiss defending the defenseless add enduring insult to an ongoing abomination.â€?\nGabbardâ€™s plan to overtly side with Assad and Russia while they commit war crimes and crimes against humanity would reverse decades of U.S. commitment to standing up to mass atrocities. For the sake of Americaâ€™s role and reputation in the world, letâ€™s hope Trump considers that before choosing her to represent the United States?on the world stage.\nopinions\n	washingtonpost	World

Itâ€™s deeply alarming.\nThe inside track on Washington politics.\nBe the first to know about new stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and weâ€™ll e-mail you free updates as theyâ€™re published.\nYouâ€™ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published.\nYouâ€™re all set!\nBy Greg Sargent November 23 at 8:59 AM Follow @theplumlinegs\n(Reuters/Carlo Allegri)\nTHE MORNING PLUM:\nThis morning, the New York Times published a full transcript of the remarkable set of exchanges that occurred yesterday between Donald Trump and the paperâ€™s editors and reporters . Some, such as Tom Friedman, see cause for hope in the fact that Trump appears to be moderating his stances on climate change and torture, as well as in the indications that Trump perhaps allows the advice of others to shape his thinking ? sort of, at least.\nThere is a bit of cause for hope in the transcript ? more on that later. But on balance, the main takeaway from it should be that, if anything, we should be more alarmed, rather than less.\nThough itâ€™s true that Trump did shift on climate, the exchange on this topic is, on balance, more worrying than not, and it perhaps deserves the most attention, because as Iâ€™ve argued , the question of whether Trump will really pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord is one of the most consequential we face. Hereâ€™s the exchange on that topic:\nQUESTION: Are you going to take America out of the worldâ€™s lead of confronting climate change?\nTRUMP: Iâ€™m looking at it very closelyâ€¦.Iâ€™ll tell you what. I have an open mind to it. Weâ€™re going to look very carefully. Itâ€™s one issue thatâ€™s interesting because there are few things where thereâ€™s more division than climate change. . . .\nItâ€™s a very complex subject. Iâ€™m not sure anybody is ever going to really know. I know we have, they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists. . . .\nQUESTION:?When you say an open mind, you mean youâ€™re just not sure whether human activity causes climate change? Do you think human activity is or isnâ€™t connected?\nTRUMP: I think right now â€¦ well, I think there is some connectivity. There is some, something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much itâ€™s going to cost our companies.\nItâ€™s good that Trump acknowledged that human activity might be connected to climate change. But the mere fact that this is seen as a major breakthrough is alone a reminder of how worrying it is that the incoming president is someone who previously said climate change is nothing but a â€œhoax.â€? What probably happened here is that Trump knew he could not tell this particular audience that climate change has no human cause without feeling or looking foolish. This may have been a driving motivator in making this concession, which, when you really examine it, is a pretty tiny one. Indeed, Trump also flatly says here that we may not ever know who is right in the dispute over whether climate change poses the dire long-term threat that the scientific consensus tells us it does.\n[ Journalists shouldnâ€™t try to win a popularity contest with Trump ]\nWhatâ€™s more, Trump does not appear at all preoccupied with another crucial aspect of this line of questioning: the notion that pulling out of the Paris accord would mean the U.S. is abdicating its global leadership role in combating global warming. Nor does he seem preoccupied with the potential? consequences of this, i.e., that it heralds a badly weakened global consensus behind the need to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius before it is too late, which in turn could make future widespread human suffering and dislocation far more likely. The main consequences here Trump appears even aware of are the supposed â€œcost to our companiesâ€? of acting to curb carbon emissions.\nFrance tells U.S. President-elect Donald Trump that the Paris accord on climate change is "irreversible" and that the U.S. will be affected by rising oceans and natural disasters. (Reuters)\nItâ€™s also less than reassuring that Trump cites the â€œhorrible emails that were sent between the scientists.â€? That appears to be a reference to a seven-year-old â€œscandalâ€? in which a large number of hacked emails between climate scientists supposedly revealed that the science is largely fabricated. Those emails actually showed nothing of the sort . But regardless, the idea that this, of all things, is still weighing (if thatâ€™s the right way to put it) on Trumpâ€™s mind ? when the scientific consensus has been reaffirmed again and again countless times over the many years since then ? is?disconcerting, to say the least.\nAll that said, Friedman makes a good point when he argues that the interview shows that Trump â€œclearly learns by talking to people, not reading,â€? and that â€œthe struggle for Donald Trumpâ€™s soul has just begun.â€? Elsewhere in the Times interview , Trump gushed about his recent private meeting with President Obama, and seemed to signal that he genuinely learned new and enlightening things about the complexities and challenges heâ€™s about to face. I suspect that in private conversations, Trump is susceptible to persuasion by those who really appear to know what theyâ€™re talking about, since his own convictions donâ€™t appear to be all that deeply rooted.\n[ Trump may have just flatly and openly admitted to a conflict of interest ]\nOn climate, for instance, one can imagine a scenario in which the relatively non-crazy Mitt Romney becomes secretary of state and advises Trump that pulling out of the Paris deal might create all sorts of international diplomatic complications that should give him pause about acting too rashly. John Kerry is already suggesting something like this might happen . To avoid doing too much damage, Trump would also have to refrain from reversing Obamaâ€™s climate rules putting us on track to lower carbon emissions. Trump could conceivably be influenced by the fact that hundreds of companies are now warning that a weakened commitment to a lower-carbon future could pose a grave threat to our long term prosperity.?We donâ€™t yet know whose counsel Trump will truly value, but we can hope.\nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says action on climate change has become "unstoppable" and predicts that President-elect Donald Trump will drop plans to quit the global climate change deal. (Reuters)\n*********************************************************************\n* OBAMA OVERTIME RULE CHANGE BLOCKED: A federal court has blocked Obamaâ€™s executive action raising overtime pay for four million workers under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which had been challenged by some states and business groups. Note this from the AP write-up :\nOvertime changes set to take effect Dec. 1 are now unlikely to be in play before vast power shifts to a Donald Trump administration, which has spoken out against Obama-backed government regulation and generally aligns with the business groups that stridently opposed the overtime rule.\nTrump, who ran on a supposedly pro-worker agenda, will probably support the ruling. Elections have consequences!\n* BATTLE ERUPTS FOR DNC CHAIR: Dem Rep. Keith Ellison, a Muslim, is running for DNC chair, but the New York Times reports that the White House and other Dems are pushing Labor Secretary Tom Perez :\nSome Democrats, in Mr. Obamaâ€™s orbit and beyond, say that elevating Mr. Ellison would amount to handing the party to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. . . . Mr. Ellison was a high-profile backer of Mr. Sandersâ€™s presidential campaign, and Mr. Sanders has been rallying support for Mr. Ellisonâ€™s D.N.C. bid.\nThe deeper dispute is over whether Dems lost because they strayed from populism and nominated a creature of the establishment. Perez has deep ties to unions, but heâ€™s less of an outsider than Sanders is.\n* TRUMPâ€™S COMMENTS ON CLINTON STIR CONCERNS: Trump now says his administration wonâ€™t prosecute Hillary Clinton. But The Post reports that experts worry Trump doesnâ€™t get that this isnâ€™t his decision and that the Justice Department is independent . One says:\nâ€œTrumpâ€™s implicit assumption that he can direct the Department of Justice to prosecute Clinton ? or not ? demonstrates a dangerous assumption the president can dictate the departmentâ€™s prosecutorial decisions. But the Department of Justice depends on its independence as the source of its authority and power.â€?\nIn other words, the underlying assumption seems to be that Trump also thinks he can dictate affirmative decisions to prosecute. How reassuring . . .\n* CONSERVATIVES WORRY ABOUT TRUMP GOING WOBBLY: Politico talks to conservatives who are increasingly worried by Trumpâ€™s modifications of his positions . They want reassurances that heâ€™ll fully repeal Obamacare (rather than just change it, as heâ€™s hinted he might) and?honor his promises on immigration.\nMy question is: What would that look like? Does Trump have to build a border wall, remove protections from deportation from the dreamers, and deport as many longtime U.S. residents as possible to make them happy?\n* HALEY TAPPED AS U.N. AMBASSADOR: Trump has tapped South Carolina governor Nikki Haley as U.N. Ambassador :\nHer views on various U.S. military and national security matters usually fall within the GOPâ€™s hawkish mainstream. . . . Haley also represents the addition of a rival. She was critical of some of Trumpâ€™s proposals, such as his temporary ban on Muslimsâ€™ entry to the U.S., during the Republican
 primary contest.\nThe addition of someone who (apparently) doesnâ€™t think weâ€™re embroiled in a global war with Islam is relatively good news.\n* CLINTONâ€™S POPULAR VOTE WIN PASSES TWO MILLION: Thatâ€™s per the latest calculations by Cook Political Reportâ€™s Dave Wasserman , who now puts her margin at 1.5 percentage points.\n* TRUMP SAYS HE CANâ€™T HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Trump also said in the Times interview that â€œthe lawâ€™s totally on my side, the president canâ€™t have a conflict of interest.â€? Glenn Kessler and Michelle Lee investigate the claim and get to the key nuance :\nThe president-elect?did rightly point to an exemption for the president and vice president in conflicts of interest laws.?And while such an exemption exists, the theory was that the presidency has so much power that any policy decision?could pose a potential conflict. The law assumed that the president could be trusted to do the right thing and take actions to avoid appearance or presence of impropriety ? not that the law is â€œtotallyâ€? on the presidentâ€™s â€œsideâ€? or that it would allow the president to use the exemption to his favor.\nTrump obviously canâ€™t be trusted to take actions to avoid the appearance of impropriety, but surely he can be trusted to do the right thing.\n?\n	washingtonpost	World

You are.	2016-11-23 00:00:00	By Drew Harwell and Lisa Rein November 23 at 11:27 AM Follow @drewharwell Follow @Reinlwapo\nPresident-elect Donald Trump waves as he arrives on Nov. 20 at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse in New Jersey. (Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press)\nPresident-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s jet-setting transition effort? Your tax dollars, hard at work.\nLike incoming presidents before him, Trump and his team will reap a big public payoff to aid with their move into the White House, including $7 million in Congress-appropriated funds for transition and appointee costs.\nBut for Trump, the rise to power offers an added bonus. Choosing his own luxury accommodations as a transition base, he has helped direct the countryâ€™s attention to properties the Trump companies are eager to advertise, including Trump Tower in Manhattan and the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey.\nMany transition teams have started from scratch, opting for government-offered offices and telephones in downtown Washington. But Trump has used his own high-profile real estate, helping embolden an effort already aided by a private transition fund and the most public transition money ever offered to a president-elect.\nNo law prevents the president-elect from using that public money to reimburse his own businesses. But Trump spokesman Jason Miller told The Washington Post that â€œno Congress-appropriated transition funding will be going to any Trump businesses.â€?\nThe president-elect has faced increasing scrutiny in recent days over whether his private companies could profit off his public influence. Trump has refused to separate himself from his business interests, stoking worries over the conflicts of interest that could arise from his decisions in the Oval Office.\nTrump has said that his children will run his businesses during his presidency, but ethics advisers say that offers little guarantee that Trump wonâ€™t make presidential decisions that could boost his business interests. He named his children to his transition teamâ€™s executive committee, giving them influential roles in whom he selects for key political appointments.\nTrumpâ€™s transition spending and potential conflicts have already become big targets for Democrats. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter Wednesday to the Government Accountability Office requesting a review of Trumpâ€™s public spending in the weeks before the inauguration.\nâ€œThere is no transparency with regard to transition expenditures, raising additional questions about how taxpayer funds may be flowing into Mr. Trumpâ€™s pockets,â€? Warren wrote. â€œâ€¦ To what extent have Mr. Trumpâ€™s conflicts of interest affected his presidential transition?â€?\nCongress appropriated $6 million for the president-elect and his transition team in the fiscal 2017 budget, which began Oct. 1 of this year, according to the General Services Administration, the federal agency that manages government space and services.\nAnother $1 million is set aside to help prepare new appointees, while $2.5 million is allocated to help the Obama administration on the way out, the GSA said.\nA spokesman for the GSA said the Trump team has not sought reimbursement for use of space in a Trump property or golf course. The final call for transition payments is still months away.\nThe law covering transition spending, the Presidential Transitions Effectiveness Act of 1988, says nothing about self-dealing and has never been tested by a president-elect whose business holdings could directly benefit.\nThat public money will be supplemented by private donations given to Trump for America Inc., a 501(c)(4) tax-exempt nonprofit separate from the campaign and launched earlier this year. In exchange for the governmentâ€™s support, the transition teams must agree to $5,000 limits for each private individual and corporate donor.\nTrumpâ€™s private transition fund has already proven a valuable target for donors seeking to double down on the support they gave Trump before the election ? or make amends for not backing the president-electâ€™s campaign.\nFundraising for that effort has been in full swing for weeks. A few days before the election, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Heritage Foundation president Ed Feulner hosted a $5,000-per-person fundraiser and transition â€œinformation sessionâ€? at the Washington office of BakerHostetler, a law firm that has pocketed nearly $2 million in lobbying income this year.\nWhoâ€™s donating to Trumpâ€™s transition? We probably wonâ€™t know until Trump has assumed power. The first disclosure filing, required in exchange for the GSAâ€™s services, is not due until 30 days after the Jan. 20 inauguration.\nThe Trump Foundation, a regular channel for donations to Trump, could also delay reporting its 2016 tax returns until November 2017, meaning voters wonâ€™t know who gave Trump money during his transition stage until nearly the end of his first year in office.\nThe 73 days between election and inauguration are a period of costly chaos: The president-elect must make 4,100 political appointments, 1,100 of which need Senate confirmation.?Trump has held more than 60 meetings since the election to plan and staff his administration, Miller said Wednesday.\nThe transition also comes with a strict deadline. On Jan. 20, Trump will instantly gain power over a massive force, including a $4 trillion federal operation and with 4 million federal workers and armed-forces personnel.\nThe public funding will cover the costs of a transition operation at GSA headquarters in downtown Washington, where the transition staff is vetting candidates for thousands of the positions it needs to fill across the government with political appointees.\nPast presidential transitions have generally relied on that government-provided office space and other â€œin-kindâ€? help. But there are exceptions: In 2008, President-elect Barack Obamaâ€™s team worked out of a Chicago transition office chosen by GSA officials.\nTrumpâ€™s transition team will have more public money at their disposal than past transition efforts. Obamaâ€™s team spent $5.2 million in appropriated public dollars and $4 million in private donations, data show. George W. Bushâ€™s 2000 transition spent $5 million in private money and $4 million in public funds.\nBut the price tag of Trumpâ€™s transition effort for now remains a mystery: Much of it has taken place almost solely in the golden confines of Trump Tower and his bucolic New Jersey golf club. That could lead the transition effort to rely heavily on private donors.\nâ€œThe money they get is not typically enough to pay for all transition activities, so theyâ€™re forced to raise money privately. They go to maxed-out donors,â€? said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan good-government group. â€œEven if they spend it on very expensive Trump Tower space, theyâ€™re going to actually have to raise that money.â€?\nTrumpâ€™s presidential run was a robust moneymaker for Trumpâ€™s businesses. More than $9.6 million in campaign donations was used to cover expenses for Trumpâ€™s companies and family, including payments for his private-jet company Tag Air, rent and payroll at Trump Tower and rental space at the new Trump International Hotel in Washington, election filings show.\nTrump gave his campaign more than $66 million in cash and in-kind contributions, short of his repeated pledge that he would spend $100 million of cash on his White House bid, filings show. But Trumpâ€™s campaign prospered in other ways. When U.S. Secret Service agents guarding Trump traveled on Trumpâ€™s jets, the federal government, in keeping with policy, reimbursed Trumpâ€™s company.\nTrump regularly criticized President Obama for his use of public funds. In July, Trump tweeted that it was a â€œtotal disgraceâ€? and that taxpayers were â€œpaying a fortuneâ€? after Obama flew via Air Force One to a campaign event for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\npowerpost\n	washingtonpost	World

(Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images)\nThese two things regarding?President-elect Donald Trump and the news media have happened?over the past 24 hours:\n1. Trump huddled with top executives and on-air talent from the major TV networks, scolding them for their alleged lack of fairness in covering him during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n2. ?Trump canceled a planned meeting today with the executives and editors at the New York Times -- via Twitter , natch.\nI cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice\n? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016\nThis is, of course, a continuation of how Trump interacted with the media during the campaign -- using?it?as a punching bag, socked when necessary to accomplish some goal only Trump?can see. ( Trump reversed course on the New York Times meeting by later Tuesday morning ; it is happening as this post is being published.)\nThere was hope in some media circles that Trump might change his approach to journalists in the wake of his victory, that as the soon-to-be president he would understand that calling major news organizations "failing" or "biased" or "broken" or attacking individual journalists for what he calls their unfair coverage was neither the right nor productive thing to do. Or that he would acquiesce to having a protective media pool with him at all times -- in keeping with a long-standing tradition of how U.S. presidents are covered.\nNope!\nTrump's unchanging attitude toward the media reveals a deeper misunderstanding -- whether purposeful or not -- of?what the responsibility of journalists is and should be when it comes to covering the White House.\nIn light of President-elect Trump's meetings with media executives on Nov. 21 and the New York Times on Nov. 22, Washington Post media columnists Erik Wemple and Margaret Sullivan talk about the merit of off-the-record meetings and the role of the media in Trump's administration with Facebook Live host Libby Casey. (The Washington Post)\nFor Trump, "good" reporters or "good" media outlets are those that report stories that are good for him and/or nice to him. ?The opposite is also true: You are a "bad" reporter or a "bad" media company if you report on news that paints Trump in a less-than-favorable light -- facts be damned.\nSo, The Washington Post's David Fahrenthold , who continues to do Pulitzer Prize-worthy work on the major problems with Trump's charitable foundation , is a bad reporter who has a vendetta against Trump -- ?a totally unsubstantiated (and wrong) allegation. Or, in my case, I am "one of the dumber and least-respected of the political pundits" ( Trump said that about me last spring ), except when I write something -- like this piece on how it was clear Republican voters wanted him as their nominee -- that he likes. In those cases I am smart and good.\nIt's all of a piece?with Trump's broader worldview: You are either for him or against him. There is absolutely no in between. (There is, however, an ability to move between terrible and good, based on the last article you published and whether or not Trump liked it/perceived it as "good" for him.)\nThe idea of the media as the intermediary between Trump and the public -- reporting on and analyzing his proposals, contextualizing his statements, fact-checking him (and the Democratic politicians opposing him) -- is totally lost on him. ?The media is to be judged solely on whether or not they, collectively, are being nice to the president.\nBeing "nice" to a president or simply writing down what he says is not the news media's job. Most politicians know this -- even if they would prefer that journalists be less adversarial and more willing to just sort of take their word for it. Trump is outside of that normal understanding of how presidents and the people tasked with reporting on?them need to interact and understand one another.\nIn a must-read New Yorker piece ?on Trump and the media, editor David Remnick quotes a source in the room during Trump's Monday meeting with the TV executives and anchors. â€œHe truly doesnâ€™t seem to understand the First Amendment,â€? the source told Remnick of Trump. â€œHe doesnâ€™t. He thinks we are supposed to say what he says and thatâ€™s it.â€?\nTrump's view of the media won't cause him a second of worry among many of the voters who put him in the White House. The media, they believe, is fundamentally corrupt and biased and deserves every bit of the treatment Trump is dishing out. Which is fine, I guess.\nBut, ask yourself -- whether you voted for Trump, Hillary Clinton or someone else -- whether it's a good thing for the most powerful person in the country not just to fundamentally misunderstand the news media's role in public accountability but also to work to discredit that media? ?Your answer should be that it is a very bad thing.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	World

(Photo by Hiroko Masuike/New York Times via AP)\nHours after he canceled a meeting with the New York Times and tweeted that the â€œfailingâ€? newspaper's coverage is too â€œnasty,â€? President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday attended the session after all and said, â€œI'd like to turn it around.â€?\nOn Wednesday, the Times' editorial board wrote that â€œit was good to hear him even call the New York Times a 'great, great American jewel.' "\nSounds like the beginning of a new era of civility.?It probably isn't.\nThe full message of the Times' editorial is that the newspaper is open-minded but still highly skeptical of Trump. And Trump does not appreciate skepticism.\nIn light of President-elect Trump's meetings with media executives on Nov. 21 and the New York Times on Nov. 22, Washington Post media columnists Erik Wemple and Margaret Sullivan talk about the merit of off-the-record meetings and the role of the media in Trump's administration with Facebook Live host Libby Casey.

The media is to be judged solely on whether or not they, collectively, are being nice to the president.â€?\nSo Trump will like this part of the Times' editorial: â€œHey, if President-elect Trump moderates his views, and then crystallizes those views in policies that, as he put it, 'save our country,' we will commend him on growth in office.â€?\nHe might also like this part: â€œWe would applaud any sensible change of position, however arrived at.â€?\nBut he will hate the final paragraph: â€œRonald Reagan used to say that in dealing with the Soviet Union, the right approach was to 'trust, but verify.' For now, that's also the right approach to take with Mr. Trump. Except, regrettably, for the trust part.â€?\nIn other words, the Times?? like other news outlets?? is not going to take Trump's statements at face value when he is in office. The paper will demand evidence, challenge claims and scrutinize proposals. Trump won't like it. We know this because in the past that sort of coverage has resulted in?tweets like these:\nWow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"\n?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016\nWhen Trump said he wants to â€œturn it around,â€? he meant that he wants the Times to ease up. He did not mean that he wants to develop a fuller appreciation of the role of a free press in a democratic society. He is, after all, an incoming president who made weakening libel protections for journalists part of his campaign platform.\nPleasantries aside, there is little evidence that Trump's view of the media will change, nor is there any reason to think New York Times coverage will change.

U.S. scores are likely to stoke renewed debate among politicians, educators and business leaders about why math and science achievement has not improved more quickly relative to other nations.\nU.S. fourth-graders, for example, scored an average of 539 out of 1,000 possible points in math, down two points from the average in 2011.\nScores have risen at both grade levels and in both math and science since TIMSS was first given in 1995. Matt Larson, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, said the long-term trend is heartening ? and means far more than the change over a four-year span.\nâ€œCertainly we have much more work to do and achievement is not as high as we would like to have it,â€? Larson said. â€œBut the trajectory is positive, and it may indicate that some of the efforts weâ€™ve made over the past two and a half decades are making a difference.â€?\nThe average score of U.S. eighth-graders rose from 509 in 2011 to 518 in 2015, painting a picture of improvement that contradicts results on another important assessment: the National Assessment of Educational Progress, often called the Nationâ€™s Report Card. On that test, eighth-graders showed a decline in achievement from 2011 to 2015.\nPeggy Carr, acting commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, said she did not know why the results of the two tests show such different patterns. But she said that the national exam tends toward questions that are more â€œcomplexâ€? than the questions on TIMSS.\n[ U.S. students slip on national test ]\nOn TIMSS, the average score of U.S. fourth-graders in math put them behind students in 10 other systems: Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Russia, Northern Ireland and Ireland, Norway, and the Flemish portion of Belgium.\nIn Singapore, for example, 50 percent of students scored high enough to be considered advanced in math, compared with just 14 percent of U.S. students who reached that benchmark.\nU.S. fourth-gradersâ€™ average score was indistinguishable from nine other systems and higher than 34 systems.\nU.S. students ranked comparably in science.\nDavid Evans, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association, said the slow progress is cause for some concern but is not surprising given that Americans so often treat science and math as inscrutable fields of study that arenâ€™t essential to becoming educated in the same way that reading and writing are.\nDuring the two decades in which TIMSS has been administered, he said, the time devoted to science has decreased as schools under pressure to raise standardized test scores have focused their attention on math and reading. But there has been no big change in the way science has been taught in the United States.\nEvans said that he is now hopeful that new science standards that have been adopted by a growing number of states ? and that push students to solve problems and learn about science by doing science ? will make a difference, prompting bigger gains in the coming years.\nâ€œI think weâ€™re right now at the very beginning of what could be a very significant change in the way we teach science,â€? Evans said.\nAlso released Tuesday were the results of TIMSS Advanced, a study of the performance of high school seniors who take advanced courses in physics and math. Those studentsâ€™ achievement is unchanged since 1995, the only other year in which the United States participated in that exam.\nAmong fourth- and eighth-grade students, the gender gap has narrowed or closed in math and science, according to TIMSS results. But there continues to be a yawning gender gap among the advanced high school seniors: Males scored 46 points higher than females in physics, and 30 points higher in math.\nlocal\n	washingtonpost	World

One of Africaâ€™s longest-ruling leaders, Gambiaâ€™s mercurial and iron-fisted President Yahya Jammeh, was voted out in a stunning election loss more than 20?years after seizing power in a military coup, ballot results showed Friday.\nThe outcome ? and indications that Jammeh would accept the votersâ€™ will ? stood in sharp contrast to the numerous African nations where strongman rulers have recently imposed changes that effectively guarantee their hold on power, sidelining the opposition.\nJammeh was defeated by Adama Barrow, an estate agent and former security guard with little political experience. Few imagined that he would topple Jammeh, who has controlled the tiny West African country of 2?million since 1994 and who once vowed to rule for â€œ1?billion years, if God wills.â€? Despite its small size, more people have fled to Europe from Gambia than from almost any other country in Africa, leaving behind poverty and a repressive political climate.\nUntil the last minute, when Gambiaâ€™s election commission announced the results, many Gambians assumed Jammeh would find a way to declare himself the victor.\nInternet and phone lines were cut in parts of the country, adding to speculation that Jammehâ€™s regime was laying the groundwork to stay in power. Jammeh had jailed his political opposition for years, and it seemed likely that he would take measures to maintain his grip.\nSupporters of President-elect Adama Barrow celebrate his election victory in Banjul, Gambia, Dec. 2, 2016. REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY (Thierry Gouegnon/Reuters)\nBut as the vote tally became clear, the election commission chief, Alieu Momar Njie, announced that Jammeh would concede.\nâ€œItâ€™s unique that someone who has been ruling this country for so long has accepted defeat,â€? Njie told reporters in Banjul, the capital.\nJammeh has been one of the worldâ€™s most unpredictable, and often incoherent, leaders.\nHe declared that he had found a cure for AIDS consisting of local herbs. He gave himself the quixotic title of â€œConqueror of Rivers.â€? His face was plastered on billboards across the country. People spoke about him in whispers, worried that one of the governmentâ€™s plainclothes spies might be listening.\nThis year, he withdrew from the International Criminal Court, which his minister of information called the â€œInternational Caucasian Court,â€? implying that it was a Western institution biased against Africans.\nThough he was widely mocked for his far-fetched pronouncements, there was a vicious dark side to his rule.\nHe threatened to personally slit the throats of gay men. His failed efforts to boost the countryâ€™s agricultural productivity left millions of Gambians in poverty, with few prospects other than to migrate to Europe, which a disproportionate number of them have done . By October, more than 10,000 Gambians had arrived in Italy in 2016 alone, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, making Gambia the fifth-largest source of refugees in all of Africa, even though it has one of the smallest populations.\nJammeh shrugged off the huge exodus , saying that â€œtrue Muslimsâ€? would persuade their children to stay in the country.\nBut it appears that the same desperation that prompted thousands of Gambians to flee has now led to Jammehâ€™s electoral upset.\nâ€œGambians were tired of dictatorship, tired of being poor, tired of being a pariah in the region,â€? said Jeffrey Smith, founding director of Vanguard Africa, a nonprofit organization that has worked closely with the opposition. â€œItâ€™s certainly a shot across the bow for entrenched, abusive governments across Africa.â€?\nIn recent years, the leaders of Rwanda, Burundi, Congo and Sudan have changed their constitutions or cracked down on their opponents to extend their rule.\nBarrow, leader of his countryâ€™s United Democratic Party, had spent several years in Britain as a department store security guard. He returned to his native country and rose through the ranks of the fledgling political opposition, whose leaders were frequently jailed by Jammehâ€™s government.\nIn July, opposition leader Ousainou Darboe and 18 others were sentenced to three years in prison for taking part in an unauthorized demonstration. In April, another opposition leader, Solo Sandeng, was allegedly beaten to death by members of the Gambian security services, according to witnesses, after being arrested for leading a demonstration in favor of electoral reform. The government later acknowledged Sandengâ€™s death in an affidavit, saying it was caused by â€œshockâ€? and â€œrespiratory failure.â€?\nâ€œAlhamdulillah,â€? or â€œPraise be to Godâ€? in Arabic, Sandengâ€™s daughter wrote on Facebook after the election results were announced.\nUnlike in previous Gambian elections, all of the countyâ€™s splinter opposition groups united behind Barrow, giving him the groundswell of support he needed to defeat Jammeh.\nThat support was evident Thursday as voters dropped marbles in different-colored buckets, each associated with a different candidate. On Friday, the marbles were counted.\nBarrow had 263,515 votes. Jammeh had 212,099. Jammeh had not yet publicly conceded, but the electoral commission said he soon would.\nIt took only minutes for people to begin dancing in the streets.\nRead more\n	washingtonpost	World

Russia has been in contact over Syria with the team of President-elect Donald Trump, a senior Russian diplomat said Wednesday, suggesting that Moscow is already looking past the Obama administration when it comes to the crisis in Syria.\nDeputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov?was quoted by the state-run Tass news agency as saying that Russia had been in communication with?â€œseveral people that we have known for a long time.â€?\nBogdanov, President Vladi?mir Putinâ€™s special representative?for the Middle East and Africa, declined to name the Trump team members, adding only that Moscow hoped that relations with Washington over Syria would improve under the incoming administration.?\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unable â€œto confirm information about contactsâ€? between Russia and Trumpâ€™s team. â€œAs far as we know, the new team of the president-elect has yet to be formed,â€? Peskov said. He added that negotiations about Syria and other conflict areas â€œare continuing with our partners of the current administration of the U.S. president.â€?\nBogdanovâ€™s announcement followed the revelation that Donald Trump Jr., the oldest son of the president-elect, had private talks before the election with diplomats and politicians in Paris on collaborating with Russia to end the conflict in Syria.?\nTrump Jr. was one of about 30 people who assembled in a private room at the Ritz Paris on Oct.?11 for a summit arranged by the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs, a think tank run by Fabien Baussart, a French businessman known for ties to Russian oligarchs who has made overtures to Russia to resolve the conflict.\n[ Moscow had contacts with Trump team during the campaign, says Russia ]\nThe meeting also posed questions about the Trump campaignâ€™s contact with nongovernmental foreign officials and operatives before the election.?The campaign confirmed that the meeting, first reported in the Wall Street Journal, took place.?\nJust days after the election, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said government officials had conferred with members of Trumpâ€™s campaign, an assertion later denied by his spokeswoman Hope Hicks.\nThe president-elect has spoken frequently about cooperating with Russia to fight the Islamic State militant group, rather than following the current U.S. policy of supporting rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Moscowâ€™s longtime ally.????\nPutin has committed to supporting Assadâ€™s regime, which has ruled out any deal with the rebel groups that the United States has supported. Russia describes all rebel groups as â€œterrorists,â€? and Trumpâ€™s blanket statements about joining Russia have been seen in Moscow as tacitly supporting this view.?\nOn Wednesday, Putin again expressed hope that Trumpâ€™s election would herald better relations between Moscow and Washington.\nâ€œNow that the election campaign in the United States is over and a new president is about to move into the White House, it is to be hoped that there will emerge a chance to establish relations crucial not only to both countries, but also to ensure international stability and security,â€? he said at the international forum in Moscow.\nPutin did not mention Syria in the comments, but it looms as one of the critical tests for any possible shifts by Washington.\nAfter the election, Russia kicked off a massive aerial and missile assault on Syrian rebel positions, just hours after Putin and Trump, speaking by phone, agreed to combine efforts in Syria to defeat what Moscow has said is its enemy in the fight: â€œinternational terrorism and extremism.â€??\nRanda Kassis, Baussartâ€™s Syrian-born wife, documented the Paris meeting with Trump Jr. on her Facebook page. She is the president of the Movement of the Pluralistic Society, a Syrian opposition group endorsed by Moscow that advocates working with Assad.\nâ€œWith Trump as the newly elected president, we can work to find a way to stop this war and start this political process,â€? Kassis told The Washington Post. â€œFor me, [Hillary] Clinton was really the worst and could be the worst president concerning this fire in the Middle East ? she supported Islamists, and when she was secretary of state, she armed Islamists on the ground in Syria.â€???\nOn Nov. 8, Kassis met with Bogdanov and,?according to the Russian Foreign Ministry, â€œexchanged views on developments in Syria and around it, pointing to the need for an early political settlement of the Syrian crisis.â€??\nThe next day, she heralded Trumpâ€™s surprise election victory over Clinton in Russian state-controlled media, telling the Sputnik news agency that she had been in contact with him through his son. â€œI succeed to pass to Trump, through the talks with his son, the idea of how we can cooperate together to reach the agreement between Russia and the United States on Syria,â€? she said.\nKassis noted that, before the election, the group had also invited James Rubin, a former State Department spokesman and informal adviser tothe Clinton campaign.\nTrump never accepted U.S. allegations that the Kremlin was?interfering in the presidential election , even after the Obama administration accused Russia. Instead, the billionaire real estate developer staked out positions that were friendly to the Kremlin, calling for closer ties with Moscow.\nThere have been questions about whether Trumpâ€™s ties with Russia might be influenced by his business interests there. He made millions of dollars by taking the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013, and Trump Jr. said in 2008 that â€œRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.â€? In the second presidential debate, though, Trump categorically denied having business interests in Russia.\nSeveral Trump advisers also had well-publicized ties to Russia, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort . Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a Trump national security adviser, sat next to Putin last year during a dinner held by the Kremlin-funded television channel RT, formerly known as Russia Today.\nDuring the election campaign, Trump said Putin had â€œbeen a leader far more than our president [Obama] has been.â€?\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

(Anatolii Stepanov/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)\nSens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), co-chairs of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, today led a bipartisan group of 27 senators to call on President-elect Donald Trump to continue Americaâ€™s tradition of support for the people of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. In a letter, they told Trump:\nAlmost three years after Russiaâ€™s illegal annexation of Crimea and military aggression in eastern Ukraine, daily ceasefire violations along the line of contact make a mockery of the Minsk Agreement and demonstrate that this conflict in the heart of Europe is far from over. Russia has yet to withdraw its heavy weapons and continues its sabotage and subversion efforts. It has not halted its disinformation war against Ukraine and the West, nor stopped its economic and political pressure aimed at undermining the Ukrainian government. According to conservative estimates from the United Nations, approximately 10,000 people have been killed, over 20,000 wounded, and more than two million internally displaced since the conflict began. And, unfortunately, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observers still do not have full, unimpeded access to the Ukrainian-Russian border while Russia continues to supply weapons, equipment, and personnel to the separatists.\nOne does wonder if Trump has been presented with these basic facts, or if, like?with?Russian hacking , Trump chooses not to believe reality.?Dubbing Russiaâ€™s actions â€œa military land-grab in Ukraine that is unprecedented in modern European history,â€? these senators advise:\nThese actions in Crimea and other areas of eastern Ukraine dangerously upend well-established diplomatic, legal, and security norms that the United States and its NATO allies painstakingly built over decades ? a historically bipartisan global security framework that has greatly served US security and economic interests. We believe it is in our vital national security interest to uphold these norms and values, and prevent Americaâ€™s commitment to its allies and ideals from being called into question.\nIn light of Russiaâ€™s continued aggression and repeated refusal to respect Ukraineâ€™s territorial integrity and sovereign right to choose its own destiny, we also renew our call for the United States to increase political, economic, and military support for Ukraine. This includes defensive lethal assistance as part of a broader effort to help Ukrainians better defend themselves, deter future aggression, and implement key structural reforms. Similarly, we believe that Russiaâ€™s illegal annexation of Crimea should never be accepted, nor should we lift sanctions imposed on Russia for its behavior in eastern Ukraine until key provisions of the Minsk Agreement are met. Accordingly, US leadership on maintaining such transatlantic sanctions should remain a priority.\nThe letter is revealing on multiple fronts.\nFirst, with President Obama leaving, Democrats are now much more willing to engage in vocal criticism of policies that seem only to have encouraged Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s aggression. Bipartisanship is all to the good here, and signals a level of seriousness about congressional oversight and funding to the incoming administration. As Trump flounders around looking for a secretary of state, the letter provides ammunition, if you will, to Russia hawks who may need to push back on Russia sycophants such as retired Lt. Gen.?Michael T. Flynn , the incoming national security adviser.\nSecond, while Republicans on the Hill have refused to push back on the domestic agenda or on Trumpâ€™s glaring conflicts of interest , foreign policy (be it on setting off a tariff war or cozying up to Putin) seems to be a different matter. Credit goes to Republican lawmakers such as?Portman and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) who do not seem willing to trim their sails to stay in Trumpâ€™s good graces.\nFinally, the language of the letter ? its bluntness and clarity ? contrasts with the outgoing administrationâ€™s effort to deflect and reduce ire toward Russia, which often sounded like it was providing PR help to Russia. The administration, for example, took no significant action when it was determined that a civilian airliner was shot down by Russian-backed forces with a surface-to-air missile delivered from Russia . Because both Putin and Trump eagerly misstate or ignore realities that do not fit their agenda, clarity from Congress is all the more important. If Trump wants to defend a â€œmilitary land-grab in Ukraine,â€? let him; but letâ€™s not let him get away with ignoring or excusing Russiaâ€™s violation of a neighborâ€™s sovereignty.\nAs we have said, autocratic leaders must obscure the truth and make facts fungible so as to escape scrutiny for their actions. If Congress can prevent Putin and his admirer Trump from such obfuscation, it would provide a great service to Western democracies.\nopinions\n	washingtonpost	World

Even in an era of political upsets, this oneâ€™s a long shot.?\nAlexei Navalny, the opposition politician who helped lead street protests against Russian President Vladimir Putin here in 2011, announced Tuesday that he would run for president of Russia in 2018, sending a rare jolt of electricity through Russiaâ€™s subdued opposition.?\nâ€œI will take part in elections for the presidency of Russia,â€? the vocal critic of Putin declared in a video released on the Internet. â€œGenuine elections are not just the victory of one person. Theyâ€™re a clash of ideas, competition between programs.â€?\nNavalnyâ€™s candidacy, the first declared by?any politician, marks the beginning a long election cycle that seems headed for one, inevitable conclusion: a victor anointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThereâ€™s a good chance that will be Putin himself.\nBut the Russian leader, who turned 64 in October, has not said whether he will stand for reelection. He has served as president of Russia for three terms since 2000, a perpetual administration broken only by a stint as prime minister. He has no heir apparent.\nMuch has changed since Navalny, an anti-corruption activist who used his status as an investor in state companies to expose corruption, emerged as a leader of Russiaâ€™s â€œWhite Ribbonâ€? protests in 2011.\nThe demonstrations, mainly in Moscow, united left- and right-wing political activists with ?middle-class and liberal intelli?gentsia in a rare outburst of anger at Putinâ€™s return that year to the presidency.?\nSince then, Russia has annexed Crimea, to the delight of Putinâ€™s base; coordination between?opposition groups has collapsed; and demonstrators have been targeted in criminal cases, with some receiving years of hard time in Russian prisons. Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister and one of Putinâ€™s most vocal critics, was gunned down in sight of the Kremlin in 2015.\nNavalnyâ€™s brother Oleg was sentenced to 3? years in jail on embezzlement charges in 2014. Alexei also was charged in several prosecutions that he called politically motivated and received a suspended sentence for embezzlement in 2013.\nConvicted criminals?cannot run for president?in Russia. But the conviction was overturned this year after criticism by the European Court on Human Rights. Navalny is facing a ?retrial; a guilty verdict will end his candidacy.\nPolitical commentators said that his?candidacy raises the stakes of the trial, tying the verdict to the 2018 elections.\nIn his 3? -minute video, Navalny seemed to consciously avoid using the name of the leader who has wielded power in the Kremlin for just about a generation.\nâ€œUnfortunately, weâ€™ve already become accustomed to the fact that elections decide nothing,â€? he said. â€œThose who are now in power have been there for 17 years and have stopped responding to any criticism.â€?\nRead more\n	washingtonpost	World

The tensions were exposed over the weekend: Trump belittled the CIA after a Washington Post report that the agency believed that Moscow favored Trump in the election, and several Republicans, including Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), joined with Democrats to call for an investigation into the matter.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Dec. 11 reacted to the CIAâ€™s assessment that Russia intervened to help Trump win the election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\nâ€œThe Russians are not our friends,â€? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters Monday, voicing his support for an inquiry.\nMcConnell stopped short of endorsing a special select committee investigation, as some lawmakers have suggested, but said that the Senate Intelligence Committee is equipped to take on the matter.\nâ€œThis simply cannot be a partisan issue,â€? he said.\nMcConnell also appeared to break with Trump in his assessment of the CIA, saying that he has â€œthe highest confidenceâ€? in the intelligence community and that the CIA is â€œfilled with selfless patriots, many of whom anonymously risk their lives for the American people.â€?\nMcConnell, meanwhile, declined to defend Tillerson against accusations that he is too close with Russia, telling reporters that he would not comment on a hypothetical â€œphantom nominee.â€?\nMcConnellâ€™s reluctance to engage on Tillerson came after some of his allies on national security issues, including Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), raised doubts about the ExxonMobil chiefâ€™s background.\nOn Tuesday, Rubio expressed â€œserious concernsâ€? about Tillersonâ€™s nomination, noting that Americaâ€™s top diplomat must be â€œfree of potential conflicts of interest.â€? Rubio, however, left open room for compromise, saying he looked forward to â€œlearning more about [Tillersonâ€™s] record and his views.â€?\n1 of 22\nHereâ€™s a look at Trumpâ€™s administration so far\nView Photos\nPresident-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration.\nCaption\nPresident-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration.\nSecretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson Rex Tillerson is the chief executive of ExxonMobil, but leading Republicans have expressed reservations about President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for secretary of state because of his work in Russia and the Middle East on behalf of the petroleum company.

The agreement has been frozen since the United States imposed sanctions on Moscow after Russiaâ€™s 2014 incursion into Ukraine.\nSome senior GOP advisers fear that the Tillerson-Putin relationship will make Republicans reluctant to support the nomination. One adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said as many as seven might now be unwilling to vote to confirm him as the nationâ€™s top diplomat.\nMcCain said he would give Tillerson a fair hearing if the oil executive is nominated, but on Monday the senator questioned his judgment for being close to the Russian president. Putin â€œis a thug and a murderer,â€? McCain said on CNN, â€œand I donâ€™t see how anybody could be a friend of this old-time KGB agent.â€?\nD.J. Jordan, a spokesman for Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), said Monday that the lawmaker â€œhas a lot of questions about Mr. Tillerson and his ties to Russia,â€? though he added that Lankford is â€œhopeful that those questions will be addressed in the days ahead.â€?\nA big test for Republicans\nTaken together, the tensions between the president-elect and fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill reflect a major test for how the GOP congressional majorities will handle the unusual circumstances of the Trump era. Republicans, many of whom opposed Trump during the presidential primaries, want to work with him in many areas and avoid alienating his enthusiastic voter base. Yet some in the GOP are also assessing how to fulfill their constitutional duties as a check on a businessman-president who is unaccustomed to the public scrutiny inherent to a democratic system and unconcerned with past traditions of transparency, particularly when it comes to his personal finances. They also must prepare for the potential that Trump, who has effectively harnessed Twitter to skewer his critics, could turn his ire toward them.\nDemocrats, for their part, have little power to investigate Trump or thwart his nominations. In 2013, Democrats ? angered by what they described as years of Republican obstruction ? voted to scrap the rule requiring at least 60 senators to overcome a procedural hurdle and move to a final confirmation vote. Now, all of Trumpâ€™s nominees for the executive and judicial branches, with the exception of picks for the Supreme Court, can be confirmed on a simple majority vote.\nWith 48 seats in the Senate, Democrats in that chamber need to win over only a handful of Republicans to block a nominee, though doing so requires a degree of Democratic unity. That could be difficult, with 10 of the partyâ€™s senators facing reelection in two years in states that Trump won.\nIncoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and his leadership team have urged senators set to serve as ranking Democrats on top national security, financial and ?domestic-policy committees to focus on hiring professional investigators able to quickly dive into the personal and financial backgrounds of Trumpâ€™s nominees, according to a senior Democratic aide. The hope is that Democrats will be able to dig up dirt on Trumpâ€™s nominees just as Republicans did to some of President Obamaâ€™s high-profile nominees in the early days of his administration.\nThe larger drama is likely to take place among congressional Republicans, who will face pressure to help Trump. So far, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) has demonstrated a reluctance to challenge the ?president-elect on some of the issues that have animated his GOP colleagues.\nOn Monday, Ryan dismissed calls for a probe into Russian meddling in the election, saying the House Intelligence Committee is â€œworking diligently on the cyber threats posed by foreign governments and terrorist organizations.â€? He also appeared to criticize suggestions that Russia favored Trump, saying in a statement that â€œexploiting the work of our intelligence community for partisan purposes does a grave disservice to those professionals and potentially jeopardizes national security,â€? and â€œwe should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election.â€?\nRyan also has waved off concerns about Trumpâ€™s potential conflicts of interest related to his global real estate and branding empire. Asked last week by a CNBC interviewer how he hoped the president-elect would handle his business after he takes office, Ryan said, â€œHowever he wants to.â€?\nâ€œThis is not what Iâ€™m concerned about in Congress,â€? he said.\nTrump had planned a news conference Thursday to reveal how he will handle the business while he is in office, but his transition team said Monday that he will do it next month. Trump has hinted that he will retain an ownership stake while putting his adult children in charge of the companyâ€™s operations,
 telling â€œFox News Sundayâ€? that â€œessentially Iâ€™m not going to have anything to do with the management.â€?\nLate Friday night,Trump tweeted that he will hand over control of his businesses to his two adult sonâ€™s before Jan. 20.\nEthics experts and lawmakers in both parties have warned that if Trump retains his stake, he will face congressional hearings and, potentially, investigations into whether he has a direct and personal financial stake in the decisions he is supposed to be making in the public interest. They say that Trumpâ€™s refusal to release his tax returns has left the public largely in the dark about the full extent of the potential conflicts.\nâ€œTurning it over to his family and him still being a recipient of fruits of their labor does create conflicts in my mind,â€? said Graham, the GOP senator from South Carolina. â€œIt will cloud his presidency if he doesnâ€™t find a solution that puts it behind him.â€?\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a member of the House Oversight Committee and the new chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, told The Post last week that he expects Trump to divorce himself from the business â€œas much as you can have a blind trust and fully divest.â€?\nâ€œHe has more counselors around him, with plenty of law degrees, that will give him great counsel on how to stay out of trouble,â€? Meadows said. He added that he expected Trump to build the proper firewall, but that â€œwe have an oversight function that would be appropriate, and from my standpoint I think itâ€™s incumbent upon the Oversight Committee to look at everything without a partisan lens.â€?\nâ€˜Vigorous oversightâ€™\nThe chairman of the oversight panel, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), said it was premature to consider any sort of investigation, but he said the committee would provide â€œvigorous oversightâ€? of the new president.\nâ€œHeâ€™s still a private citizen at this point, though he needs to get his affairs in order,â€? Chaffetz said. â€œGive him a little breathing space, I think thatâ€™s fair.â€?\nEthics experts have called for Trump to appoint an independent trustee, unconnected to his family, to lead an effort to sell his assets and reinvest the proceeds without his knowledge. Trump has appeared to brush off concerns about conflicts, noting that there is no legal requirement that he separate.\nâ€œWhen I ran, everybody knew that I was a very big owner of real estate all over the world,â€? Trump told Fox Newsâ€™s Chris Wallace in an interview that aired Sunday. â€œI mean, Iâ€™m not going to have anything to do with the management of the company. You know, when you sell real estate thatâ€™s not like going out and selling a stock. That takes a long time. . . . Iâ€™m going to have nothing to with it. And Iâ€™ll be honest with you ? I donâ€™t care about it anymore.â€?\nTrump said he was â€œturning down billions of dollars of dealsâ€? as he prepares to take office. â€œIâ€™m not going to be doing deals at all,â€? he said. â€œNow that would be ? I donâ€™t even know if thatâ€™s a conflict. I mean, I have the right to do it. You know, under the law, I have the right to do it. I just donâ€™t want to do it. I donâ€™t want to do deals, because I want to focus on this.â€?\nSeveral lawmakers who would be responsible for probing potential conflicts of interest said in recent interviews they are willing to give the incoming president time and space to figure out how he will deal with the situation.\nâ€œWe havenâ€™t even started the next Congress and we havenâ€™t seen exactly how President-elect Trump is going to handle all this,â€? said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who leads the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee with jurisdiction over investigations. â€œIâ€™m going to give him and his administration time to figure out what, quite honestly, is a very difficult situation.â€?\nIn other corners of the GOP, lawmakers say the calls to investigate Trump are coming primarily from his political opponents.\nâ€œThere are going to be detractors from Trump [who] are going to try to make it sound like all the conflict of interest and all of that, and I donâ€™t think people are really concerned about that except just the activists you run into on the Hill,â€? said Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.).\nâ€œIf itâ€™s going to be those who just hate Trump and are looking for something to do him in or lessen his effectiveness ? thatâ€™s not going to happen,â€? he added.\nRosalind S.

(Delil Souleiman/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)\nAs Syrian fighters?push toward the Islamic Stateâ€™s de-facto capital of Raqqa in northern Syria, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter announced Saturday that additional U.S. Special Operations forces will head into the country to help the fledgling offensive.\nThe additional 200 troops will bolster the 300 or so already in the country, although the number is likely to fluctuate as forces move between Syria and neighboring Iraq. Carter, speaking at a conference in Bahrain, said the forces?would include trainers, advisers and explosives specialists.\nOther western countries, such as France, also have Special Operations units in the country.\n[ Pentagon expands Syria force ahead of assault on militant capital ]\nâ€œThe increase is tied to the growing number of local forces now willing to participate in this fight, and our efforts to enable them,â€? a senior defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss troop deployments, said in an email before Carterâ€™s remarks.\nIt is unclear which particular U.S. Special Operations forces are operating in Syria, however the bulk of the U.S. troops?in Syria are probably Army Special Forces?from Fifth?Special Forces Group along with a mixture of Air Force forward air controllers and other Special Operations units. Fifth Groupâ€™s primary area of responsibility is the Middle East and North Africa, and it has helped train Syrian fighters in the past. The unit was the first conventional military force?to enter Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks.\nLast month, Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Scott Dayton, an explosive ordnance disposal technician, was killed by a roadside bomb northwest of Raqqa. A tribute to Dayton posted on Facebook identified him as being part of?Fifth Group in Syria. His attachment to the unit was confirmed by a U.S. military official familiar with the matter.\nA recent article in the Washington Times also pointed to some members of Fifth Group that are growing?increasingly?frustrated?toward?their higher-ups for their propensity to?micromanage from afar. In an email to the Times, Fifth Groupâ€™s commander, Col. Kevin C. Leahy addressed the complaint, saying his troops were right to say their mission is â€œtop heavyâ€? with support personnel.\nâ€œThere is a sizable amount of people required to provide intel, fires, logistics and vetting of rebels/groups, liaison with host nation partners, U.S. country teams, etc.,â€? Leahy said in the email. â€œThe teams really are the tip of an inverse triangle of support/[headquarters] needed to enable the mission.â€?\n[ Obama outlines plans to expand U.S. Special Operations forces in Syria ]\nIn May, after images on social media of U.S. Special Operations forces in Syria wearing Kurdish patches surfaced, the Pentagon made the troops remove them to avoid?angering Turkey.\nSpecial Forces, or Green Berets, specialize in training and advising local forces, a mission known as Foreign Internal Defense, or FID. Images sporadically posted online from local media and individuals on the ground often?show what appear to be American?forces driving in suburbans and pickup trucks alongside their Syrian?counterparts, easily identifiable by their equipment and camouflage patterns.\nThese troops are â€œtraining, advising and assisting,â€? according to the Pentagon, a line that is often emphasized to reiterate that Americans are not on the front lines fighting the Islamic State and are instead guiding local troops. This approach often runs contrary to how U.S. forces have advised in the past, such as in Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam, where?U.S. troops would operate directly alongside those who they had been tasked to advise.\nDespite the Pentagonâ€™s insistence, footage routinely appears of U.S. troops on or near the front guiding airstrikes . In some cases, it is clear that U.S. Special Operation forces are using specific antitank weapons to take out approaching explosive-laden suicide vehicles.\n[ U.S. Special Operations forces begin new role alongside Turkish troops in Syria ]\nThe newest tranche of Special Operations forces headed to Syria represents?the third time since October 2015 that the Pentagon has committed more troops there. The initial deployment was billed as a small group of about 50 that would look for local forces that could potentially fight the Islamic State. The second deployment, announced in April, was for 250 troops that would partner with the forces identified and initially assisted by the first detachment. Now, with approximately 500 of the elite forces in Syria, it means U.S. forces will be able to better manage the local forces they?are embedded with, meaning troop movements probably will go?smoother, and targeting for airstrikes could occur in more places than before.\nThe local?forces fighting alongside the Americans and other western troops are an amalgamation of Kurdish and?Arab fighters known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. From its inception in late 2015, the SDF has primarily comprised Kurdish Peopleâ€™s Protection Units, or YPG. The SDFâ€™s predominantly Kurdish composition has been worrying for neighboring Turkey, who sees the YPG as being directly aligned with the Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party, or PKK ? which is recognized by both the United States and Turkey as a terrorist group.\nRecruiting and training Arab fighters into the SDF has been one of the top priorities for U.S. forces, as taking back Raqqa from the Islamic State with a mostly Kurdish force could?be potentially problematic to the cityâ€™s residents and Turkey.\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters, along with Turkish troops, are also fighting in Syria, but they are concentrated to the west around the town of al-Bab.\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	World

There will be no further comment at this stage.â€?\nMichael was an international pop icon in the 1980s who then became an even more?a successful solo act.

The duo broke up in 1986.\nIn his solo years, he became known as a more serious singer who had massive hits such as â€œFaith,â€? â€œFather Figureâ€? and â€œI Want Your Sex.â€? The London-born singer sold more than 100 million albums over the course of his career.\nMichael had been out of the spotlight for the last several years, after a life-threatening bout of pneumonia in 2011. â€œIâ€™m a new man,â€? he told the British press after he recovered, adding, â€œI have an amazing, amazing life, and if I wasnâ€™t spiritual enough before the last four, five weeks then I certainly am now.â€?\nAs news of Michaelâ€™s death broke, tributes started pouring in on social media:\nRest with the glittering stars, George Michael.

(Evert Elzinga/AFP/Getty Images)\nGeorge Michael was given only 53 years in this world, but he made them count. He was still a teenager in 1982 when he began triggering worldwide endorphin-rushes as a member of Wham! Five years and a few hairstyles later, he went solo, wiggled the backside of his Leviâ€™s on MTV and became a global sex symbol. By the time 2004 rolled around, he was staging a big comeback at age 40, and he divulged the riddle of his craft that year in the pages of British GQ: â€œPeople have always thought I wanted to be seen as a serious musician, but I didnâ€™t, I just wanted people to know that I was absolutely serious about pop music.â€??\nHe had recently?issued what would be his fifth and final studio album, â€œPatience,â€? a sensuous, sprawling meditation on sex, war, grief and commitment. Playful one moment and contemplative the next, the album seemed to give Michael an opportunity to sort out some important truths about pop itself: that our pleasure is not frivolous, and that heavy ideas travel further when theyâ€™re floating on bright melodies.\nNow ? after the British superstar died of heart failure in his home on Christmas Day ? Michaelâ€™s legacy seems to run in poignant parallel to those of other pop gods we lost in 2016. Like Prince, he sang about the transcendental potential of human sexuality, and like David Bowie, he sought liberation through reinvention. In 1987, Michael donned an iconic leather jacket in the music video for â€œFaith.â€? Three years later, he was burning it on a coat hanger in his video for â€œFreedom â€™90.â€? Fantastic.\nGeorge Michael leaves a news conference for the film â€œGeorge Michael ? A Different Storyâ€? in Berlin in February 2005. (Tobias Schwarz/Reuters)\nAnd if freedom was what Michael was preaching in 1990, freedom is what we were hearing on â€œPatienceâ€? in 2004. In the years leading up to the album, he broke ranks with other zip-lipped superstars, writing and performing antiwar songs, including â€œShoot the Dog,â€? a dance floor satire that skewered Tony Blair and George W. Bush. But in the context of â€œPatience,â€? the teasing mood of â€œShoot the Dogâ€? clashed powerfully with the albumâ€™s title track, a ballad about feeling blinkered by the war machine. Fingertips barely touching the piano, Michael asks, â€œIs it my imagination, or did God already leave the table?â€?\nThatâ€™s the kind of lyric that sends you scrambling back through an artistâ€™s songbook, searching for everything you missed the first time around. (And about that: Has there ever been an opening line more deliciously flirty than, â€œWell, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your bodyâ€??)?\n1 of 18\n	washingtonpost	World

(Neal Ulevich/AP)\nAs one-half of Wham! and as a solo artist, George Michael left behind a peerless collection of sticky-sweet pop singles ? but also earnest, risque and melancholy songs. Most of what his detractors couldnâ€™t stand about him were precisely the things that his fans loved: his bleeding-heart sincerity, his indefatigable cheerfulness. In 2016, itâ€™s easy to see these things as relics of a bygone era, but they stuck out in his late-1980s heyday, too. In the throes of a Britain sharply divided over Thatcherism, Michaelâ€™s brand of optimistic pop sounded naive, even ignorant.\nTime would reveal that it was actually brave.\nMichael and friend Andrew Ridgeley initially formed a ska band in 1979. The band was a bust, but Michael and Ridgeley reemerged as Wham! and sent a demo to an upstart independent label called Innervision, which loved the sound. They fast-tracked a debut album called â€œFantasticâ€? that spawned a quick hit in â€œWham Rap!â€?\nâ€œWham Rap!â€? was stupid fun, teenage girls loved it, and the song became a minor hit. More important, Michael and Ridgeley were an easy sell: young, handsome, funny and known for taking the stage with open suede jackets and shuttlecocks stuffed down the fronts of their jeans. They soon realized that they were getting a raw deal from Innervision, so they got out of their contract and onto a new label by forfeiting all future profits from their debut album. That would have seemed like a rash move if Wham! had proved to be a one-hit wonder, as so many of their starry-eyed contemporaries ended up being. Suffice to say, Wham! was not a one-hit wonder. Their first single under their new label was â€œ Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go .â€?\nIf you donâ€™t know anything else about Wham!, you know that song. It tells you a lot of what you need to know about the group, and Michael in particular. It sounds like a Sondheim number, like everyone should start pirouetting on restaurant tables when it plays. Itâ€™s candy, if youâ€™re into that sort of thing. If youâ€™re not, itâ€™s positively diabolical.\nEnough people were into that sort of thing in the mid-â€™80s to make Wham! a global sensation, rivaling Culture Club for the mantle of Britainâ€™s most popular pop act of the â€™80s. But the smoldering anger among Britainâ€™s disaffected alternative scene meant Wham! would forever be barred from a certain level of hip respectability and critical acclaim. The Smiths debuted the same year that â€œWake Me Up Before You Go-Goâ€? dropped, and while critics liked Wham!, they loved the Smiths. Serious music was trending toward nuclear panic and political angst. In the face of this, Wham!â€™s output was written off as a bit juvenile.\nHowever, Michael was a much savvier musician than he was getting credit for at the time. His later career as a solo artist, with songs such as â€œFreedom â€™90,â€? â€œFather Figureâ€? and â€œPraying for Time,â€? would solidify his place as a sophisticated talent, but heads were scratched in 1983 when he appeared on a talk show called â€œEight Days a Weekâ€? and gushed about Joy Divisonâ€™s haunting, melancholy â€œCloser .â€? Anyone paying attention could see that his finger was firmly on the pulse of the moment heâ€™d found himself a major player in. He just chose to respond with defiant optimism instead of brooding rage.\nIndeed, Michaelâ€™s trademark â€œ CHOOSE LIFEâ€? T-shirt ? a work of?political-firebrand-cum-designer Katharine Hamnett ? wasnâ€™t intended to be an antiabortion statement. Rather, it was?a willful call to hope in the face of daunting odds. Britain was then (as it is today) sharply politically polarized by generation. Michael and many of his contemporaries were opposed to Margaret Thatcherâ€™s conservative policies, and bands were finding themselves increasingly on the front lines of the rebellion. As a precursor to the then-nascent boy band era, Wham! wasnâ€™t really expected to get involved in the fight, but it did anyway. The duo played a gig at a benefit for? striking miners , a hugely and surprisingly political move from a band at the peak of its fame. (Imagine, for instance, Ariana Grande showing up at a Chicago teachers union strike.)\nMichael was in Britainâ€™s gooey pop scene, but he wasnâ€™t of it. As he would famously tell Rolling Stone in 1988 , â€œIf you listen to a Supremes record or a Beatles record, which were made in the days when pop was accepted as an art of sorts, how can you not realize that the elation of a good pop record is an art form? Somewhere along the way, pop lost all its respect. And I think I kind of stubbornly stick up for all of that.â€? Michael believed in pop. He believed it had power. There are lots of people who fancy themselves as too good for pop music, but lots who donâ€™t. And Michael made music for them.\nAnd he lived his boundless optimism, too. In the wake of his death, dozens of stories have popped up on social media about Michaelâ€™s generosity, from four-figure tips for struggling waitresses to anonymous volunteer shifts at homeless shelters. These stories are hard to verify, but Michaelâ€™s fondness for giving to charity is well known. Whether it was a? free concert for National Health Service nurses as a thank you for taking care of his mother, or a? secret donation to a â€œDeal or No Dealâ€? contestant who needed medical treatment, Michael wasnâ€™t content in a bubble of hope, but lived to spread it to others. Every red cent of royalties that â€œLast Christmasâ€? earned went to Ethiopian famine relief .\nAnd then there was his work for the LGBT community. Rumors swirled around Michaelâ€™s sexuality for most of his career until he finally confirmed after a run-in with police in Beverly Hills that he was gay. He also opened up about one of his lifeâ€™s great tragedies ? a brief but passionate relationship with a Brazilian designer named Anselmo Feleppa that lasted from 1991 until Feleppaâ€™s death from an AIDS-related brain hemorrhage in 1993.\nMichael wrote â€œJesus to a Childâ€? for Feleppa and became a high-profile supporter of the Terrence Higgins Trust, an HIV charity. But nearly as important, he was a proudly gay celebrity in the 1990s, and that was no small thing. Given the benefit of hindsight, the buoyancy that characterized Wham! and some of Michaelâ€™s solo work seems even more profound. He was writing deliriously popular songs about love and heartache to a society that he knew would not fully embrace his own sexuality.\nAll of this makes for a much more multidimensional portrait of the boy with an open suede vest and a shuttlecock jammed in his jeans. But unlike so many instances of unearthed facts following a celebrity death, the details of Michaelâ€™s life only add to his appeal. Smiling in the face of adversity is no mean feat, and Michaelâ€™s only trick was to never let them see him sweat. Sure, it didnâ€™t look hard. Neither does a backflip, if you know what youâ€™re doing. Michael knew his music would probably never be taken as seriously as it deserved. But he also knew a stadium full of 90,000 screaming fans couldnâ€™t all be wrong.\n0\n	washingtonpost	World

The Empire Strikes Back.â€? (Lucasfilm/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images)\nUntil Carrie Fisher, â€œprincessâ€? was a dirty word.\nBefore â€œStar Wars,â€? I had seen princesses. I was a little girl, and when you are a little girl, all anyone seems to want to do is to show you princesses to emulate. I wanted no part of it. Princesses were things who got rescued. Princesses wore pink. Princesses sat in castles waiting for their dragons to go off duty and their knights in shining armor to come to the rescue. Princesses were?dreamy and spoke softly and little birds alighted on their arms and they brushed out their long golden hair and sang and they didnâ€™t crack jokes and they didnâ€™t get frustrated and they most certainly didnâ€™t take matters into their own hands and rescue themselves.\nAnd then I saw â€œStar Wars,â€? and Princess Leia, and suddenly â€œprincessâ€? meant something altogether different. She was not an object to be rescued. She was someone we saw from the inside.\nâ€œArenâ€™t you a little short for a stormtrooper?â€??Princess Leia?asks her would-be rescuer.\nâ€œIâ€™m Luke Skywalker,â€? he announces. â€œIâ€™m here to rescue you.â€?\nâ€œYouâ€™re?who?â€?\nIn a few moments, she is the only one with a plan, leading everyone to temporary safety in a?garbage chute. (â€œSomebody,â€? she notes, â€œhas to save our skins.â€?)\nBirds donâ€™t land on her arms. She doesnâ€™t sing (except on â€œ SNL â€? and in the Christmas special, of which the less said, the better). She doesnâ€™t take guff. She is, in short, a real, full-fledged person, a survivor, capable, smart and worthy of love.\nBut?Carrie Fisher, whom we lost Tuesday, was so much more than just Princess Leia?(or?even General Organa). What made Carrie Fisher such a wonderful presence was that hers?was a writerâ€™s mind dropped in the midst of a fascinating story. Born showbiz royalty as the daughter of?Debbie Reynolds?and Eddie Fisher?(who left Reynolds for Elizabeth Taylor and â€œbasically fled the scene of the accident,â€? as Carrie Fisher quipped), she wound up starring?in perhaps the biggest film franchise of all time.?She had a life few people on Earth could imagine?? until she wrote about it, and then you were right there, seeing it all and laughing with her.\nShe was a novelist ? her â€œ Postcards From the Edge ,â€? which drew on her own experience in a showbiz family, brimmed with wit and became a movie starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine ? and a memoirist and a raconteur, and her greatest gift was sharing the wild ride she was on with anyone who cared to listen.\nLook back at the life and accomplishments of the best-selling author and "Star Wars" actress. (Gillian Brockell,Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)\nYou could always tell there was a real human being?in there beneath the silly space hair ? one with a sharp wit and an observerâ€™s eye. She did not take fame seriously, and through her writings demystified it, often hilariously.?She shared?too, with warmth and courage, her experiences of loss and mental illness.?Her life?was an open book, and?it was fantastically well-written.\nHer much-quoted account, from â€œ Wishful Drinking ,â€? of why George Lucas wouldnâ€™t let her wear a bra remains one of the funniest things ever. (â€œGeorge came up to me the first day of filming, took one look at the dress and said: â€˜You canâ€™t wear a bra under that dress.â€™ â€˜OK, Iâ€™ll bite,â€™ I said. â€˜Why?â€™ And he said: â€˜Because â€¦ thereâ€™s no underwear in space.â€™ He said it with such conviction. Like he had been to space and looked around and he didnâ€™t see any bras or panties anywhere. He explained, â€˜You go into space and you become weightless. Then your body expands but your bra doesnâ€™t, so you get strangled by your own underwear.â€™ I think that this would make a fantastic obituary. I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.â€?)\nAnd she imbued Leia with these qualities, too. Leia is not just an amazing female?character but a great character, full stop: strong and vulnerable and funny and kind, with causes she is willing to fight for ? with a blaster or even a spear if necessary.\nA lot of what I know about how to be a person in the world I learned from Princess Leia ??and, when I got old enough to separate the actress from the character, from Carrie Fisher herself. Both had a remarkable gift for cutting through nonsense. Fisher poked fun at her own performance and Leiaâ€™s â€œviralâ€? faux British accent that â€œcame and went.â€? She wielded a wit like Dorothy Parkerâ€™s, with the same gift for the piercing phrase (â€œInstant gratification takes too longâ€?) and the apt pun ? she described the experience of a manic episode as â€œI was trapped in a metaphor. Everything I looked at had a meaning. Everything was a warning or a sign. â€¦ â€˜ Metaphors be with you.â€™ ?â€?? Carrieâ€™s account of?how Leia got into the?infamous gold bikini is:?â€œA giant slug captured me and forced me to wear that stupid outfit, and then I killed him because I didnâ€™t like it.â€? Thatâ€™s about right.\nShe gave Leia a voice of her own that extended even past the movies, one that was observant and tart and full of life. She didnâ€™t exist as a love interest or a sex object. She was her own person, and she would strangle Jabba the Hutt herself for making her wear that awful bikini, thank you very much. As Fisher told the audience at the Hay Festival , â€œI had a lot of fun killing Jabba the Hutt. They asked me on the day if I wanted to have a stunt double kill Jabba. No! Thatâ€™s the best time I ever had as an actor. And the only reason to go into acting is if you can kill a giant monster.â€?\nThe inadvertent high priestess of the â€œStar Warsâ€? cult, she was always cracking wise about her peculiar position as merchandise, sex symbol and mother figure to generations of fans. ( â€œI liked being a shampoo where you twist of my head and pour liquid out of my head â€¦ Iâ€™ve been licked like a stamp. Iâ€™ve been a robe.â€?)\nShe knew it was ridiculous. And she let us in on the joke. And we loved her for it. â€œYou feel like a camp reunion,â€? she quipped of â€œThe Force Awakens,â€? â€œonly Harrison and I look a little melted.â€™ â€?\nâ€œHan and I had a volatile relationship,â€? she?joked .? â€œWe have space estrangement. We had a child who turned out to be Hitler.â€?\nWhat a void her voice will leave.\nThe one consolation is that?losing a celebrity is always different from losing a real person. The way you know a famous person during their lifetime is not so different from the celluloid cenotaph they leave for you after death: the record of a life scrawled in light on a dark screen, the words on a page that peered into your life?and made you laugh, even while your heart was breaking.\nopinions\n	washingtonpost	World

Movies. Death. and a contributing author for "Star Wars Psychology" and the PsychGeek series of books.\nPrincess Leia was more than a princess, she was a hero in her own right. And Carrie Fisher was, too. (Reuters/Lucasfilm Ltd)\nI woke up this morning devastated by the news of Carrie Fisherâ€™s passing. Fisher was so many things: a writer, an actress, a script doctor, an author and one of the funniest women out there. She spoke frankly about her struggle with drugs and mental illness, letting people know it was okay to have flaws. She laughed at her own struggles, tweeting in 2011, â€œIf my life wasnâ€™t funny it would just be true and that is unacceptable.â€? Part of what she laughed at was the fame she earned playing Princess Leia in the â€œStar Warsâ€? films. It was not all she was, but the role she played changed everything for me, and for millions of little girls around the world.\nBack in the 1970s, girls didnâ€™t have a lot of strong role models in mainstream entertainment. The women we saw in films and on TV were waiting to be rescued or draped artistically over the hero. They were decoration, or prizes to be won. We read books and fairy tales where the only accomplishment of the lead female was to be lovely enough to catch someoneâ€™s eye. Even the smart ones were only smart until they found a man.\nLittle girls in the 1970s were lucky enough to find something different in Princess Leia. I was almost 4 when the film came out, and I saw it in the theater in 1977.\nâ€œStar Warsâ€? did something new with their lead. Leia wasnâ€™t just a princess to be won; Leia was a fighter in the rebellion against the evil Empire. She stood up to Darth Vader, despite seeing her entire planet blown to bits in front of her ? she barely even flinched when it happened. Leia survived Vaderâ€™s torture, and when Luke Skywalker and Han Solo came to rescue her, she took over and saved all of their skins. She ran the Rebel outpost on Hoth and, after trying to save Han, she strangled her captor, Jabba the Hutt, with her own slave chains. She later became a general in the fight for freedom. If you read any of the new canon books about her, you know just how vital she was to the rebellion for her entire life.\nYou cannot imagine what a revelation that was for me and for girls around the world. Many of us were sick of waiting for our prince to come or of playing in a toy kitchen or with plastic shopping carts. Many of us werenâ€™t okay with dolls in pink dresses and Barbie dream houses. We wanted to be part of the action. We wanted our actions to mean something. We wanted to fight.\n[ Princess Leia is a general now. Why isnâ€™t she in more toy stores? ]\nWhen I was a girl on the playground, I wasnâ€™t sitting on top of the monkey bars waiting to be rescued, or standing by politely with my hands folded like a good little princess. I took up my stick/blaster and fought the Stormtroopers and Darth Vader. When I saw something that was wrong, I did something about it. And why not? Leia didnâ€™t back down from anyone. She didnâ€™t always succeed, but she always tried, despite all the odds. Being in love was great, but it wasnâ€™t the only thing in her life. She risked her life to save the galaxy. Her friends mattered. Her cause mattered. She was certainly a better shot than those Stormtroopers.\nOnce I saw Leia, I was never going to sit quietly again. Leia inspired me to hold my head high and tell the world when something was wrong with the way women are portrayed. Because of Leia, I fight for equality. Because of Leia, I started my site, Legion of Leia , to tell the world that women love geek culture. I did it to shine a light on the things that were wrong in the world and to celebrate them when theyâ€™re right. Iâ€™m hardly alone. So many women of my generation can point to a picture of themselves dressed as Princess Leia as a kid. If you walk around any comic book convention, you see dozens of little girls with those iconic cinnamon-roll buns in their hair. It stirs my heart every time I see it.\nCarrie Fisher wasnâ€™t just Leia, of course. Her career encompassed so many parts of the entertainment industry. Her contribution to erasing the stigma around mental illness was enormous. Her humor kept us laughing with her through her struggles and her triumphs. She was a role model as Leia, but she was one as Carrie as well: Her positive attitude and raw honesty were a guiding example to me in my own career. Leia was (almost) the only woman in a group of men, and Fisher was one of the few female stars in the sci-fi world; that was something I could relate to, being one of the only women covering geekdom early on. She seemed to be able to find the ridiculous in the diciest of situations. If she could laugh at herself through it all, so could I. Her ability to do so much ? write books, act, pen advice columns and more ? encouraged?me to keep taking on different?projects until I found what I wanted to do. Leia was brave. So was Carrie.\nRest in peace, general. May the Force be with you.\n0\n	washingtonpost	World

Mui December 28 at 6:56 PM Follow @ylanmui\nPresident-elect Donald Trump says wireless carrier Sprint Corp will bring 5,000 jobs back to the United States. (The Washington Post)\n?\nPresident-elect Donald Trump provided new details Wednesday of his agreement with Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son to generate thousands of jobs in the United States, part of a string of unusually direct negotiations between Trump and corporate America.\nSpeaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump said telecom giant Sprint, which is owned by Tokyo-based Softbank, would take 5,000 jobs from other countries and move them to the United States.?But Sprint said the effort is more complex, and nearly all of its roughly 30,000 employees already work here.\nSpokesman David Tovar said the company had outsourced many of its customer service positions to third-party vendors with operations outside of the country. Sprint will request that those jobs be brought back to the country. In addition, it will hire new salespeople to staff its stores. It expects to complete the changes by the end of its 2017 fiscal year.\n?\nSprint Chief Executive Marcelo Claure told Trump of the company's plans in a phone call Wednesday.\nâ€œWe believe it is critical for business and government to partner together to create more job opportunities in the U.S. and ensure prosperity for all Americans,â€??Sprint Chief Executive?Marcelo Claure said.\nIn addition, Trump touted plans by Virginia-based startup OneWeb to create 3,000 jobs. Last week, OneWeb announced it had received $1 billion in financing from Softbank. The satellite company is building a new factory in Florida and expects to generate high-skilled manufacturing and engineering jobs across the country over the next four years.\nOn Wednesday, Trump said?bringing jobs back to the United States was â€œa nice changeâ€? and credited Son for the agreement. He also defended the announcement?of the deal.\n"Because of me they are doing 5,000 jobs in this country," Trump said.\nSon met with Trump in New York earlier this month at the president-electâ€™s transition team headquarters at Trump Tower. At that time, Son announced plans to invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 new jobs -- moves that Trump said were spurred by his upset presidential victory.\nOneWeb founder Greg Wyler said in an interview that he had been discussing potential funding with Softbank for several months. But after meeting with Trump, Son increased the size of the investment in OneWeb and the number of new hires, Wyler said. OneWeb aims to manufacture enough satellites at its new Florida facility to provide broadband access to every school in the world by 2022.\nâ€œI donâ€™t think the quantum and the drive would have happened at this level otherwise,â€? Wyler said.\nSprint said Wednesday that its 5,000 jobs were part of Sonâ€™s pledge but that the positions are being funded by Sprint, not Softbank.\nIn addition to its investment in OneWeb, Softbank announced in October that it had contributed $25 billion to an international fund to invest global technology companies over the next five years. The SoftBank Vision Fund also included capital from Saudi Arabia and outside investors.\n[ The dubious claims about SoftBankâ€™s investments in the U.S. ]\nTrumpâ€™s direct involvement in negotiating deals with individual companies has generated controversy over the role the president should play in shaping the economy. Trump enjoyed plenty of fanfare when he announced a deal to prevent a factory in Indiana from moving to Mexico but came under fire when he overestimated the number of jobs that would be saved. Trump publicly criticized Boeing for the high pricetag on Air Force One, forcing the companyâ€™s chief executive to promise last week to keep the cost down.\nConservative economists questioned Trumpâ€™s tactics, arguing that such efforts by the White House distort free markets. Democrats have cautioned that the deals could amount to corporate subsidies if they are accompanied by tax breaks or other preferential treatment.\nSon has been seeking to acquire rival carrier T-Mobile in what would be one of the largest telecom mergers in history. However, he abandoned the effort in 2014 after pushback from the Federal Communications Commission, which raised antitrust concerns.\nâ€œItâ€™s very important that at the outset of a new administration that legal doctrines that have been established for more than 100 years not be compromised with a desire to focus on opportunities for new jobs,â€? said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department official who now leads the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. â€œTheyâ€™re two separate issues, and they really should be kept that way.â€?\n?\n	washingtonpost	World

(Daniele Bennati/European Pressphoto Agency)\nAnis Amri, the Tunisian man suspected of driving a hijacked truck into a Berlin Christmas market on Monday, was fatally shot?by police in Milan during?the early hours of Friday morning. The shooting?ended a nearly four-day-long international manhunt after the terror attack killed 12 people\nThat conclusion could be seen as a success for?Europe's security authorities.?But?for many on the continent's far right, the location of the 24-year-old Tunisian's death is political ? and a sign that the European Union's "Schengen area," which allows for border-free travel within most of the union, has failed. After all, they point out, Amri was?able to not only leave Germany but cross through France before arriving in Italy.\n"If the man shot in Milan is the Berlin killer, then the Schengen Area is proven to be a risk to public safety," Nigel Farage, the firebrand anti-European British politician,? tweeted?on Friday . "It must go."\nNot long before Farage's message, Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far right National Front, published a blog post that dubbed the Schengen area a "security disaster," adding that France had been "reduced to learning after the fact that an armed and dangerous jihadist was probably wandering on its soil."\nMeanwhile, Beppe Grillo, leader of Italy's?euroskeptic Five Star Movement party, also wrote his own blog post?that praised the bravery of the policemen in Milan before adding that Italy had become a "pathway for terrorists" thanks to Schengen.\nThe Schengen area is?a grouping of 26 European nations that signed an agreement to abolish border controls between them and strengthen Europe's external borders. The 1995 agreement was originally separate to the European Union, but it has since become a part of E.U. law.\nAll but six E.U. nations have signed up, with the exception of Britain and Ireland, which?opted out, and four other newer E.U. member states that?are legally obligated to join. A number of non-E.U. states, such as Switzerland and Iceland, are also members. For many Europeans, the Schengen Area may be the most obvious example of European integration in their daily lives. In total, 400 million people can travel freely in an?area that?spans over 1.6 million square miles.\nGiven Europe's history of division, borderless travel has a symbolic component, too. With no border controls, it can start to feel like Europe is one large and diverse country rather than a continent made up of nation-states. Writing in French newspaper Le Figaro last year,?Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said the Schengen area was "one of our very greatest achievements."\nYet even Schengen's supporters admit it can create problems. The open borders?create opportunities for drugs and arms smuggling, making it easy and cheap to move illicit goods from one end of Europe to the other. â€œTen years ago you wouldn't have found Kalashnikovs in Western Europe,â€??Nils Duquet, senior weapons researcher at the?Flemish Peace Institute, recently told WorldViews .\nThe recent refugee crisis has placed even more strain on the system. A number of wealthy Western European countries have threatened to close their borders in response to waves of new arrivals from the Middle East and Africa. Poorer countries at Europe's periphery have struggled to cope with the number of people passing through in the hopes of claiming asylum in Western Europe.\nAmri was himself a newcomer to Europe, having left Tunisia after the country's 2011 revolution and taken an illegal boat across the Mediterranean to?Italy. He quickly ended up in the Italian prison system, where he was moved multiple times because of?problems with other inmates, the Associated Press reports . His family said that he tried and?failed to find work in Switzerland after his release ?.\nHe then headed to Germany last year and applied for asylum. Amri's?application was rejected, and he was the subject of a terror probe ?for his links to known extremists. However, moves to deport him were delayed because of his lack of a?passport. Some reports say he had used false identities ? at least six different names and three different nationalities ? in his travels around Europe.\nAmri was sought by German police after they discovered his identity documents in a wallet in the?truck that drove through Berlin's?Breitscheidplatz Christmas market. After he was killed, Italian authorities said on Friday that Amri had a train ticket to Milan that had left Chambery, France, the day before.?It remains unclear why he had traveled via France.\nDespite the criticism, the Schengen area remains important for the day-to-day lives of many people in Europe. One of them was the Polish driver who was found dead in the truck used by Amri to attack the Christmas market. The unnamed driver had been due to deliver steel to Berlin. Investigators are assuming he was taken hostage by the perpetrator of the attack ? and that, given signs of a struggle and the truck's erratic path, he may have?died while trying to stop it.\nMore on WorldViews\n	washingtonpost	World

He was the man nobody wanted.\nWhen Anis Amri washed up on European shores in a migrant boat in April?2011, he landed on the windswept Italian island of Lampedusa already a fugitive. Sought in his native Tunisia for hijacking a van with a gang of thieves, the frustrated Italians would jail him for arson and violent assault at his migrant reception center for minors on the isle of Sicily.\nThere, his family noted, the boy who once drank alcohol ? and never went to mosque ? suddenly got religion.\nHe began to pray, asking his family to send him religious books. The Italian Bureau of Prisons submitted a report to a government ?anti-terrorism commission on Amriâ€™s rapid radicalization, warning that he was embracing dangerous ideas of Islamist ?extremism and had threatened Christian inmates, according to an Italian government official with knowledge of the situation. The dossier was first reported by ANSA, the Italian news service.\nThe Italians tried to deport Amri but couldnâ€™t. They sent his fingerprints and photo to the Tunisian consulate, but the authorities there refused to recognize Amri as a citizen.

Reuters\nBuy Photo\nWait 1 second to continue.\nOn Monday, German authorities believe, Amri, now 24 and with previously known links to Islamist extremists, drove the truck that slammed into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12?and wounding dozens. They had tried to deport him, too, though Tunisia long refused to take him back.\nThe night before the attack, Amri called his family in Tunisia, as he would nearly every weekend. His birthday ? on Thursday ? was fast approaching, and he seemed animated.\nâ€œWhatâ€™s the weather like? Is it raining? What are you having for dinner?â€? his sister, Sayida Amri, 36, in his bleak home town of Oueslatia, Tunisia, recalled him asking Sunday. He asked her, she said, to pass the phone to his youngest niece, Zeinab ? 4?years old.\nâ€œDo you even know who I am?â€? he asked her.\n[ Refugees in Germany fear backlash after Berlin truck attack ]\nHis case suggests two critical realities of modern terrorism that present major new challenges, especially in Europe. The cumbersome, sometimes flawed system of deportation and asylum ? mixed with open borders ? has made it exceedingly easy for radicalized Islamists to operate on the continent.\nYet Amri is also the latest suspect to have emerged from a disconcerting counterterrorism gap in both Europe and the United States.\n45 years of terrorist attacks in Europe, visualized View Graphic\n45 years of terrorist attacks in Europe, visualized\nIn case after case ? including that of the German Christmas market attack ? authorities have come forward after the fact to say that they had enough cause to place the suspect under surveillance well before the violence. But never enough to move in for an arrest.\nThis has been true of the majority of lone-wolf terrorism plots over the past several years. The Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, had been under FBI investigation for 10?months.\nThe bureau had also tracked but had been unable to build a case against the Boston Marathon bombers or the plotters who targeted a contest to draw cartoons of the prophet Muhammad.\nThe same was true with Amri.\nSeveral months ago, during a surveillance operation monitoring radical Islamic preachers, German authorities intercepted a communication, which, in retrospect, appeared to forecast Amriâ€™s violent intent. They would not disclose the precise wording, but two German officials with knowledge of the investigation said the intercept was not straightforward enough to directly indicate an imminent threat.\nâ€œHe never made such a clear statement during this interaction, which could have led to the conclusion that he would become a martyr,â€? one of the officials said.\nAmri fell into a dangerous gray zone ? he was on the U.S. no-fly list a month ago, and Germans had linked him to a radical network led by Abu ?Walaa, a 32-year-old of Iraqi descent arrested in November on charges of recruiting and sending fighters from Germany to the Islamic State.\nAmri had also been under police surveillance for several months until September of this year, because he was suspected of planning a burglary in Berlin to finance the purchase of weapons. The suspicion wasnâ€™t confirmed, however, and authorities found him guilty only of being a small-time drug dealer.\nâ€œThis kind of super-low-tech, improvised thing is hard,â€? said Rafael Bossong, research associate at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. â€œThe guy didnâ€™t buy any weapons. He didnâ€™t give off absolutely clear signals. The question is, how do you definitely prevent that?â€?\n[ After Germany attack, Trump notes pledge to track American Muslims ]\nAmri appears to have attempted to manipulate the German asylum system ? an inundated bureaucracy clogged with a backlog of more than 400,000 cases following the arrival of 1.2?million asylum seekers over the course of the past two years.\nAccording to Der Spiegel, he claimed to be Egyptian and to have suffered persecution there when applying for asylum in Germany in April. When officials questioned him, he could not answer basic questions about his alleged home country. They checked their data system and found that he had been registered under several aliases and birthdays. By July, his asylum request was rejected.\nAnd yet, they could not deport him, because Tunisia initially refused to take him ? issuing him a passport only last Monday, the same day as the attack.\nThe way the system is designed, even had Amri fully cooperated, however, the Germans would not have had access to his criminal record in Italy. The computer databases used in Europe to vet migrants in the first instance does not include such data.\nEuropean law enforcement officials say that sharing information across borders has sharply increased in the 13?months since the Bataclan attack in Paris. But just because information is in a database does not always mean that it gets used, they say.\nâ€œIâ€™m not sure itâ€™s that we donâ€™t have enough information,â€? said Brian Donald, the chief of staff of Europol, the pan-European police agency. â€œI think itâ€™s more about ensuring that law enforcement has access to the information we have.â€?\nBack in Oueslatia, Amriâ€™s family remains incredulous. His brothers and sisters rushed back to their motherâ€™s home, a simple house on a dirt street, when they heard the news.\nThey said he changed after his arrest in Italy.\nâ€œHe started praying during his time in jail in Italy,â€? his sister said. â€œHe even asked me to send him a book called, â€˜Paradise for good people.â€™ â€?\nAfter his release, he told them he survived off small jobs ? painting, running errands.\nThe siblings huddled around a little charcoal burner, the sisters all hunched, arms wrapped tightly around them. They said they find it hard to believe that it was him, but if itâ€™s true, that he brought shame on his family and Tunisia.\nThey have been trying to contact him ever since they heard about him being wanted. His phone has been switched off.\nThey say he left for Italy in spring 2011, following a crime they say he was framed for. The arson in Italy, they insist, was also an accident.\nHis mother, Nour el Huda, 60, who at times had to leave the room to compose herself, described her youngest son as someone who used to drink alcohol and enjoyed Tunisian folk music. In jail in Sicily, according to the Italians, he spent time with a violent group of Tunisians and religious radicals.\nBut there was so much he didnâ€™t tell them ? including his attempt to claim asylum in Germany. After his release from the Italian jail, he got by, they said, by doing odd jobs. House painting. Running errands.\nâ€œMy son was planning to come back next year and start a small business here, said his mother, Nour el Huda, 60, her voice trembling. â€œHe was homesick.â€?\nâ€œWe hope he didnâ€™t do it; we really hope he wasnâ€™t involved,â€? she repeated as a German camera crew pulled up outside.\nKottoor reported from Oueslatia, Tunisia; Pitrelli, from Rome.

Reuters\nBy Anthony Faiola , Stephanie Kirchner and Souad Mekhennet December 21 Follow @Anthony_Faiola Follow stephi_says Follow @smekhennet\nBERLIN ? The prime suspect sought in the deadly attack on a Berlin Christmas market ? a 24-year-old Tunisian migrant ? was the subject of a terrorism probe in Germany earlier this year and was not deported even though his asylum bid was rejected, a senior German official said Wednesday.\nThe suspect ? who went by numerous aliases but was identified by German authorities as Anis Amri ? became the subject of a national manhunt after investigators discovered a wallet with his identity documents in the truck used in Mondayâ€™s attack that left 12 dead, two law enforcement officials told The Washington Post.?\nMeanwhile, a clearer portrait took shape of the suspect, including accusations that he had contact with a prominent Islamic State recruiter in Germany.\nGerman authorities issued a 100,000 euro ($105,000) reward for information leading to his capture, warning citizens not to approach the 5-foot-8, 165-pound Amri, whom they described as â€œviolent and armed.â€?\nHis record, however, further deepened the political fallout from Mondayâ€™s bloodshed ? pointing to flaws in the German deportation system and putting a harsh light on Chancellor Angela Merkelâ€™s humanitarian bid to open the nationâ€™s doors to nearly 1?million asylum seekers last year.\n(Victoria Walker,Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\nAlthough the vast majority of those who flooded into Europe were on the move to escape war and unrest, dozens of terrorism suspects have slipped into Germany and neighboring nations posing as migrants. Amri, officials said, was not part of the surge of migrants who entered Europe via the onetime main route from Turkey and Greece ? a path that has been now largely cut off.\nRather, he came to Germany last year via Italy, where he apparently had entered as early as 2012. He applied for German asylum but was rejected in June and later faced deportation.\nAmri was the subject of a terrorism probe on suspicion of â€œpreparing a serious act of violent subversion,â€? and he had known links to Islamist extremists, authorities said.\nWhy a failed asylum seeker with such links and no passport was walking German streets is â€œthe question 82 million Germans probably want an answer to,â€? said Rainer Wendt, Chairman of the German Police Union.\nHe added: â€œHow many more ticking time bombs are roaming around here? . . . We saw how much damage one person can do with a truck.â€?\n[ Gallery: Festive corner of Berlin now a sad memorial ]\nThe dragnet for the suspect appeared to initially focus on the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as Berlin, both places where the Tunisian suspect once lived. Police units had been due to stage raids Wednesday, officials said, but they remained mysteriously on hold.\n45 years of terrorist attacks in Europe, visualized View Graphic\n45 years of terrorist attacks in Europe, visualized\nThe interior minister in North Rhine-Westphalia, Ralf J?ger, said the Tunisian man had bounced around Germany since arriving in July 2015, living in the southern city of Freiburg and later in Berlin.?\nAlthough authorities have sought to accelerate the deportation of rejected asylum seekers this year, there is still a backlog in Germany of tens of thousands, many of whom are able to resist because their countries of origin refuse to take them back. Amri, J?ger said, was one of them.?\nAmri had not been deported because ? like many asylum seekers in Germany ? he did not have a passport. The Tunisian government, J?ger explained, initially denied that he was a national and delayed issuing his passport. Pending his deportation, Amri had received a â€œtolerationâ€? status from the government.?\nAmriâ€™s new Tunisian passport, J?ger?said, finally arrived Wednesday.\nâ€œI donâ€™t want to comment further on that circumstance,â€? said a visibly angered J?ger.\n[ Berlin attack: How the events unfolded ]\nImportantly, authorities knew that Amri had â€œinteractedâ€? with Abu Walaa, a 32-year-old of Iraqi descent arrested in November on charges of recruiting and sending fighters from Germany to the Islamic State. Key evidence in Walaaâ€™s case came from an Islamic State defector who had returned to Germany and accused Walaa of helping to recruit him and arrange his travel to Syria.\nâ€œAnis Amri was engaging with extremist salafist circles in Germany,â€? a German security official said.\nAccording to Karen MÃ¼ller, spokeswoman for the Berlin prosecutor, Amri had also been under police surveillance for several months until September of this year, because he was suspected of planning a burglary in Berlin to finance the purchase of ?weapons. The suspicion wasnâ€™t confirmed. He was, she said, found only to be a small-time drug dealer.\nThe leaking of the suspectâ€™s name and photograph in the press, authorities said, may have upset attempts to find him. Germanyâ€™s interior minister, Thomas de MaiziÃ¨re, would tell reporters in Berlin only that Germany had registered â€œa suspectâ€? as wanted on European databases. He refused to give further details.\nThe two German law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive case, said investigators discovered the manâ€™s documents in the cabin of the truck that barreled into the market.\nIt remained unclear whether authorities believe the Tunisian man drove the truck, but police nevertheless made tracking him a priority.\nRevelation of the asylum seekerâ€™s background sparked outrage among conservative politicians and seemed set to damage Merkel, who is running for reelection next year.\nâ€œThere is a connection between the refugee crisis and the heightened terror threat in Germany,â€? said Stefan Mayer, parliamentary spokesman on domestic affairs for the Christian Social Union party. â€œThis can also be seen in the case of this Tunisian.â€?\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to stand by his plans to establish a registry for Muslims and temporarily ban Muslim immigrants from the United States.\nSpeaking outside his Mar-a-\nLago resort in Florida, Trump did not walk back the proposals after he was asked by a reporter whether he was rethinking or reevaluating them in the wake of a fresh terrorist attack in Berlin.\nâ€œYou know my plans,â€? Trump said.\nHe went on to add that the attack on a Berlin Christmas market, which was claimed by the Islamic State, had vindicated him.\nâ€œAll along, Iâ€™ve been proven to be right. One hundred percent correct,â€? Trump said. â€œWhatâ€™s happening is disgraceful.â€?\n[Whatâ€™s known so far about the Berlin investigation ]\nGermanyâ€™s Bild newspaper said Amri had several aliases and was apparently born in the southern Tunisian desert town of Tataouine in 1992.\nWitnesses described one man fleeing the scene after the truck ? packed with a cargo of steel ? roared into revelers at a traditional Christmas market. One suspect, a Pakistani asylum seeker, was arrested Monday night, but authorities later released him because of a lack of evidence.\nThe new information emerged as German investigators raced for clues in the hunt for Amri and other possible suspects in the assault. They pored over forensic evidence and GPS data as they sought to retrace the steps of the runaway attacker. They were re-questioning witnesses and analyzing DNA traces found in the truck, as well as on the body of a dead Polish man in the passenger seat.?\nThe Pole worked for a trucking company and was delivering a payload of steel to Berlin. Investigators are going on the assumption that he was taken hostage by the assailant ? and may even have died a hero. J?rg Radek, deputy chairman of the German Trade Union of the Police, said evidence suggested that â€œa fight took place in the driverâ€™s cabin.â€? As it barreled toward the crowded market, the truck was not driving straight, but â€œin a zigzag line,â€? he noted.\n[ After Berlin, security tightens at Christmas markets ]?\nThe Islamic State on Tuesday claimed responsibility for inspiring the unknown attacker ? a claim as yet unproven and possibly just opportunistic. But it prompted some politicians to quickly point the finger at Merkelâ€™s refu?gee policy, even as others pushed back, calling the accusations a politicizing of tragedy that had no place in progressive Germany.?\nThere were also growing calls for the deployment of more police on the streets with military-style weapons ? an unusual move in pacifist Germany. At the normally quaint and picturesque Christmas markets in at least three German cities ? Mainz, Magdeburg and Dresden ? concrete barriers were quickly erected to add security.
 In Magdeburg, police officers armed with automatic weapons were guarding the entrance.\nYet others argued that living in a free society was perhaps more important and that Germans were willing to accept a certain measure of risk to preserve that openness.?\nâ€œIf we want to maintain the freedom of our society, we simply have to live with the risk contained in this decision,â€? Die Tageszeitung said in a Wednesday editorial.\nDan Eggen in Washington contributed to this report.\nRead more?????????\n	washingtonpost	World

Italian police officers stand next to the body of Anis Amri, the suspect in the Berlin truck attack, in a suburb of Milan. Reuters\nWait 1 second to continue.\nThe second patrolman ? trainee Luca ScatÃ , now an instant national hero ? fired back, killing the suspect.\nThe shootout would end the violent arc of Amriâ€™s life, marking another salvo in a relentless new wave of Islamist terrorism in Europe that has vexed the ability of nations to thwart it. German authorities say they believe that the Tunisian national is the same man who hijacked a truck with a payload of steel on Monday, shot its Polish driver and then rammed it into a Berlin Christmas market.\nâ€œHe was the most-wanted man in Europe,â€? said Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti.\n[ Refugees in Germany fear backlash after Berlin truck attack ]\nThe market attack has sparked an outcry for sweeping reforms and bolstered security while raising serious questions about German police and intelligence ?lapses as well as Europeâ€™s handling of criminal migrants. As a result, in a country that cherishes personal privacy, new laws are being pushed in Germany that could ramp up surveillance and extend judicial powers.\nChancellor Angela Merkel thanked Italian authorities Friday while adding that â€œthe Amri case raises a number of questions. . . . We will now press ahead and look into how far state measures need to be changed.â€?\nHours after the shootout, the Islamic Stateâ€™s Amaq news agency released a video of Amri that was tauntingly filmed only 1.5 miles from the German Chancellery in Berlin. He seemed calm, yet certain in a black-hooded windbreaker on an iron bridge as he called on Muslims in Europe to rise up and strike at â€œcrusaders.â€?\nâ€œGod willing, we will slaughter you like pigs,â€? he said in the video, whose date and location was not given but looked as if it was filmed under wintry skies.\nHe added: â€œTo my brothers everywhere, fight for the sake of Allah. Protect our religion. Everyone can do this in their own way. People who can fight should fight, even in Europe.â€?\nThe authenticity of the video could not be independently confirmed, but previous material released by Amaq has been credible. Earlier, a statement carried on Amaq described Amri as inspired by the Islamic State.\nIn Oueslatia, Amriâ€™s bleak home town in Tunisia, news of his death had reached his mother, five sisters and three brothers, who until the end held hopes that the German authorities were after the wrong guy.\nHis 30-year-old brother, Walid Amri, sounded distressed and was struggling to speak over the phone. Women were wailing in the background.\nâ€œThis is a very difficult time for the entire family,â€? he said, before his voice broke.\nWhile Anis Amriâ€™s death ended the hunt for the suspect who drove a truck into a teeming Christmas market on Monday, killing 12 and wounding dozens, it also suggested the security risks inherent to Europeâ€™s open borders as well as structural flaws with its deportation and migrant systems.\n[ Amid rising German fears, experts warn of â€˜underage terroristsâ€™ ]\nIn Germany, Federal Attorney General Peter Frank said fingerprints confirmed that Amri was the man killed. But German and European authorities grappled with how Amri ? who Italian authorities say traveled at least part of the way by train through France ? managed to slip out of Berlin and make it to Milan almost three days after he was identified as the prime suspect.\nHis death in Italy put a harsh light on the handling of the case. German investigators only uncovered their single-biggest clue ? his wallet with identification left in the truckâ€™s cabin ? the day after the attack, suggesting the delay may have facilitated his flight.\nAmri then traveled right under the noses of European authorities through a circuitous route.\nAfter leaving Berlin, Amri is believed to have traveled, at least part way by train, through the French city of Chambery. Speeding through the Alps, he appears to have stopped in Turin, Italy, before arriving in Milan, said Alberto Nobili, coordinator of the anti-terrorism department at the district attorneyâ€™s office in Milan. Milan police say they have surveillance video placing Amri at Milanâ€™s train station about 1?a.m.\nâ€œWe need to increase international collaboration against terrorism,â€? Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni told reporters in Rome.\nGerman officials said their investigation would now accelerate toward possible accomplices.\nâ€œIf there are others who are guilty or accomplices, we will hold them accountable,â€? Merkel said.\nAmri ? a fugitive in his native Tunisia for a van hijacking ? arrived in Italy by boat in April 2011. He was dangerously radicalized while serving time in Sicily for arson and assault. His family noted that the boy they knew ? who once drank alcohol and never went to mosque ? suddenly got religion.\nHe began to pray, asking his family to send him religious books. The Italian Bureau of Prisons submitted a report to a government anti-terrorism commission on Amriâ€™s rapid radicalization, warning that he was embracing dangerous ideas of Islamist extremism and had threatened Christian inmates, according to an Italian government official with knowledge of the situation. The dossier was first reported by ANSA, the state-run Italian news service.\nThe Tunisians, however, would not take Amri back. So the Italians simply released him in 2014.\nHe made his way to Germany a year later and would apply for asylum. Rejected, the Germans could not deport him, either, because he had no passport and the Tunisians refused his repatriation for months.\nThe Germans had linked him to a German-based recruiter for the Islamic State, and Amri was the subject of a terrorism probe. He once tried to buy a gun on the Internet. Officials intercepted a communication between Amri and hate preachers that in retrospect appeared to foreshadow his assault.\nBut officials felt they never had enough evidence to detain him.\nIn Germany, the case was already having serious repercussions. Earlier this week, the German government passed a draft law ? albeit one in the works before Mondayâ€™s attack ? that would allow improved video surveillance in public spaces, such as train stations and shopping centers. Interior Minister Thomas de MaiziÃ¨re is also seeking to accelerate approval of an existing plan that would make it possible to detain rejected asylum seekers who constitute a â€œdanger to public safety.â€?\nThe Germans are especially seeking to deport North Africans with rejected asylum claims and whose countries of origin have refused to take them back. Many of those nations ? especially Tunisia ? are themselves facing a serious radicalization problem, with thousands of their nationals rushing to join the Islamic State.\nMerkel said Wednesday that she had earlier spoken on the phone with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi.\nâ€œI told the president that we have to significantly speed up the return process and continue to increase the number of returnees.â€? she said. â€œWe can be relieved at the end of this week that an acute danger has ended. The general threat of terrorism, however, continues to exist, as it has for many years.â€?\nPitrelli reported from Rome.

Eighty-one are delegates from the 27 congressional districts and 14 are at-large and automatic delegates.\nThree delegates are up for grabs in each congressional district, despite differences in the number of voters, party allegiance or geographic area.\nThough all districts have similar populations, counts of active Republican voters can vary dramatically. Districts in New York City have the fewest Republican voters.\nThat means a single Republican vote has higher value in those districts because they have fewer Republican voters overall.\nTrump is leading the polls in New York with 53 percent support.\nIf he actually wins 53 percent, under the rules, he would get the 14 at-large and automatic delegates.\nIf he were to win 53 percent in each congressional district, Trump could sweep the state. That's unlikely to happen.\nIn each district, there are two thresholds for winning delegates.\nIf two or more candidates get more than 20 percent of the vote, first place wins two delegates and runner-up wins one.\nSo if Trump wins with less than 50 percent of the vote, he???d get two delegates instead of three.\nAt this point, Trump needs 66.1 percent of the remaining bound delegates to clinch the nomination.\nTrump's competitors are focusing on the areas where they have the best chance to win the most delegates with the fewest number of voters.\nThat's why the heavily Democratic districts in New York City have the most power to hinder or help Trump.\nSources\nFrontloadingHQ, the Green Paper, AP, Post research and staff reports\nShare this story\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Photo by Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\nSo what does Bernie Sanders want?\nLast night, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said the campaign wanted to go on a superdelegate hunt deep into the summer. On the other hand, senior adviser Tad Devine was saying they?wanted to see how the Acela primary results shook out, then "assess where we are." And the candidate himself just wanted to?go home,?making a?late journey back to Vermont that caught his traveling press corps by surprise.\nThe long-term answer to the question of what Bernie Sanders wants "will have a direct bearing on how united Democrats will be heading into the fall campaign ? and whether Sanders will be able to leverage his success this year into lasting power and influence," note Dan Balz and John Wagner.\n"His campaign for the Democratic nomination has been more successful than almost anyone had predicted. ...?But as Clinton extends her lead in pledged delegates, Sanders must now confront the reality that he has almost no chance of becoming the Democratic nominee. Instead he must decide what he will do with what he has built ? starting with how he conducts his campaign over the next two months, how he navigates the partyâ€™s national convention in July, what role he plays in the general election and, perhaps most importantly, what happens after the November results have been tallied.\n"...What Sanders decides about the future course of his campaign could be crucial to how quickly the party comes together after what has become an increasingly fractious nominating battle, something the Clinton forces are keenly aware of. Sandersâ€™s recent attacks on Clinton have alarmed her supporters. They are now listening closely for a change in his rhetoric ? as there was in Clintonâ€™s at roughly the same point in 2008 in her contest against then-Sen. Barack Obama.\nFor now, his team "showed no immediate signs of relenting in its improbable bid to catch her in the chase for delegates."\n. (Photo by Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\nOver the past few weeks, that chase has changed course.?"[Jeff] Weaver knows very well that he's not going to catch Clinton's pledged delegates,"? says ?Philip Bump. "His only hope has been to convince superdelegates that Sanders has momentum or that he will win the popular vote or that Sanders is preferred nationally or that he's got the better shot in November. Sanders supporters loathe the superdelegates, who they fairly see as undemocratic. But the campaign had no choice.\n"On Tuesday night, Weaver admitted that -- and tacitly admitted that several of the arguments he'd want to use to convince superdelegates have stumbled. The overwrought 'momentum'?argument, predicated on a cluster of demographically friendly states, was crippled by Clinton's better-than-expected New York win -- which also hurt the popular vote argument. Weaver has very few arrows left in his quiver."\nBernie Sanders has so far won every county named Clinton County pic.twitter.com/CdNVdd9fwU\n? Ariel Edwards-Levy (@aedwardslevy) April 20, 2016\nTHE NEXT STOP:\n. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson)\nDonald Trump?and Hillary Clinton are looking to?ride?to victory in the Acela primary?next Tuesday.?\nBoth front-runners?"plunged swiftly Wednesday into the next batch of primaries in five states along the Northeast Corridor, where they hope to bury or break their challengers for the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations," report Sean Sullivan and Anne Gearan.\n"Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island will vote next Tuesday in what many are dubbing the 'Acela primary,'?putting Clinton and Trump on terrain well-tailored to their campaigns. For Clinton, itâ€™s a chance to effectively end Vermont Sen. Bernie Sandersâ€™s long-shot hopes in the Democratic race.\n"For Trump, the contests are an opportunity to further pad his delegate lead over Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and send him tumbling into the final six weeks of the campaign. That crucial period will determine whether the mogul will clinch the GOP nomination outright or if the race will head to a contested convention."\n(If you're the sort of person who isn't keen on the "Acela?primary" coinage, a PSA: today, Ted Cruz called the California primary "The Big Enchilada." If you have any alternatives in mind, the time to speak up?is now.)\nCruz's dlgte slate in PA: Consists of 24 names for 54 slots. Cmpgn says others (not on slate) have verbally pledged. pic.twitter.com/WSkg9cNJ2T\n? Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) April 20, 2016\nIn Pennsylvania, the Cruz campaign is once again looking to gain ground during the delegate selection process,?as the Trump campaign's new convention guru Paul Manafort predicts ?this time will be different:?"We were involved in the filing, and weâ€™re going to run a very competitive race."\nThe latest Trump team #math: the mogul?"will accumulate more than 1,400 delegates to secure the nomination on the first round of balloting at the party's Cleveland convention, according to an internal campaign memorandum," reports Philip Rucker. [Note: Here's that memo in its entirety, fabulously annotated by Chris Cillizza.]\n"The projections come in a memo distributed to Trump surrogates late Tuesday night containing talking points for use in media interviews this week. The memo, obtained by The Washington Post, describes Trump's commanding win in the New York primary as 'YUGE'?and encourages his supporters to speak out about what Trump has described as a 'rigged'?process of selecting delegates for the Republican National Convention in July.\n"The memo refers to the campaign's staff shakeup, with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski's power diminished and newly-hired adviser Paul Manafort assuming broad control over the campaign's strategy and its enhanced budget. It reads, 'Building out our campaign staff to make sure we leave no stone unturned and that we can win this thing on the up and up ? not through a rigged set of rules.'"\nThe most?interesting thing about the memo wasn't?necessarily what the campaign had to say. It's how they said it. "The 1,165-word memo was distributed via e-mail to a blind list of surrogates and other supporters by Trump aide Erica Freeman. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks as well as Rick Gates, a Manafort deputy, were copied on the message. The campaign has been sending similar memos almost daily for the past couple of weeks, another sign that the operation is maturing into a more traditional political operation under Manafort's leadership."\nThat's the Trump #math. Here's ours : the front-runner needs to win roughly 63 percent of the remaining delegates in order to claim a delegate majority ahead of the convention. And that sounds like a tall order,?particularly when you look at his showings to date:\nBut at this point in the primary?season, past performance isn't necessarily an indicator of future results. "Many of the remaining Republican contests are winner-take-all or winner-take-most (as was New York)," notes Bump.?"Meaning that Trump has a much better shot at outperforming his target of 63 percent. In most states, his delegate haul has outperformed his actual vote percentage by a decent margin."\n(To?reach that?1,400 mark before Cleveland, he'd have to win more than 80?percent of the remaining delegates.)\nAt this moment, Bernie Sanders would need?to win a smaller proportion of the remaining pledged?Democratic delegates --?roughly 59 percent?-- to reach Philadelphia with a majority. The fact that he?doesn't have the?winner-take-all option is a big reason it?is virtually impossible for him to catch up to Hillary Clinton. (Then again, any sort of?winner-take-all or -most option?would have only amplified Clinton's big win last night.)\nTHE VIEW FROM THE FIELD:\nBeing handed out at Trump's rally in Indianapolis: pic.twitter.com/gHxco038bw\n?

Bernie Sanders walks to the stage during a rally at Penn State University on Tuesday. (Photo by Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\nIt's not just Bernie Sanders's fundraising that is staggering. The senator from Vermont managed to spend roughly $46 million in March alone, the same amount he raised, based on figures released by his campaign Wednesday night.\nThat means Sanders's spending in one?month was equal to?more than one-third of the $122.6 million his campaign had spent in its entirety?through February.\nDetails of the campaign's spending, which were due to be reported to the Federal Election Commission by midnight, were not yet?available. But the huge outlays came as Sanders was challenging Clinton on various fronts, scoring victories in Colorado, Minnesota and Oklahoma.\nFor her part, Clinton spent $32.3 million in March while raising $29.3 million. She still ended the month with more money in the bank than her rival: $29 million to his $17 million, according to figures released by the campaigns.\nSanders's online fundraising machine beat Clinton for the third month in a row, and he is close to outraising her for the entire election cycle: he brought in $185.5 million through the end of March from 2.2 million donors, while she collected $191 million from more than 1.1 million contributors.\nBut Clinton is also flanked by a network of well-funded independent allies. The biggest, the super PAC Priorities USA Action, has amassed $67.2 million so far, including $11.8 million in March.\nPriorities' largest?donor last month was hedge fund manager?James Simons, who gave $3.5 million -- doubling his previous?$3.5 million?contribution. S. Donald Sussman, another wealthy hedge fund manager, donated?$1.5 million, bringing his total contributions to the group to $4 million.\nOther million-dollar donors in March were already on The Washington Post's list of top 50 super PAC contributors , including Univision Chairman Haim Saban and his wife Cheryl (who gave $2 million) and Mary Kathryn and Jay Pritzker (who contributed $1.8 million).\nMatea Gold is a national political reporter for The Washington Post, covering money and influence.\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Republican presidential candidate?Ted Cruz cast?rival Donald Trump as a coward and a "niche candidate," asserting here Wednesday that the front-runner?cannot win a majority of delegates before the nominating?convention and challenging Trump?to a debate before next Tuesday's East Coast primaries.\nWith Trump buoyed by a big?victory in Tuesday's New York primary, Cruz is seeking an advantage by challenging the billionaire mogul to a debate?before five states ? Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island ? vote next week.\n"Donald Trump is unwilling to stand on stage and debate because he cannot defend his positions or his policies," Cruz charged at a Wednesday afternoon news conference here.\nThe Republican candidates held their last debate in early March in Florida. Cruz noted?that the two Democratic candidates, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, held a debate last week in New York and are in talks to schedule another soon. He?asked reporters, "What does it say [that]?Hillary Clinton, the embodiment of imperial Washington arrogance, is more willing to submit to the voters and appear in a debate than Donald Trump?"\nCruz made his comments during a visit to the Republican National Committee meeting here in Florida, where he and his top campaign advisers spent the day meeting privately?with RNC members to lay out their strategies and try to persuade them to support his candidacy at?an open convention.\nCruz acknowledged his defeat to Trump in New York, the real estate developer's home state, but said when the contest heads westward, starting with the Indiana primary May 3, he will regain momentum.\n"At?the end of the day, to earn the Republican nomination, you have to earn the support of a majority of the delegates elected by the people," Cruz said. "We are on a path to doing that and Donald is on a path to losing the nomination. And all of his bluster and all of his bravado is designed to hide that simple fact."\nCruz argued that it is mathematically unlikely if not impossible for Trump to reach the delegate threshold of 1,237 to secure the nomination before the end of voting June 7. He said Trump is too much of a "niche candidate" to win broad enough?support across?the Republican Party to secure the nomination.\n"What is clear today is that we are headed to a contested convention," Cruz said. "Nobody is able to reach 1,237. Iâ€™m not going to reach 1,237 and Donald Trump is not going to reach 1,237."\nIn his news conference, which lasted 21 minutes, Cruz showed flashes of frustration with the news media for, in his view, overhyping Trump's win in New York. He also grew hot talking about Ohio Gov. John Kasich, whose continued presence in the race Cruz?acknowledged was hurting his ability to amass more delegates.\nâ€œJohn Kasich is an honorable and decent man whose only role in this election is as a spoiler," Cruz said.\nCruz added, "He has lost now, I think itâ€™s 31 states. Heâ€™s won a total of one, his home state. His plan apparently rests upon losing?49 states, going to the convention and having all the delegates say the guy who lost every state in the union except his home state ought to be our nominee. Thatâ€™s simply not going to happen.â€?\nCruz went so far as to suggest that Kasich was only staying in the race as a favor to Trump. "It may be that John is auditioning to be Donald Trump's vice president," Cruz said.\nKasich repeatedly has denied any interest in serving on a ticket with Trump. Despite running a distant third in the delegate count, Kasich has been attracting support from the party's establishment and moderate wings. He?is banking on a contested convention, where he would press his case to delegates in successive rounds of balloting that of the three Republican candidates, he?alone could defeat the Democrats in the general election and win the White House.\nPhilip Rucker is a national political correspondent for The Washington Post, where he has reported since 2005.\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(AP)\nBERLIN, Md. ? Fresh from a commanding victory in the New York Republican primary, Donald Trump on Wednesday homed in on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, saying he looks forward to facing the former secretary of state and knocking her for unspecified wrongdoings.\nâ€œYou know, we are going to beat crooked Hillary," he said smiling. "Crooked Hillary Clinton does not have a chance. She's not bringing jobs back. She doesn't know about the economy. She makes bad decisions. You know what Bernie Sanders said about her twice, you know that. Number one, he said, she wasnâ€™t qualified ... but he said bad judgment, she's got bad judgment."\nâ€œIt is going to be something that you're going to watch and really enjoy watching,â€? Trump said in another instance, which drew cheers from the crowd of 1,500 at the rally.\nTrump has regularly attacked Clinton for using a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, which he says compromised national security. He said Wednesday that he believes she is being â€œprotected,â€? though he did not specify by whom, and added that he would consider investigating her â€œa second timeâ€? if elected president.\nBoth Clinton and Trump ??increasingly poised to face one another in the general election ??have escalated their direct critiques of one another in recent days. Trump regularly knocks Clinton on the trail and recently?gave?her the moniker, â€œCrooked Hillary,â€? which he has repeated continually in recent days. He?said that many people have â€œsuffered dearly for doing just a small fraction of what she did.â€?\nâ€œFrankly, she should not be allowed to run for president. What sheâ€™s done is terrible,â€? he told a crowd here in Berlin, Md., where voters will cast ballots Tuesday. â€œ[I]n a certain way I am happy about it, because we are going to beat her so bad.â€?\nBut Trump still has a primary on his hands, and he has continually railed against members of the GOP establishment who are uncomfortable with him becoming the partyâ€™s standard-bearer. Anti-Trump conservatives hope to deny Trump the nomination through a contested convention?in July, which would rest on preventing Trump from earning the 1,237 national delegates necessary to clinch the nomination outright.\nThe billionaire has called the process â€œriggedâ€? and â€œfixed,â€? while his detractors say the delegate system has?been in place for generations. Trump has specifically targeted the Republican National Committee ??which remains publicly neutral in the primary ??for not moving to?change the system.\nTrump has reshuffled his campaign staff in recent weeks, enlisting the help of veteran political strategists and installing longtime GOP strategist Paul Manafort as "convention manager," empowering him with many of the responsibilities previously assigned to campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\nThe campaign is?bullish that Trump will be able to win the nomination directly, and?the billionaire and his team were?encouraged by the victory in New York. An internal memorandum circulated to campaign surrogates Tuesday night shows that they hope to win as many as 1,400 pledged delegates at the GOP?convention in Cleveland in July.\nJose A.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\nOn Tuesday night, Donald Trump won 26 of New York's 27 congressional districts, most of them by getting a majority of the votes. It was enough to earn him nearly all of the state's 95 delegates, a big step forward toward his goal of hitting 1,237 pledged delegates before the Republican convention.\nNew York is Trump's home state, although the one congressional district he lost was the one in which he lives and the only county he lost in the state was Manhattan's. He won the rest of the congressional districts, including the 15th, up in The Bronx.\nWhy's that worth mentioning? Because New York's 15th congressional district has the distinct honor of giving Trump three delegates for the stunningly low price of 214 votes each. In total, according to the most recent numbers, 1,022 Republicans in that district voted, 642 of them for Trump.\nThat was by far the fewest votes it took to elect any of Trump's congressional district delegates -- but those delegates count just as much as any of the others that will be casting ballots in Cleveland. Trump's cheapest delegates (in terms of votes required) were in four districts in New York, including the 7th, 9th and 13th. His 11 cheapest delegate hauls were in New York and Hawaii.\nWhy? Because New York (and Hawaii) are heavily Democratic states that apportion delegates by congressional district. There simply aren't that many Republicans in New York's 15th, as the Monkey Cage noted on Tuesday. But they still got three delegates to hand out under the Republican rules. And so here we are.\nTed Cruz was a little annoyed about this. He mocked Trump's whining about the outcomes in Colorado (where Cruz out-maneuvered Trump to scoop up all of the delegates) during an event on Wednesday.\n. @TedCruz : "You don't hear me up here complaining and whining" that New Yorkers have their votes count twice as much as Texans' do.\n? Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) April 20, 2016\nTwice? Try again. If we compare Trump's most expensive delegate, which came from the 4th district in Texas, to his cheapest from the Bronx, it's a bit more than twice.\nTrump voters in New York's 15th were 180 times as powerful as those in Texas's 4th. Seven of Trump's nine most expensive delegates came in Texas. The other two were in Georgia and Oklahoma. Why? Because those places are very Republican.\nCruz's patterns were similar, by the way. His cheapest was in Hawaii, too -- but it cost him 2,002 votes. His most expensive was in Mississippi, at nearly 47,000 votes.\nIt's not really news that the delegate allocation process isn't completely fair, any more than it's news that the Electoral College or the Senate weight certain states more than others. But the scale of the disparity is still pretty staggering.\nAll congressional votes and delegate counts from The Green Papers .

Heâ€™s a tax-cutting, budget-balancing conservative with 18 years in Congress under his belt, plus a term-and-a-half leading the nationâ€™s seventh-largest state. Kasichâ€™s state has 18 electoral votes, which Republicans need in November; he is popular there, with a 62?percent approval rating.\nCharles Lane is a Post editorial writer, specializing in economic policy, federal fiscal issues and business, and a contributor to the PostPartisan blog. View Archive\nWhatâ€™s more, in 15 head-to-head polls during 2016, he beat Hillary Clinton every time, by the margin of error or greater, according to RealClearPolitics. Both Donald Trump and Sen.?Ted Cruz?(R-Tex.) consistently trail the Democrat.\nFamiliar, conservative, electable: Whatâ€™s not to like? Yes, yes ? heâ€™s a rambling orator, at best, and notoriously peevish. But having met Kasich and listened to him talk about the issues with The Postâ€™s editorial board for more than an hour Wednesday, Iâ€™ve got a hypothesis about why heâ€™s failed ? and it has nothing to do with his quirks, which were mostly under control during our session.\nKasichâ€™s problem is that heâ€™s not apocalyptic.\nRepublican presidential candidate John Kasich talks to The Washington Post about the race to win delegates, Donald Trump and race relations in the U.S. (The Washington Post)\nU.S. unemployment and economic growth are better than in most industrial countries; international security is dicey but contained. For GOP primary voters, though, itâ€™s axiomatic that President Obamaâ€™s America is going to hell in a handcart. More than 80?percent of them told a Rand Corp. survey in December that the country is â€œoff on the wrong track.â€?\nThat number barely scratches the surface of GOP discontent. In March, the Pew Research Center found that 66?percent of the party rank-and-file believe life is â€œworseâ€? for people like them than it was a half-century ago. Some 64 percent feel it will be even worse for the next generation. In both respects, GOP negativity was greater by double-digit margins than that of the general public.\nTo this epic angst, Kasich responds with a message thatâ€™s not so much sunny as it is conventional: â€œI get that. But my idea is we can fix it ? these things can be fixed. And I think weâ€™ve overdramatized our situation. Iâ€™m not being coldhearted here, but weâ€™ve had worse times in this country ? far worse times in this country. Weâ€™ll be fine.â€?\nHe touted his record in Ohio, his policy proposals, the â€œspiritâ€? of ordinary folks. He forgot to hate the mainstream media, praising the â€œresponsibleâ€? role of The Post and other major dailies ? even lauding the New Yorker, whose subscriber list is not in high demand with GOP fundraisers.\nThese are the sorts of things you say when you think itâ€™s still important to curry favor with editorial boards, and that voting is still an instrumental exercise ? a choice about the best person to entrust with the Oval Office for four years.\nAlas for Kasich, Republicans this year seem to be voting as a form of expressive conduct ? a statement about who they are, how they feel and, above all, whoâ€™s to blame for their grievances.\nWhat arouses people ? what makes them feel validated ? are Trumpâ€™s complaints that â€œwe donâ€™t win anymore,â€? and, to a lesser degree, Cruzâ€™s promises to pull us â€œback from the abyss,â€? as he put it in January.\nSomething similar is happening with Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side ? but in his case the scapegoat is Wall Street rather than the Muslims or undocumented immigrants who populate the demonologies of Trump and Cruz.\nKasich, to his credit, has refused to match their ugliest rhetoric ? one reason, possibly, that he polls well with the more moderate November electorate.\nYet this has not helped him with overwhelmingly white doom-and-gloom GOP voters ? 56?percent of whom told Pew that immigrants â€œburdenâ€? the country, and only 46?percent of whom said increasing racial and ethnic diversity makes America â€œa better place,â€? in contrast with 71?percent of Democrats.\nIn March, Rand re-surveyed the same people it polled in December; those GOP voters who thought the country was on the wrong track in the first poll were 40?percent less likely to support Kasich than Trump or Cruz, according to researcher Michael Pollard. Republican voters who thought the economy was getting worse were 45?percent less likely to support Kasich.\nThis, even though GOP voters identified Kasich as the candidate closest to them on the ideological spectrum: The Ohio governor scored right at the partyâ€™s midpoint, Trump well to the left of it and Cruz to the right.\nAt various times in our interview, Kasich faulted his opponentsâ€™ negativity, accusing them, a bit inelegantly, of driving the people â€œinto the ditch.â€?\nHe flatters the voters. â€œInto the ditchâ€? is the course they have chosen, and if an electoral apocalypse awaits Republicans in November, it will be of their own making.\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

But in an era when â€œbrandâ€? is both a noun and a verb and when â€œcuratingâ€? is the thing to do, why should it surprise us that the New Trump took less than two weeks to fabricate?\nAfter the wild, undisciplined and offensive period leading up to his April?5 loss in the Wisconsin primary to Ted Cruz, Trump decided he needed to curate his brand big time.\nShoved aside were key staffers, including his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , who had reveled in the, shall we say, forceful approach to politics that was supposed to be part of Trumpâ€™s authenticity. Trump is trying to banish offensive talk about women, the gratuitous fights with television anchors, the uninformed comments about abortion.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has hired more experienced political operatives and shuffled his top staffers as talk of a contested convention grows. One of his top staffers, national field director Stuart Jolly, resigned amid the changes. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\nTrump is going as establishment as he can. Heâ€™s even forgoing opportunities to hawk his product line, including Trump-blessed slabs of red meat, on primary nights. He bizarrely indulged in this in early March after his victories in Michigan and Mississippi.\nTrumpâ€™s restrained victory speech Tuesday night after his New York primary blowout led Bloomberg Newsâ€™s John Heilemann to offer an eloquent three-word obituary on â€œMorning Joeâ€? for the Old Trump: â€œNo Steaks Sold.â€?\nBut any doubts about The Donald deciding that being himself is overrated are erased by a visit to what has been sacred Trumpian space, his Twitter account. Consider this message that crossed my screen at 8:42?a.m. Wednesday: â€œTed Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!â€?\nWhatâ€™s shockingly extraordinary about this was how thoroughly ordinary it was. â€œMathematicallyâ€? is not an adverb we are accustomed to seeing from @realDonaldTrump. The Trump Showâ€™s recurring villain, Lyinâ€™ Ted, was gone, replaced by a boring guy named Ted Cruz.\nSo jarring was this cast change to many of the 7.7?million of us who faithfully follow Trumpâ€™s Twitter drama that Sarah Huckabee Sanders, senior campaign adviser, appeared on CNNâ€™s â€œNew Dayâ€? to offer comforting words. â€œI wouldnâ€™t be too sure to erase that,â€? she said of â€œLyinâ€™ Ted,â€? using language suggesting that Trump is trying to â€œeraseâ€? a lot of other things. She added: â€œMy guess is itâ€™ll still pop up from time to time.â€? Happy day.\nHer efforts to reassure the fans may have been the most significant post-New York pronouncement from Team Trump, which has simultaneously created a long-running, highly rated TV show ? it might be called â€œCelebrity Candidateâ€? ? and manufactured a durable niche product.\nThe campaign must know that altering a story line abruptly in the middle of a television season unsettles viewers who hate to see their favorite themes ditched. Changing a well-known brand is risky business because customers start thinking that their preferences are being ignored.\nRepublican front-runner Donald Trump has given some braggadocious victory speeches in the past, but his remarks after New York's primary on April 19 showed a newly polished, presidential candidate. Here's a look at his changed style. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\nMany devotees of â€œThe Good Wifeâ€? never recovered from the murder of Will Gardner, the tough lawyer/love interest played by Josh Charles, who disappeared from the show. The New Trump may prove to be as problematic a commercial gambit as New Coke was three decades ago.\nItâ€™s true that the Trump product is lucky enough to be in a space where the competition is weak. Cruz may yet bump up his market share when the race moves to Indiana and California, but his negatives rival Trumpâ€™s. John Kasich can be appealing, but in a goofy way, and he is selling a moderate spirit to a GOP customer base whose dominant preference is ferociousness.\nBut there is another major brand to worry about, Hillary Clinton, who immensely strengthened her hand in the Democratic race with a 16-point victory over Bernie Sanders in New York.\nItâ€™s practically written into the news scripts that Clinton has an authenticity problem . The paradox, as one Clinton partisan argued to me recently, is that she has been unwilling to go full-bore in competing with Sandersâ€™s visionary big offers because she just doesnâ€™t believe thatâ€™s the way the world works. She canâ€™t be anything but a practical pragmatist, this supporter insisted, and thatâ€™s how sheâ€™ll run.\nIt would be a lovely irony if the retooled, restrained, professionalized New Trump made the same-as-always Clinton into the true representative of authenticity.\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

No â€œLyinâ€™ Ted,â€? less rambling and so on. Itâ€™s the conclusion that various TV types took away from the omissions that â€œDaily Showâ€? host Trevor Noah satirized last night . â€œWhat we got to see yesterday was a new Trump. He was succinct, disciplined and respectful,â€? riffed Noah. â€œWhich, according to the media, made him presidential as balls.â€?\nAfter cycling through a sampling of cable-news commentary praising Trump for being presidential and disciplined, Noah took the point a bit further: â€œAnd he wasnâ€™t racist, and he didnâ€™t call any female reporters a â€˜bimboâ€™! This guyâ€™s ready for the White House. â€¦ This is ridiculous. Trump has basically lowered the mediaâ€™s expectations so much that not insulting someone seems presidential to them.â€? Yes, thatâ€™s about right.\nInstead of focusing on how presidential Trump may sound on any given occasion, perhaps the media should note that Trump has a conscious strategy of shifting rhetoric: â€œI will be changing very rapidly.

(Richard Drew/Associated Press)\nEach week, In Theory ?takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week, weâ€™re talking about financialization. Need a primer? Catch up here .\nGautam Mukunda is an assistant professor at Harvard Business School and the author of â€œ Indispensable: When Leaders Really Matter.â€?\nThe American financial sector is incredibly unpopular. Even Donald Trump describes hedge funds as â€œgetting away with murder,â€? while Bernie Sanders has made attacking Wall Street the core of his campaign. Sanders focuses on corruption, making veiled ( and often not so veiled ) arguments that Wall Street donations and Hillary Clintonâ€™s paid speeches explain the failure to hold bankers responsible for the financial crisis.\nThis profoundly misunderstands the financial sectorâ€™s comprehensive ? and corrosive ? influence. Bribing politicians is for amateurs. Wall Street doesnâ€™t have to. It has power, and real power doesnâ€™t just give you the ability to pay or force other people to do what is in your interest ? it reshapes the way people think so that they want to do what is in your interest. Thatâ€™s the sort of power that the American financial sector wields in todayâ€™s financialized economy.\n[ Are we repeating history by letting our financial sector grow too large? ]\nFinancialization is the increase in the influence of financial markets, institutions and elites. Evidence ranging from historical studies going as far back as the 14th century to statistical analyses of the U.S. economy today shows that while an underdeveloped financial sector can cripple an economy, so does one that is too large. An International Monetary Fund analysis , for example, found that economic growth slows when private-sector credit reaches 80 to 100 percent of GDP. In 2014, private-sector credit in the United States was 197 percent of GDP.\nFinancialization increases the risk of crises like the one in 2008. It even increases inequality. In 1980, workers in finance were paid the same as workers in other sectors. Post-deregulation, by 2006, workers in finance were making 50 percent more than workers in other sectors ? exactly the same premium that workers in finance enjoyed just before the Great Depression and which vanished after the passage of Depression-era reforms. In 2006, senior executives on Wall Street made 300 percent more than their equivalents in the real economy. This excess is responsible for as much as one-fourth of the increase in American inequality since 1980.\nThe swollen financial sector misallocates capital by shifting investment from real assets (like factories) to financial ones, so company after company spends money buying their own stock instead of investing in their future. It misallocates talent by using status and money to lure people who would otherwise be creating value (e.g., by advancing technology) into finance, where they mainly reallocate it . Think of all the brilliant engineers who work to shave milliseconds off high-frequency trades instead of actually generating wealth.\nMost importantly, financialization shifts the way business and government think. Finance is an intermediary. Its job is to get capital to the people who can most productively use it. When the rest of the economy serves the needs of the financial sector, the tail of the economy is wagging the dog ? and thatâ€™s exactly what we see today. A 2003 survey, for example, showed that 78 percent of chief financial officers would â€œdestroy economic valueâ€? ? actually hurt their company ? if that helped them meet Wall Streetâ€™s demands.\nExecutive pay has skyrocketed largely because of stock compensation, which aligns executivesâ€™ behavior with shareholdersâ€™ interests and makes them ignore the interests of employees and communities. This is justified by citing executivesâ€™ â€œfiduciary responsibilityâ€? to maximize shareholder returns. The problem is that, as Lynn Stout has demonstrated , no such responsibility exists. It is simply a myth that enslaves companies to the whims of Wall Street.\n[ We canâ€™t save the economy unless we fix our debt addiction ]\nSimilarly, government caters far more to finance than any other sector of the economy, ranging from the 2008 bailout on spectacularly favorable terms to Justice Department actions against the major banks that levy tax-deductible fines but never hold any person responsible. Companies and government officials donâ€™t act in such self-defeating ways because theyâ€™re paid to do so; they act in these ways because the power and status of the financial sector convinces them that doing what it wants is the right thing to do.\nLooking at the financial sector this way means that we need to think about reform differently. Reforms should do more than just try to stop something like the 2008 financial crisis from happening again. What they really need to do is re-balance the economy ? shift finance back to its proper role as enabler, not master. Many reforms are opposed by the financial sector on the grounds that they will make Wall Street smaller and less profitable. If we want to de-financialize our economy, however ? which the United States was able to do in the wake of the Great Depression ? shrinking the power and profitability of the financial sector while allowing it to maintain its useful functions is what we must do.\nExplore these other perspectives:\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

John Kasich (R) criticized his party for a lack of ideas Wednesday in a wide-ranging and occasionally combative interview with The Washington Postâ€™s editorial board.\nKasich, who sees the April 26 primary in Maryland as a way to increase his delegate total, argued that neither of his rivals could win the presidency, because of their negativity.\nâ€œIf you donâ€™t have ideas, you got nothing, and frankly my Republican Party doesnâ€™t like ideas,â€? ?Kasich said. â€œThey want to be negative against things. We had Reagan, okay? Saint Ron. We had Kemp, he was an idea guy. Iâ€™d say Paul Ryan is driven mostly by ideas. He likes ideas. But you talk about most of â€™em, the party is knee-jerk â€˜against.â€™ Maybe thatâ€™s how they were created.â€?\n[ Read the transcript of John Kasichâ€™s interview with the Washington Post edtiorial board ]\nAfter Tuesdayâ€™s New York primary, where weeks of campaigning landed Kasich half a dozen delegates, the governor repeatedly emphasized his conservative credentials while taking care to define what â€œconservativeâ€? was.\nRepublican presidential candidate John Kasich met with The Washington Post editorial board on April 20. This is a full audio recording of that conversation. (Adriana Usero)\nâ€œIâ€™m gonna kill the Commerce Department,â€? Kasich said. â€œI donâ€™t know why you donâ€™t have an Education Department tied to the Labor Department.â€?\nKasich derided the idea of a carbon tax ? â€œIâ€™m not big on tax increasesâ€? ? and when challenged on the math behind his tax-cut plan, which many analysts say would increase deficits, he mocked the pretenses of experts.\nâ€œThe Center for a Responsible Budget ? what have they ever balanced?â€? he asked. â€œWhen there is certainty, both on the regulatory side, on the tax side, and on the spending side, you basically get economic growth. And look, if we find out that weâ€™re getting off the path, then weâ€™ll have to adjust.â€?\nFor more than a month, Kasich has been mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination with the pledged delegates awarded in primaries. Tuesdayâ€™s result in New York came close to slamming the same door on Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), something the senator addressed in an impromptu news conference Wednesday. While Cruz went on to call Kasich a â€œspoiler,â€? the Ohio governor agreed with him on one point: Front-runner Donald Trump was not entitled to the nomination if he failed to reach a simple majority of 1,237 delegates.\nâ€œOne time I made an 83 on my math test, and I did better than everybody else, and I asked the teacher: How come I donâ€™t have an A?â€? Kasich said. â€œThe teacher said, â€˜An A is 90.â€™ I said, â€˜Oh, I get it.â€™ Say he gets in there with 1,100 ? go get the rest of â€™em.â€?\nKasich went on to imagine a convention where he could appeal to Trump voters by respecting them. Citing his work in Ohio to calm tensions after a police shooting in Cleveland, Kasich said heâ€™d advanced past his â€œbombast years, where I was pounding on everybody.â€? He boasted of Ohioâ€™s fracking boom but emphasized that the state had probably â€œthe mostâ€? regulation of the ?natural gas industry in the country.\nHe also rejected the idea that he had moderated by opposing â€œbirthright citizenshipâ€? when he was a congressman and endorsing it as a governor.\nOhio Gov. John Kasich (R) speaks with the editorial board at The Washington Post on Wednesday. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\nâ€œI probably signed onto some bill,â€? shrugged Kasich. â€œSomebody probably walked up to me on the floor and said, â€˜how â€™bout putting your name on this?â€™ â€?\nAt other points, Kasich vigorously defended his record. He said that changes to Ohioâ€™s early voting law, opposed by Democrats, were simply fair and had been requested by local officials.\nâ€œDo you think 28?days of voting is restrictive?â€? Kasich asked. â€œHow many other states have 28?days of early voting?â€?\nKasich made a few stabs at populism, criticizing the President Obama-era Federal Reserve for its multiple rounds of quantitative easing. To Kasich, that only resulted in companies â€œbuying up more of their stock and making the rich richer.â€? He was otherwise light on criticism of the Obama administration.\nOn the District, Kasich dismissed the idea of statehood or a vote in Congress.\nâ€œI just donâ€™t see that we really need that, okay?â€? Kasich said. Referring to the Republicans who have stopped such proposals, ?Kasich said that â€œthey know thatâ€™s just more votes in the Democratic Party.â€?\nBut as he pondered the question some more, Kasich softened.\nâ€œThey send me a bill, and Iâ€™m president of the United States?â€? he said. â€œIâ€™ll read your editorials.â€?\nDavid Weigel is a national political correspondent covering the 2016 election and ideological movements.\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Jackson has been demoted to appearing on the back of the bill, even though there had been a movement to get him removed completely, on the grounds that he was a slave-owner, oversaw Indian removal as president, and didnâ€™t believe in paper money.\nIn a way, thatâ€™s perhaps as it should be. As Eric Foner, the renowned historian of the Civil War era, remarked to me today, the way to fully represent our history is to â€œadd, not necessarily to subtract.â€?\nThe move comes after a complicated series of events. The initial plan had been to remove Alexander Hamilton from the $10 and replace him with a woman. But the Hamilton-removal plan ran into fierce opposition from advocates who argued that he was a key early architect of our banking system ? a lobbying campaign that gained the support of Lin-Manuel Miranda, the author of the hit musical about Hamilton, which won a Pulitzer this week. Meanwhile, a grassroots movement targeting Jackson for removal and a push to put a woman on the $20 bill, to mark 2020 as the centennial of women gaining the right to vote, had also been gaining momentum for some time .\n"Women on 20s," a campaign started earlier this year that has since inspired bills in the House and the Senate, is trying to replace Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on $20 bills. (WomenOn20s.org)\nThe solution: Keep Hamilton on the $10; put Harriet Tubman on the front of the $20; and move Jackson to the back of that bill.\nTubman figures heavily in Professor Fonerâ€™s recent book about the abolitionist movement, â€œ Gateway to Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad .â€?\nâ€œI approve of this,â€? Foner told me today. â€œAndrew Jackson was a slave owner. Harriet Tubman was an extremely remarkable person who showed tremendous courage and resourcefulness, liberating 70 or 80 people under very difficult circumstances.â€?\nFoner stressed that honoring Tubman on the $20 bill actually represents a tremendous bumping up of her visibility, in the sense that now â€œevery single person in the country will be carrying around Harriet Tubman in his or her wallet.â€?\nBut, Foner added, this also goes to the core of a broader debate: what is the best way to publicly acknowledge all of the facets of our history?\nâ€œThe context is the ongoing debate over how history should be represented in public,â€? Foner said. â€œI approve of this. I think the best way to deal with it is to add, not necessarily subtract. The public recognition of history should represent the actual history. Including Harriet Tubman is more representative of the history of the United States.â€?\nâ€œIn the south, I donâ€™t think they should take down statues of Confederate leaders,â€? Foner continued. â€œThey should put up statues of black congressmen and senators. It makes the public history more accurately reflect our entire history.â€?\nNow the $20 bill literally represents two sides of our history ? slave ownership and abolitionism.\nâ€œUntil now the recognition has been one sided,â€? Foner concluded. â€œNow you have a bill which reflects both sides of a very important moment in American history.â€?\n?\nGreg Sargent writes The Plum Line blog, a reported opinion blog with a liberal slant -- what you might call â€œopinionated reportingâ€? from the left.\nopinions\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

President Barack Obama met Thursday with top officials from six Arab nations to discuss regional security issues in the Persian Gulf including the fight against the Islamic State militant group.\nThe meetings in Riyadh are meant to build on a similar summit convened last year at Camp David, the American presidentâ€™s Maryland retreat. They reflect an effort by the White House to reassure and coordinate with important but wary Mideast allies that harbor serious doubts about Obamaâ€™s outreach to Iran and U.S. policy toward the grinding civil war in Syria.\nObama and officials from the U.S.-allied countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council opened up talks Thursday morning by posing for a group photo. The leaders, meeting around a circular table in an ornate meeting room in the Diriyah Palace, made polite conversation and smiled for cameras, but offered no remarks.\nDefense Secretary Ash Carter, Secretary of State John Kerry, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and CIA Director John Brennan also attended the meeting.\nThe summit follows bilateral talks that Obama held with Saudi King Salman on Wednesday shortly after arriving in the kingdom. Besides Saudi Arabia, the GCC includes the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain.\n___\nTrump, Cruz feud shifts to luxury seaside resort\nHOLLYWOOD, Fla. ? The messy fight for the Republican presidential nomination is shifting to a luxury seaside resort in south Florida as Donald Trump and chief rival Ted Cruz quietly court party leaders ahead of another set of high-stakes delegate contests.\nCruz conceded publicly for the first time that he doesnâ€™t have enough support to claim the nomination before the partyâ€™s summertime national convention, but he also vowed Wednesday to block Trump from collecting the necessary delegates as well. The Texas conservative predicted a contested convention that many party loyalists fear could trigger an all-out Republican civil war.\nâ€œWhatâ€™s clear today is that we are headed to a contested convention,â€? Cruz told reporters in between private meetings with Republican National Committee members gathered at the Diplomat Resort & Spa for the first day of their three-day annual spring meeting.\nCampaigning in Indiana, Trump railed against his partyâ€™s leadership, even as his senior lieutenants courted GOP officials behind closed doors in Florida.\nâ€œItâ€™s a rigged, crooked system thatâ€™s designed so that the bosses can pick whoever they want and that people like me canâ€™t run and canâ€™t defend you against foreign nonsense,â€? Trump charged at the Indiana State Fairgrounds.\n___\n10 Things to Know for Today\nYour daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about today:\n1.

US MONEY MAKEOVER\nHarriet Tubman, an African-American abolitionist born into slavery, will replace Andrew Jackson as the new face on the $20 bill.\n___\nHistoric makeover: Harriet Tubman to be face on $20 bill\nWASHINGTON ? U.S. paper money is getting a historic makeover.\nHarriet Tubman, an African-American abolitionist born into slavery, will be the new face on the $20 bill.\nThe leader of the Underground Railroad is replacing the portrait of Andrew Jackson, the nationâ€™s seventh president and a slave owner, who is being pushed to the back of the bill.\nAnd Alexander Hamilton, the nationâ€™s first Treasury secretary whoâ€™s enjoying a revival thanks to a hit Broadway play, will keep his spot on the $10 note after earlier talk of his removal.\nThe changes are part of a currency redesign announced Wednesday by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, with the new $20 marking two historic milestones: Tubman will become the first African-American on U.S. paper money and the first woman to be depicted on currency in 100 years.\n___\nParis climate deal on track for early start\nUNITED NATIONS ? About 160 countries are expected to sign the Paris Agreement on climate change Friday in a symbolic triumph for a landmark deal that once seemed unlikely but now appears on track to enter into force years ahead of schedule.\nU.N. officials say the signing ceremony Friday will set a record for international diplomacy: Never before have so many countries inked an agreement on the first day of the signing period.\nThat could help pave the way for the pact to become effective long before the original 2020 deadline ? possibly this year? though countries must first formally approve it through their domestic procedures.\nâ€œWe are within striking distance of having the agreement start years earlier than anyone anticipated,â€? Brian Deese, an adviser to President Barack Obama, said in a speech last week at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.\nThe U.S. and China, which together account for nearly 40 percent of global emissions, have said they intend to formally join the agreement this year. It will enter into force once 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions have done so.\n___\nAPNewsBreak: Senate candidate bills campaign for family trip\nINDIANAPOLIS ? A Facebook page belonging to the wife of an Indiana congressman touted the familyâ€™s visit to the Ronald Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley, California, with photos showing the two children by the conservative iconâ€™s grave and the couple in front of a â€œhumbleâ€? wooden table where Reagan signed a massive tax cut.\nAlthough a caption on one of the photos describes the trip as a â€œfamily vacation,â€? documents obtained by The Associated Press show Rep. Marlin Stutzmanâ€™s Senate campaign paid more than $2,000 for the four airline tickets to Los Angeles and covered expenses for a van rental and Hilton hotel room recorded during the August trip. Federal Election Commission guidelines forbid the use of an official campaign fund for personal expenses.\nOn Wednesday, Stutzman campaign manager Josh Kelley said the candidate repaid the campaign fund last week for the familyâ€™s portion of the trip after the AP began asking questions about it. Kelley said Stutzman was told last August by a campaign attorney that the trip was a â€œlegitimateâ€? campaign expense because Stutzmanâ€™s wife and children joined him at some political functions, but he decided to repay it â€œin the interests of full disclosure.â€?\nThe California visit represents just a small part of the over $300,000 in flights, vehicle charges, meals and hotel stays Stutzmanâ€™s campaign fund has spent since the tea party-backed Republican went to Washington in 2010 on a pledge to oppose special interests, an AP review found. Thatâ€™s roughly three times more than Rep. Todd Young, his GOP Senate rival in the May 3 primary who joined the House about the same time.\nRegarding the six-day California trip, Kelley declined to elaborate about the political events he said the family attended, other than to say some included donors and constituents. Kelley said the Hilton expense was incurred in Indianapolis the night before the California trip but provided no specifics.\n___\nAPNewsBreak: EU keeps sanctions threat on Thai seafood\nBRUSSELS ? The European Union is maintaining the threat of a seafood import ban on Thailand because the global exporter is still not doing enough to improve its fisheries and labor practices, officials said Thursday.\nThe 28-nation EU is keeping up the pressure because even some Thai legislation enacted last year to curb illegal practices was not sufficiently followed up by action over the past months, two EU officials with knowledge of the ongoing talks told the Associated Press.\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is seen as a major contributor to dwindling fish stocks across the globe, while in Thailand it has also led to illegal labor practices amounting in some cases to slave labor.\nâ€œWe continue to have serious concerns about the steps taken by the Thai authorities to fight illegal and unregulated fishing activities. This means that further action by the EU Commission cannot be ruled out,â€? said one official, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the talks. Thai authorities insist they are working hard to fundamentally change the practices of the past.\nThe news that Thailand would continue to work under a so-called yellow card threat came Thursday as the EU Commission took Sri Lanka off the list after threatening it with sanctions for four years, the official said, lauding the island nation in the Indian Ocean for its reforms. At the same time Kiribati, Sierra Leone and Trinidad and Tobago were slapped with yellow cards for not cooperating.\n___\nVolkswagen reaches judgeâ€™s deadline for diesel car fix\nSAN FRANCISCO ? Time is up for Volkswagen to meet a federal judgeâ€™s deadline to detail how it will make nearly 600,000 diesel cars rigged to cheat on emissions tests comply with clean air laws.\nSenior U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said he wanted to know the timing of the fix and any planned payments to vehicle owners by a court hearing set for Thursday. That is when a deal is expected to be announced between Volkswagen, the U.S. government and private lawyers for the automaker to buy back some of the vehicles and spend just over $1 billion to compensate owners, a person briefed on the matter said.\nThe agreement would give some owners the choice of having Volkswagen repair their cars or buy them back, but it does not include plans on how to repair the vehicles, according to the person,
 who asked not to be identified because the deal hadnâ€™t been made public.\nThose plans, and the cost of the fixes, apparently are still under negotiation.\nCompensation for car owners was among the details Breyer was seeking, but the judge was more focused on ending the ongoing pollution by getting the vehicles to comply with clean air laws.\n___\n1990s WWE wrestling star Chyna dies in Southern California\nREDONDO BEACH, Calif. ? Chyna, the WWE star who in the 1990s became one of the best-known and most-popular female professional wrestlers in history, has died, authorities said.\nPolice in Southern California said they were responding to a 911 call from a friend of former WWE wrestler Chyna when they found her dead in her Redondo Beach apartment.\nA friend had gone Wednesday to check on Chyna, whose real name is Joan Marie Laurer, after she had failed to answer her phone for a few days, Redondo Beach police said in a statement. The friend told the 911 operator that Laurer wasnâ€™t breathing.\nThe 46-year-old Laurer was dead when officers arrived, police said. Several media outlets report that she was 45.\nNeither police nor coronerâ€™s officials have released any cause of death.\n___\nUKâ€™s Cameron hails â€˜steadfastâ€™ queen on her 90th birthday\nLONDON ? Queen Elizabeth II ? Britainâ€™s oldest and longest-serving monarch ? is celebrating her 90th birthday Thursday with a day at home and a short walk.\nHer government and subjects are adding gun salutes, fireworks, tributes in Parliament and televised retrospectives of a life that has stretched from the Roaring â€˜20s to the Internet age.\nThe queen was born Princess Elizabeth on April 21, 1926 and became queen on the death of her father, King George VI, in 1952. A majority of Britons have lived under no other monarch.\nIn a birthday message, Prime Minister David Cameron said the queen â€œhas lived through some extraordinary times,â€? from World War II to the moon landing, the end of the Cold War and advent of peace in Northern Ireland.\nHe said that â€œHer Majesty has been steadfast ? a rock of strength for our nation, for our Commonwealth and on many occasions for the whole world.â€?\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Lindsley between 1860 and 1870. Library of Congress via Reuters\nMidway through the Civil War, Harriet Tubman made a gutsy decision: Sheâ€™d serve the Union Army on a raid up South Carolinaâ€™s Combahee River, providing intelligence to commanders in person that she had gathered about the location of Confederate mines and other threats.\nThe June 2, 1863, military operation is an often overlooked detail about the life of Tubman, an abolitionist who is best known for her role as a conductor on the Underground Railroad that freed tens of thousands of slaves from Americaâ€™s South during the 1800s. But with the Treasury Department set to announce Wednesday that Tubman will replace President Andrew Jackson on the front of the $20 bill, itâ€™s noteworthy that her legacy extends beyond her extensive contributions to the abolition movement and into her work as a Union spy who oversaw a Special Operations unit of sorts, according to numerous accounts, including one by the U.S. Army .\nTubmanâ€™s work for the Union Army began after Massachusetts Gov. John A. Andrew, an abolitionist, reached out to Tubman for help in working with slaves owned by plantation owners who had fled the South in the face of potential bloodshed. The slaves often sought help at Union military camps, putting a burden on Army units that already were in difficult combat conditions.\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew has announced majors changes to three U.S. currency notes in the coming years after long and controversial process. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)\n[ Harriet Tubman to appear on $20 bill, while Alexander Hamilton remains on $10 bill ]\nThe governor sent Tubman to Maj. Gen. David Hunter, a Union Commander in South Carolina, who issued her a pass in February 1863 that ordered his troops to provide her with transportation as needed, according to the book â€œ Harriet Tubman: The Moses of Her People ,â€? which was first published in 1869.\nâ€œHarriet was sent to me from Boston by Governor Andrew, and is a valuable woman,â€? the generalâ€™s pass read, in part. â€œShe has permission, as a servant of the Government, to purchase such provisions from the Commissary as she may need.â€?â€?\nAccording to the Armyâ€™s account, Tubman established a nine-man spy unit comprising local black riverboat pilots who knew the waterways well and taught them how to collect intelligence. They scouted for the Union, mapping the islands and shores of South Carolina and providing information about the location of Confederate sentinels.\nTubman also is credited with helping to establish the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment, which was led by Col. James Montgomery. He would go on to order the controversial June 11, 1863, looting and burning of Darien, Ga., that is depicted in the 1989 movie â€œGlory,â€? starring Matthew Broderick and Denzel Washington. Before that, however, came the daring raid up the?Combahee River between South Carolinaâ€™s Beaufort and Colleton counties.\nAccording to the Army account, Montgomery asked Tubman to lead several gunboats up the river, and she agreed as long as he commanded the operation. She determined the location of mines in the river by sailing up the river ahead of time with members of her team and meeting with slaves who had placed the ordnance. She offered a chance at freedom ? and in at least some cases, cash ? in exchange for the information.\nTwo Union gunboats, the Harriet A. Weed and the John Adams, eventually made their way up the river with raiders seizing food and other supplies that Tubman had mapped ahead of time. They freed more than 700 slaves, according to most historic accounts.\nA history of the raid published three years ago by the New York Times suggests that about 100 of those slaves eventually joined the Union Army ? fewer than Union commanders had hoped, but still inspiring at the time. Tubman continued to serve in the military for at least another year, working as a nurse and continuing to communicate with South Carolinians who could provide information.\nTubmanâ€™s clandestine past in the Union military, meanwhile, gets passing mention on occasion. Last fall, it was featured on Comedy Centralâ€™s â€œDrunk History,â€? which referred to her as a â€œsuperspy.â€? A bridge over the Combahee River was named after her in 2008 .\nDan Lamothe covers national security for The Washington Post and anchors its military blog, Checkpoint.\nworld\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

In one memorable C-Span clip , Americans called in with their picks:\nHarriet Tubman.\nPrincess Diana.\nHarriet Tubman.\nAs chatter grew about? why Tubman should become the first woman to grace our paper currency ??accompanied by a simultaneous activist-run web campaign to get a woman on the $20 bill ? writer Feminista Jones presented a controversial counter-argument in an essay that went viral . Thereâ€™s no place for women, especially women of color, she asserted, on Americaâ€™s money.\nWrote Jones:\nHarriet Tubman did not fight for capitalism, free trade, or competitive markets. She repeatedly put herself in the line of fire to free people who were treated as currency themselves. She risked her life to ensure that enslaved black people would know they were worth more than the blood money that exchanged hands to buy and sell them. I do not believe Tubman, who died impoverished in 1913, would accept the â€œhonor.â€?\nHistorians say Tubman, the most famous of the Underground Railroad's conductors , was born a slave around 1820 in Maryland. She ran?away in 1849, following the North Star by night to Philadelphia.\nThe next year, after saving money as a maid, she returned south to save her sisterâ€™s family. Then she returned for others. For the next decade, she guided more than 300 slaves to freedom, risking her life and freedom over 19 trips.\nShe will not appear on the $10 bill, which will be the first redesign to hit American wallets, in 2020, Lew said Wednesday. Alexander Hamilton, awash in unexpected Broadway fame, will hold his position with a new addition of suffragists. ??\n[ Harriet Tubman to appear on $20 bill, while Alexander Hamilton remains on $10 bill ]\nTubman will instead become the new face of the $20 bill (with Jackson relegated to the back). He elaborated in an open letter:\nThe decision to put Harriet Tubman on the new $20 was driven by thousands of responses we received from Americans young and old. ?I have been particularly struck by the many comments and reactions from children for whom Harriet Tubman is not just a historical figure, but a role model for leadership and participation in our democracy. ?\nA spokesperson for the Treasury would not say when, exactly, the new $20 bill will come out.\nZoe Samudzi, a feminist writer in Oakland, promptly told her 14,300 Twitter followers Wednesday the Treasury got it wrong. Tubman, she wrote, was bought and sold as a commodity. And the government celebrates her byâ€¦ putting her on money?\nâ€œI'd imagine the Treasury aren't masters of irony,â€? Samudzi told The Post in an email, â€œbut Iâ€™m mulling over the irony of a black woman who was bought and sold being â€˜commemoratedâ€™ on the $20 bill (without also taking steps for economic recompense for black folks who are descendants of enslaved peoples) and I can't stop shaking my head.â€?\nEvelyn Brooks Higginbotham , a professor of history and African American studies at Harvard University, saw the development as positive. Tubman wasnâ€™t against money, she said. She spent?it?to pry others from slave owners.\nâ€œShe used hers to go back into a?place where she had a bounty on her head,â€? Higginbotham said. â€œIt says something about how she thinks about money. She used money as a way to help mankind.â€?\n(At the end of her life, it turns out, Tubman received a pension check every month for being both a veteran and the widow of a veteran. The amount? $20 .)\nClara Small, ?a retired history professor at Salisbury University , who has written about the history of slavery in Maryland, said she expected backlash. She remembered the short life of the Susan B.

(Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)\nBlack abolitionist leader Harriet Tubman will appear on the front of the $20 bill, relocating the slaveholding former president Andrew Jackson to its rear, and founding father Alexander Hamilton will remain on the face of the $10 bill.\nThe changes were announced Wednesday by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew as part of a historic overhaul of U.S. currency aimed at addressing Americaâ€™s legacy of slavery and gender inequality. They came after a viral online campaign to feature a woman on the currency and, later, a push to preserve Hamiltonâ€™s place by historians and fans of the hit Broadway musical bearing his name.\nLew called Tubmanâ€™s story â€œthe essential story of American democracyâ€? and the power of an individual to make a difference, adding that â€œso much of what we believe has changed for better for this country is reflected in what she struggled for.â€?\nThe saga over how U.S. currency would recognize the role of women and minorities has been fraught since the Treasuryâ€™s announcement last summer that it would seek to feature a woman on the $10 bill, the next in line to be redesigned with additional features to guard against counterfeiting and to assist the blind.\nThe choice involved questions of who, on millions of pieces of paper currency, would represent the achievements of women and minorities in American history, and which historical figures to displace to make room for them.\nIn the hotly anticipated unveiling, Lew described other changes to the $5 and $10 bills. Fans of Hamilton had worried that an announcement last year by the Treasury that it would put a woman on the $10 bill would displace the father of the modern U.S. economic system. But the new $10 bill will now recognize the role of women by featuring on its back an image of the 1913 march for womenâ€™s suffrage that ended at the Treasury Department. It will also honor womenâ€™s suffrage leaders such as Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Sojourner Truth.\nThe back of the new $5 bill, which features Abraham Lincoln on the front, will honor the civil rights movement with depictions of Martin Luther King Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt and black opera singer Marian Anderson, who famously sang on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1939. Treasury hopes to release the design concept for the new bills by 2020, the 100th anniversary of womenâ€™s suffrage, but it could take years more for all the bills to enter circulation.\nâ€œIt is just absolutely beautiful to replace Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman, because where Jackson represented the worst side of American history, Tubman represents the best ideals of American democracy,â€? said Kari Winter, a professor who studies slavery and dissent at the University at?Buffalo. â€œShe really represents the highest ideals of community, working for the common good, thinking about others beside yourself, risking everything for justice.â€?\nTubman, who was born a slave in Maryland about 1820, will be the first African American and first black woman whose picture appears on U.S. currency. She helped bring dozens of slaves to freedom in her lifetime through the network of abolitionists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. She escaped when she was in her 20s but returned to secretly help her family members and dozens of other slaves escape to freedom. Tubman suffered from fits and seizures, the result of physical trauma received when she was a slave, according to Catherine Clintonâ€™s biography of Tubman, called â€œHarriet Tubman: The Road to Freedom.â€?\nLater in life, she served as a Union Army spy during the Civil War, where she aided the North by scouting terrain and recruiting slaves as soldiers. Before her death in her late 80s or early 90s, she was an outspoken activist for womenâ€™s right to vote.\nThe last woman represented on U.S. notes was Martha Washington, on the $1 silver certificate, while several other women have been featured on coins.\nThough it had been contemplating a change for years, Treasury was moved in part by a viral campaign in early 2015 to put a womanâ€™s portrait on the new $20 bill in 2020 ? to mark the centennial of womenâ€™s suffrage. The group â€œWomen on $20sâ€? received more than 600,000 votes for a choice of 15 American women, including Rosa Parks and Eleanor Roosevelt. Tubman received the most votes.\nAlmost everyone celebrated Lewâ€™s decision to feature a woman. But, for some economists and historians, there was a vociferous reaction against the choice ? never clearly stated but widely assumed ? to relocate Hamilton from the front of the $10 bill. They noted ruefully that Hamilton was the mastermind behind Americaâ€™s financial system, while Jackson, the seventh president, was a fervent opponent of a nationally integrated economic system whose tenure included a violent campaign against Native Americans.\nBen Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, wrote in June that he was â€œappalledâ€? at the idea of removing Hamilton from his position on the $10 and that honoring a woman on a paper bill was â€œa fine idea, but it shouldnâ€™t come at Hamiltonâ€™s expense.â€?\nHamilton received added support after the breakout hit of the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical â€œHamilton,â€? a hip-hop biography of the first Treasury secretary that is one of Broadwayâ€™s biggest sensations in years. Miranda, who first got notice for his unusual take after a White House appearance seven years ago, won the Pulitzer Prize in Drama this week for â€œHamilton.â€?\nAfter a visit to Washington last month, Miranda himself assured his anxious fans that Lew told him he would be â€œvery happyâ€? with the new $10. â€œ#wegetthejobdone,â€? Miranda tweeted.\nBut as the Treasury gave hints it would acquiesce to pressure to retain Hamiltonâ€™s prominence, some womenâ€™s groups were alarmed that he might delay his promise to move forward in featuring a woman. On Wednesday, there was mixed reaction to the Treasury announcement.\nLisa Maatz, the vice president of government relations for the American Association of University Women, said that her organizationâ€™s members were â€œthrilledâ€? by Harriet Tubmanâ€™s ascension to the front of the $20. However, the ultimate decision to keep Hamilton on the front of the $10 was a disappointment. â€œObviously we donâ€™t feel like women need to settle for just one bill. I think getting women on the front of more than one bill would be a great idea.â€?\nOthers were more positive. â€œIâ€™m very happy because of the fact that these changes are going to occur simultaneously,â€? said the founder of the â€œWomen on 20sâ€? campaign, Barbara Ortiz Howard.\nOn Twitter, Hillary Clinton, running to be the first female president, wrote: â€œA woman, a leader, and a freedom fighter. I canâ€™t think of a better choice for the $20 bill than Harriet Tubman.â€?\nRepublican presidential candidates did not offer an immediate response to the decision. In a September debate, they were asked who theyâ€™d put on the $10 bill. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz both agreed it should be Rosa Parks. (though Cruz said she would be more appropriate on the $20 bill.) John Kasich said Mother Teresa.\nâ€œUnited States history is not Andrew Jackson versus Harriet Tubman. It is Andrew Jackson and Harriet Tubman, both heroes of a nationâ€™s work in progress toward great goals,â€? said Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, which Jackson also represented in Congress. â€œIt is unnecessary to diminish Jackson in order to honor Tubman. Jackson was the first common man to be elected president.â€?\nOthers objected to the decision to feature Tubman because they said it was inconsistent with her history.\nâ€œIâ€™d imagine the Treasury arenâ€™t masters of irony,â€? feminist writer Zoe Samudzi told The Washington Post in an email, â€œbut Iâ€™m mulling over the irony of a black woman who was bought and sold being â€˜commemoratedâ€™ on the $20 bill (without also taking steps for economic recompense for black folks who are descendants of enslaved peoples) and I canâ€™t stop shaking my head.â€?\nAn earlier version of this story mischaracterized?Marian Anderson's biography.

(Andrew Harnik/Associated Press)\nThere was no single issue in recent weeks on which Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) differed more sharply than on Israel. With Clinton trouncing Sanders in a city with the largest Jewish population ?per capita (overwhelmingly Democratic) in the country, it is worth looking at the political ramifications for Clintonâ€™s overt pro-Israel stance.\nThe choice could not have been more stark.? Sanders embraced the J Street view that Israel is guilty of war crimes (for â€œindiscriminateâ€? shelling of Gaza) and is morally equivalent ? and equally to blame ? for the failure to achieve peace with the Palestinians. He was roundly condemned by the former Israeli ambassador to the United States and by pro-Israel groups. He vowed to be more critical of Israel.\nClinton robustly and frequently rebutted that approach. She defended Israelâ€™s right to protect its citizens ;?condemned the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement; promised to invite the Israeli prime minister to the White House; argued that disputes should be resolved quickly and quietly and demanded the Palestinians stop inciting violence. There was no mistaking who was the pro-Israel candidate in this contest. Only Clinton embraced the pre-Obama tradition of bipartisan support for the Jewish state. She delivered a well-received speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) policy conference; Sanders did not bother to show up.\nNow, no one could seriously argue that Clinton won because of her Israel views, although 59 percent of Democratic voters thought she would be the better commander in chief compared with only 38 percent for Sanders. It, however, is equally true that a fierce, reasoned defense of Israel is not a liability for a Democrat, even in a liberal bastion such as New York. In the general election, her stance will aid the defense of her own foreign-policy record and win over some independent and Republican pro-Israel voters who abhorred President Obamaâ€™s anti-Israel tilt.\nPerhaps Democrats will rediscover that a pro-Israel stance is both good politics and good policy.?While the Republican Jewish Coalition cannot bring itself to condemn Donald Trump, Democrats through their nominee will shore up any Jewish support lost during the Obama years. In a Trump-Clinton race, one can imagine 90 percent or more of the Jewish vote going to Clinton.\nAside from the politics of the presidential race, the potential for a pro-Israel Democrat president who was outspoken in differentiating herself from Obama would be hugely significant. Rather than deepen the trend of Democratic antipathy toward Israel ? and the corresponding development of Israel as a partisan issue in which only Republicans reliably provided defense of the Jewish state ? the almost extinguished hope for a return to bipartisan support for Israel could become a reality. Advocates of a strong U.S.-Israel relationship and an effective U.S. presence in the Middle East can breathe a little easier knowing things will in all likelihood improve regardless of who wins the White House.\nThe importance of restoring Americaâ€™s image as a nation that stands by its friends and ending the public animosity between the United States and Israel cannot be overestimated. There will continue to be differences between Democrats and Republicans on issues affecting Israel, ranging from Iran policy to willingness to get tough with the Palestinian Authority. But these, one hopes, will once again be matters of degree. If both parties can agree that Israel is not the problem, but rather, the one functioning democracy and true ally in the region, and that creating â€œdaylightâ€? between the United States and Israel?harms both sides, the disastrous Obama years may become a distant, bitter memory for both countries and the pro-Israel community.\nThose looking for a ray of sunshine in a depressing election season can, at least, cling to this promising development.\nJennifer Rubin writes the Right Turn blog for The Post, offering reported opinion from a conservative perspective.\nopinions\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\nAs we noted yesterday, Hillary Clintonâ€™s big win in New York after emphasizing her pro-Israel credentials came as a blow to Israelâ€™s critics, who heavily backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The extent to which the anti-Israel left went in for Sanders and the magnitude of its defeat is only now coming to light. And it is bringing smiles to the faces of the pro-Israel community, which suffered a devastating loss when Senate Democrats filibustered a measure disapproving the Iran deal and more generally have endured seven-plus rocky years with a president who openly displays his animus toward Israel.\nOfficials from multiple Jewish organizations examined the returns for evidence of Clintonâ€™s success with Jewish voters. They were not disappointed. â€œClinton seemed to prevail in districts known to have large Jewish populations,â€? JTA noted . â€œIn Kings County, or Brooklyn, the former New York senator led Sanders 60-40 percent and in New York County, or Manhattan, she led 66-34.â€? She did better than her statewide percentage ?in particularly Jewish neighborhoods, including Crown Heights South, Riverdale, and the Upper West and East Sides.\nOne groupâ€™s analysis showed that Clinton won 62 to 67 percent of the vote in the six congressional districts with the largest Jewish populations, all with Jewish population shares of 20 percent or greater. In Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadlerâ€™s NY-10, the most Jewish congressional district in the country, Clinton beat Sanders 67 percent to 33 percent.?Indeed, the Jewish vote gave her one of her best showings among white voters (50 percent) to date.?\nThe Jewish communityâ€™s importance has garnered plenty of attention.? Haaretz? quoted?Ezra Friedlander, chief executive of the Friedlander Group, in a report from Jewish Insider as saying, â€œClintonâ€™s margin of victory in Jewish communities across NYC will not go unnoticed at the highest levels of the Clinton campaign and the DNC. This might be the catalyst for a rapprochement between the Orthodox communities and the national Democratic party which has seen an erosion in support of national Democrats.â€?\nTo reach out to the Jewish community, Clinton used interviews in free media, her debate time and AIPAC speech and her opponentâ€™s own words against him with great success.?Haaretz quotes a Jewish activist as saying, â€œAfter weeks that saw misinformed anti-Israel comments by Sanders, the hiring of a radical leftist as the campaignâ€™s Jewish outreach director, and the doubling down on Israel at the debate in Brooklyn, we felt that it was imperative to go out and inform voters that a vote for Bernie Sanders was a dangerous mistake.â€? They apparently convinced a lot of their friends.\nThe big losers in the Sanders vs. Clinton fight ? other than Sanders himself ? were a whoâ€™s who in the anti-Israel lobbying and propaganda world who had aligned themselves with Sanders and defended his positions. J Street had become his go-to adviser ? along with the head of the radical leftist? Ploughshares Fund ,?Joe Cirincione (who spent a good deal of effort tweeting on the race, both? heckling Clinton and defending Sandersâ€™s ?extreme positions). Among Clintonâ€™s most vociferous critics was?the pro-Iran group NIAC, which? blasted her for daring to suggest that she wanted to keep her options open on further efforts to normalize relations as a check on Iranian misbehavior. All of that effort came to naught as New York liberals, and specifically Jewish New Yorkers, soundly rejected Sanders.?She now owes nothing ? other than a headache ? to Israel antagonists like J Street, whom the Obama administration treated as a legitimate pro-Israel group.\nThe pro-Israel community can say it made a substantial difference in Clintonâ€™s most important victory. With that comes the pro-Israel communityâ€™s determination to see Clintonâ€™s words translated into consistent action. True friends of Israel and defenders of the Israel-U.S. relationship are certain to be vigilant. Large numbers of Jewish voters were snookered by Obamaâ€™s pro-Zionist pretensions in 2008; they do not intend to be fooled twice ? or to go to bat for a candidate who in office pulls a bait-and-switch.\nJennifer Rubin writes the Right Turn blog for The Post, offering reported opinion from a conservative perspective.\nopinions\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(REUTERS/Jim Young)\nEither Donald Trump has recaptured the momentum in the presidential primary, or there is no such thing as momentum. Either Ohio Gov. John Kasich is enabling Trump to reach 1,237 delegates or, as Kasichâ€™s campaign chief John Weaver spun in a memo, â€œa serious effortâ€? from him can keep Trumpâ€™s numbers down in races next week. Either Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) had the New York loss baked into his delegate strategy or he spent too much time there when he should have been in more winnable April 26 states such as Pennsylvania. Look hard enough and you can find people willing to defend and data to support just about any of these propositions.\nWhat we do know is that Donald Trump is the only Republican candidate who mathematically can still wrap up the nomination before the convention, although he will need to win about 63 percent of the remaining delegates to get to 1,237. We can also be certain Kasich is not exiting the race, although he might not be placed into nomination on the first round of balloting, depending on the convention rules. Given the Cruz delegate operation, it is widely believed that the only realistic chance for Trumpâ€™s nomination comes on the first round of balloting. Thereafter Cruz is the prohibitive favorite.\nWhether Trump, Cruz or someone else emerges as the GOP nominee depends on the answers to a number of questions, including:\n1. Can Trump stay off the air and under Paul Manafortâ€™s thumb long enough to avoid more embarrassing gaffes? Remaining off the Sunday shows for two weeks and sticking to notes spared him the nonstop gaffes that took his campaign off track before the Wisconsin primary. Two weeks, though, is not two months. As the New York Times reports, â€œEven some of Mr. Trumpâ€™s allies privately doubt that he can control his outbursts.â€? The Republican National Committee is reportedly considering another debate. Trump would almost certainly prefer to avoid any setting in which disaster might strike; avoiding a debate, however, carries its risks as well insofar as his opponents will paint him as a coward.\n2. Does Trumpâ€™s refusal to release his taxes come into play? There is almost certainly an issue with his returns (even if it is â€œonlyâ€? that he is not as rich as he says) or he would have gotten this out of the way. Both the RNC (via the bully pulpit and rules) and his opponents should be demanding he release his returns before the convention. No delegate should be expected to take a â€œtrust meâ€? from him.\n3. Will Hillary Clintonâ€™s success in wrapping up her nomination affect the GOP? As she consolidates her support?and turns her fire full-time on Trump,?her lead over Trump may well increase, reinforcing concerns that his nomination will mean a wipe-out for the GOP. While that argument has not worked to boost Kasich into consideration, it might be a factor in tipping delegates from Trump to Cruz.\n4. Do Trumpâ€™s claims that the process is rigged backfire? Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is the latest to dismiss Trumpâ€™s complaints out of hand. â€œThis is the way the way the system has been for a long time in both parties. If a primary and caucuses do not decide the nominee, it then goes to the convention,â€? he told a Miami radio host. As he put it, â€œI think the argument that Trump is making is this game ? just like the economy, heâ€™s saying, the politics is â€˜rigged.â€™ Well, I wouldnâ€™t call it rigged. These are the rules. He knew the rules, or should have, going in.â€? The more Trump complains, the more it may seem to delegates that he is politically amateurish, and worse, accusing them of misconduct.\n5. Does a third candidate shock the RNC delegates into picking a non-Trump nominee? Trump and the RNC seem oblivious to ? or in denial about ? the very likely emergence of a third candidate if Trump is the nominee. Trump would have us believe he and his delegates will storm the barricades if he does not get the nomination; what he and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus fail to appreciate is that the many delegates plus a great number of donors, activists and voters wonâ€™t tolerate Trump as the nominee. They will bolt the party. If a plausible figure arises who by then has had success in qualifying for the ballot around the country, there may be a strong push for Cruz or another consensus candidate.\n6. Does someone pick a VP early? Any of the three contenders could name someone, including a current or past opponent. A smart pick might bring over a delegation or put to rest, for example, the notion that Cruz cannot work with ideologically dissimilar Republicans. Alternatively, a disastrous pick might convince delegates the candidate cannot be trusted.\nAnyone at this point who claims to know how this is going to turn out is conning you. It is impossible to account for the twists and turns that are bound to occur before and during the convention. That wonâ€™t stop talking heads on the cable shows from pulling out their crystal balls, but you can safely ignore their prognostication. Youâ€™re going to need to be patient this year. We may not know the GOP nominee until late July ? and whether he will have conservative competition from a third candidate.\nJennifer Rubin writes the Right Turn blog for The Post, offering reported opinion from a conservative perspective.\nopinions\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\nHARTFORD, Conn. ? Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton declined Thursday to urge challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders out of the primary race, but said she hopes he follows her 2008 model of endorsing and helping her if she defeats him.\nâ€œThatâ€™s up to him. I would never tell anybody what to do,â€? Clinton said during a town hall-style interview on ABCâ€™s â€œGood Morning America.â€?\nThe interview aired live from Times Square in New York before Clinton was due in Connecticut for a campaign stop aimed at rallying support for Tuesdayâ€™s primary vote here.\nâ€œThat has to be a very personal decision,â€? she said of when to call off a primary bid. â€œBut as I said, look, we have to come together as a country.â€?\nShe recounted how she fought a tough primary battle with then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008 throughout the entire calendar of state contests.\nâ€œHe ended up with more delegates and I withdrew. I endorsed him, then I got to work,â€? she said.\nShe added that when she pulled out in June of that year, some 40 percent of her supporters told pollsters they would not support Obama. That didnâ€™t last, but it took her work and example to heal the rift, Clinton said.\nâ€œI had to get to work and I had to make the case. I nominated him at the convention. I went from group to group, even as late as the convention, convincing people who were my delegates to come together, to unify,â€? she said.\nThen as now, she agrees with her rival much more than she disagrees with him, she said.\nâ€œWe were successful, thank goodness, and he was elected," she said of Obama, who went on to name her as his first secretary of state. "So I'm hoping that the same thing will happen this time.â€?\nSanders has said he intends to remain in the race through the party convention in July. He and his allies maintain that despite a deficit of more than 200 pledged delegates, he can make up ground and win the nomination.\nSanders lost badly to Clinton in New York on Tuesday and is running well behind her in Pennsylvania and Maryland, the two largest states that vote next week. He could win in one or more of the smaller, heavily white states voting April 26: Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware.\nClinton leads Sanders 58 percent to 31 percent among registered Democratic likely voters in Pennsylvania in a Franklin & Marshall College poll released Thursday.\nClinton was confining her campaigning in Connecticut on Thursday to the biggest city, Hartford. The YMCA where she was speaking to a modest mid-day crowd is in a scruffy neighborhood where trash blew on the sidewalks and graffiti covered some boarded-up windows. Residents leaned over the balcony of a crumbling apartment house across the street to watch supporters lining up outside.\nSpeaking at a forum in Hartford, Conn., Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton called for "a national movement" to change how Americans think about and use guns. Clinton praised Connecticut for reforms made in the state to gun legislation. (Reuters)\nClinton has vastly outperformed Sanders in urban areas in recent contests, including New York. She won every major city in the state except Albany, while Sanders won just about everywhere else and still lost by about 20 points. That is largely a reflection of the racial split that has come to define the Clinton-Sanders battle: She does better among minorities, he does best among white voters.\nClintonâ€™s campaign accuses Sanders of souring the previously cordial Democratic race, but he has said he is only drawing fair comparisons about her ties to Wall Street and other issues. Some Clinton supporters have grown nervous about what they call Sandersâ€™s attacks, which Republicans including front-runner Donald J. Trump are already repeating.\nClinton was asked to respond to a recent Trump remark about Sanders calling her unqualified.\nâ€œObviously primary campaigns, general election campaigns, there's going to be a lot of contrasts drawn. People are going to fight hard to get the votes to win. I totally buy that. That's what we do, but let's not lose sight of what's really at stake here,â€? Clinton said.\nShe would not directly respond to Trumpâ€™s latest nickname for her, â€œcrooked Hillary.â€?\nâ€œI am not going to be responding to all the crazy stuff he says,â€? Clinton said with a laugh.\nThe interview, which included questions from the audience, was postponed from last Friday because of what both ABC and the Clinton campaign said were scheduling conflicts.\nClinton had spent the morning the interview had been scheduled visiting a senior citizen center in East Harlem that primarily serves Latinos. She then left New York for a weekend of glitzy fundraisers in California that gave Sanders a prime opportunity to highlight her reliance on big donors. He had also taken time off the trail that day to fly to Rome for a Vatican conference on economic justice.\nOn Thursday, Clinton got questions about how she would draw in the young supporters who have flocked to Sanders if she is the nominee.\nâ€œI think it's terrific that so many young people are part of this process and I'm glad that I have a good base of support and I'm glad so many young people are supporting senator Sanders,â€? Clinton replied. â€œThey are involved. That has to be good news for the Democratic Party, good news for our country.\nâ€œI have said to groups of Sanders's supporters that they may not support me now, I totally understand that, but I support them,â€? she continued. â€œI will always work in a way that keeps their futures in mind because that's what I think you are supposed to do when you have responsibilities of public office, particularly being president.â€?\nAnne Gearan is a national politics correspondent for The Washington Post.\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\nNext week, the state of Pennsylvania will head to the polls to weigh in on the 2016 presidential nomination contests. The timing of that voting carries unusual weight, given that neither party has a candidate that's clinched a majority of the necessary delegates. (In 2012, Pennsylvania voted after Mitt Romney had already essentially won.) On the Republican side, in fact, Donald Trump is striving to hit the 1,237 mark before the convention, meaning he needs every delegate he can get.\nAnd yet Pennsylvania's votes may make almost no difference at all.\nTo understand why, it's worth digging into how the parties allocate their delegates. On the Republican side, states are left to their own devices, each coming up with a unique system for splitting up delegates by congressional district or statewide or both. Some delegates are bound to candidates, some get to vote for whoever they want. It ranges. On the Democratic side, there's one system: Proportional allocation. Winners of states (and congressional districts) get a number of delegates relative to how they fare in the voting.\nWhich is why Pennsylvania doesn't really matter for the Democrats. As it stands, Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by about 240 delegates (depending on how final delegate counts end up). There are 189 delegates at stake in Pennsylvania and another 95 in Maryland. Meaning that if Sanders won every delegate in those two states, he could close the gap.\nBecause of the proportional delegation, though, he'd have to win more than?85 percent of the vote in each state to do so. (A candidate needs to hit 15 percent to get any delegates -- a mark Clinton missed only in Vermont.) That sort of margin is not likely in any of the remaining states. Over the course of the campaign, Clinton has won 57 percent of the votes cast (according to U.S. Election Atlas ) to Sanders's 41, meaning that even if Sanders won, it would be a more modest win. If he won by 10 points in each state, for example, he'd end up winning about 156 delegates to Clinton's 128 -- a gain of 28 delegates. That's 12?percent of what he needs.\nAnd that's if he were to win! New polls in the states have Clinton leading by 13 points in Pennsylvania and 23 points in Maryland. In part, that's because both states have a lot of black voters, a demographic that's consistently voted heavily for Clinton. At those margins, though, Sanders is likely to actually lose a lot of ground against Clinton -- about 20 delegates' worth.\nThat same problem holds for the rest of the Democratic contests. Sanders has no reasonable path to winning the pledged delegates, and therefore no strong argument to make to the unbound superdelegates. Even if Sanders wins Pennsylvania by a small margin (which an adviser predicted he would), that doesn't change.\nOn the Republican side, the situation is very different.\nThere are 71 delegates up for grabs in the state. Trump has currently got 847 delegates committed to him -- 390 shy of what he wants to have in-hand by July. Those 71 delegates are almost a fifth of what he needs.\nBut those delegates are given out in two chunks. Whoever wins the state gets 17 of them -- and that appears as though it will be Trump, who has a big lead . The other 54 delegates, though? As we noted last month, they're unpledged. Meaning that once they get to the convention, they can vote for whoever they want.\nLast week, MSNBC's Steve Kornacki argued that this could be advantageous to Trump. Kornacki pointed to a survey of the people running to actually be those delegates conducted by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Many of them plan to vote for whoever wins their district -- indicating good news for Trump.\nBut they don't have to. Trump can't rely on those people voting for him, and once those delegates walk into the convention arena in Cleveland that serves as the temporary home of the Republican establishment, there will likely be a lot of pressure on them not to vote for him.\nIn other words, Trump can't count on those votes. And for a guy battling against the powers-that-be, that's a disadvantage.\nBack to our broader point: It also means that three-quarters of the Republican delegates from the state can do whatever they want, making next week's vote significantly less powerful.\nThis will provide lots of fodder for those (like Trump) who want to deride the system for nominating a president in each party, which is fair. But it's also worth noting that, as in New York, Pennsylvania's votes often don't do much to effect the outcome anyway.\nThe lesson is for outsiders. When results are announced in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night, be skeptical of people who insist that this tells us a lot about the future of the race.\nPhilip Bump writes about politics for The Fix.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\nBy Robert Costa and Philip Rucker April 21 at 7:17 PM Follow @costareports Follow @PhilipRucker\nHOLLYWOOD, Fla. ? As the Republican presidential race heads toward a possible contested convention, the three remaining candidates have begun considering vice-presidential picks ? with a much different set of calculations from a normal political year.\nSeparate but simultaneous vetting processes are underway. Advisers to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich said they are developing a list of prospects and researching their backgrounds. They are leaving open the possibility of announcing running mates as early as June, when primary voting concludes, or waiting until July at the Republican National Convention.\nFront-runner Donald Trump said he is giving the choice of a running mate serious thought, but his campaign is holding off on vetting candidates until the nomination battle is over. â€œI would not choose a vice president unless I know I have won,â€? Trump said in a recent interview.\nA contested convention in Cleveland would mean that instead of focusing on a running mate that would most improve their chances of swaying voters nationwide in November, the candidates may first consider whether someone will help them win over delegates.\nThe candidates must also game out the timing. Do they name someone ahead of the convention, as Ronald Reagan did with an unsuccessful result in 1976? Or do they wait until they get to the convention, when they could use the slot to appease potential supporters ? or even to entice one of their rivals onto a unity ticket?\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz greets supporters at a rally in Frederick, Md., on Thursday. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\nNone of the campaigns has an answer yet.\nâ€œThereâ€™s no magic formula this year,â€? veteran GOP strategist Ed Rollins said. â€œItâ€™s kind of like computer dating gone bad.â€?\n[ As Trump moves to soften his image, Democrats seek to harden it ]\nTrump, who said he wants to pick an experienced political leader, may calculate that he needs a bridge to mainstream Republicans who see his candidacy as radioactive.\nâ€œThere are two advantages: They can help you with the system, and the politicians have been vetted,â€? Trump said in the interview. â€œThatâ€™s the biggest advantage to a politician ? their whole life theyâ€™ve been vetted and you know everything, whereas if I pick some guy out of a great corporation who has done a job, you donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen.â€?\nRepublican officials were buzzing about the vice-presidential gamesmanship as they gathered here this week along the white-sand beaches of South Florida for a Republican National Committee meeting.\nCruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said Cruz instructed his top aides to begin a vetting process this spring. â€œYou need to be ready beforehand because you never know what youâ€™re going to need,â€? Roe said. â€œAnything can happen. But weâ€™re going through all the work that it takes.â€?\nOhio Gov. John Kasich wears a pair of boxing gloves at a town hall meeting in Annapolis, Md., on Tuesday. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\nThe Trump campaign is taking a different approach. Paul Manafort, Trumpâ€™s newly empowered top strategist, suggested the Cruz and Kasich campaigns should send their research dossiers to Trump Tower.\nâ€œThe other two campaigns have to [start the vetting process] because theyâ€™re not relevant, theyâ€™re not credible to be the nominee,â€? Manafort said. â€œThey have to do things that will make people assume theyâ€™ll be the nominee. Weâ€™re doing things that will make us the nominee.â€?\nBen Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who became a prominent Trump surrogate after dropping out of the GOP race in March, said it is imperative that Trumpâ€™s pick share the businessmanâ€™s worldview.\nâ€œItâ€™s about more than politics,â€? Carson said. â€œItâ€™s about the vice presidency, so that if something were to happen, that person could continue on and advocate for your policies.â€?\nCarson said he does not want to be considered and would not submit to vetting. â€œIâ€™ve already been vetted, more than anybody in the history of the world,â€? he chuckled, referring to his presidential bid. â€œBut, no, I donâ€™t want to be vice president.â€?\n[ John Kasich: â€˜My Republican Party doesnâ€™t like ideasâ€™ ]\nSeasoned Republicans are warning against selecting a running mate before the convention is gaveled in, arguing that for both political leverage and party unity the pick may need to be brokered at Quicken Loans Arena. This harks to an earlier time, such as 1940 and 1968, when GOP vice-presidential nominees were chosen at the convention to satisfy warring coalitions.\nâ€œWe may be returning to a long, bygone era where there will probably be little vetting because the nominee may need to pick someone at the convention, cutting a deal as they navigate the dynamics of the moment,â€? said Republican strategist Karl Rove.\nThe intense media environment of modern politics has spawned a more thorough, lawyerly vetting process, which is what the Cruz and Kasich campaigns have begun.\nIn the whirlwind atmosphere of a contested convention, there could be a temptation to throw a Hail Mary. But A.B. Culvahouse, a longtime Republican lawyer who oversaw the vetting for John McCainâ€™s 2008 selection of Sarah Palin, cautioned against sudden decisions. He said a vetting process should take at least six weeks.\nâ€œThe hardest thing about the vetting process is the tension between a time-consuming process and late-emerging political considerations where, for example, an adviser or pollster says if you pick this individual then you can win this state,â€? Culvahouse said.\nCruzâ€™s campaign is running its vetting in-house and is starting to scour public records, including campaign finance reports, speeches, online postings and social media. Some Cruz allies already are suggesting names, with one mentioning female senators such as Joni Ernst of Iowa and Deb Fischer of Nebraska.\nThe next step will be to ask potential candidates to participate in whatâ€™s known as a â€œfull vet,â€? including providing tax returns and medical records and answering a detailed questionnaire.\nCruz and his advisers are preparing for many contingencies. If, for example, Trump inches towards the 1,237-delegate threshold in June, Cruz could select a running mate to attempt to alter the psychology of the race.\n[ While the GOP worries about convention chaos, Trump pushes for â€˜showbizâ€™ feel ]\nSimilarly, Kasich instructed his top aides to begin a vetting process about two weeks ago, advisers said, and is approaching the project as an NFL team would approach a draft: preparing for numerous scenarios that might require different kinds of players.\nOne challenge for Kasich, however, is persuading people to submit to a full vet given the long odds he faces of becoming the nominee.\nâ€œIt would be tricky for anybody because theyâ€™re not agreeing to go on the ticket with the de-facto nominee, but with an open question about whether their running mate is going to be the nominee,â€? said Charlie Black, an experienced GOP consultant counseling Kasich on convention matters.\nTwo people likely to be on Kasichâ€™s short list are Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, according to one Kasich adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.\nRubio could be on other lists as well. Since mocking him as â€œLittle Marcoâ€? when they ran against each other, Trump suggested in a recent USA Today interview that Rubio, as well as Walker and Kasich, could have a place in his Cabinet.\nFormer Puerto Rico governor Luis Fortu?o, a Washington GOP establishment insider and Rubio supporter, said Rubio would complement Trump.\nâ€œI think Rubio would be a tremendous addition to any ticket,â€? Fortu?o said. â€œHeâ€™s still popular in Florida, he can communicate extremely well with the fiscally conservative base of the party and he can also do a great job with Hispanics.â€?\nRNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in an interview that an open convention could affect the timing of a vice-presidential nomination. He said he would be open to delaying formal proceedings to afford the presidential nominee time to negotiate or make a decision. Even with the prospect of a somewhat chaotic convention, Priebus said he doubted that the choice would be left to the delegates.\nâ€œI think that the nominee will choose the vice president,â€? Priebus said. â€œThe delegates will probably honor that choice.â€?\nFor Trump, the most appealing choices may be Rubio or Kasich because they bring delegates with them and have influence over the large, powerful delegations of their home states.\nâ€œYou could see Trump, if he were stuck at 1,180 delegates, going to Kasich,â€? said William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine.\nKristol drew a historical parallel to 1976, when Reagan made the stunning decision to tap Richard Schweiker, a moderate senator from Pennsylvania, before the Kansas City convention as a means of shaking up the race. Reagan lost the nomination fight to then-President Gerald Ford.\nBut first Trump would have to persuade Kasich to be considered. The Ohio governor has been adamant in his refusal to be a No.?2 in anyoneâ€™s administration, a sentiment one of his advisers reinforced Thursday.\nâ€œKasich
 will not participate in any vets,â€? the adviser said. â€œIf somebody wants to Google him, fine, but heâ€™s not participating under any circumstances.â€?\nRobert Costa is a national political reporter at The Washington Post.\nPhilip Rucker is a national political correspondent for The Washington Post, where he has reported since 2005.\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

The company cautioned in November it might bail on the marketplaces nationwide.\nThe UnitedHealth Group announcement and warning signs from other health insurers that Obamacare enrollees are costlier than expected serve as a reminder of how new and how fragile the health insurance exchange marketplaces are ahead of the open enrollment period for 2017 coverage, which begins this fall.\nUpon hearing the news, congressional Republicans vowed to work with Democrats to make whatever changes are necessary to make sure the law works well for everyone.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\nTHE MORNING PLUM:\nThereâ€™s a whole lot of hand-wringing among Democrats right now over Bernie Sandersâ€™s vow to keep on trying to flip super-delegates even if he continues to trail badly in the popular vote and pledged delegate count ? a quest that, he says, could spill on to the convention floor in Philadelphia in July. Both Sanders himself and his campaign manager Jeff Weaver have rattled this saber.\nBut now senior Sanders adviser Tad Devine has telegraphed a much more likely endgame ? one that would be a whole lot quieter and less contentious. In an interview with Rachel Maddow , Devine was asked whether this strategy is in sync with Sandersâ€™s high-minded campaign, and he answered, in part:\nâ€œThe key test is succeeding with voters. In 2008 I wrote a piece that they published in the New York Times right after Super Tuesday, and I argued that super-delegates should wait, should look and listen to what the voters do, and follow the will of the voters. And I can tell you, I got a lot of push-back from the Clinton campaign at the time, when I published that piece.\nâ€œBut I believe that today ? that our super-delegates, that our party leaders, should let the voters speak first. And I think if they do, all the way through the end of the voting, that will strengthen our party, and certainly strengthen our hand ? if we succeed with voters between now and June.â€?\nNote that â€œif.â€? In one sense, Devine is basically calling on Democrats to be patient and allow the voting to continue until the end. (Iâ€™ve argued that there are many good reasons for Sanders to keep going until all the votes have been counted.) But Devine is also clearly indicating that the super-delegates should not contradict the will of the voters, once theyâ€™ve all had a chance to speak.\nItâ€™s true, by the way, that Devine did argue this in a 2008 New York Times piece. Itâ€™s right here ! Devine wrote that super-delegates should â€œratify the results of the primaries and caucuses in all 50 states,â€? by supporting the â€œcandidate who has proved to be the strongest in the contest that matters,â€? which will be determined by â€œlistening to the voters.â€?\nNow, itâ€™s true that Devine did qualify his remarks later in the interview with Maddow, by saying that popular vote totals are potentially misleading in the sense that Sanders has won a lot of smaller caucus states, and noting that if Sanders comes very close in pledged delegates, it would be different than trailing among them by a large margin. But he also said this: â€œletâ€™s see whoâ€™s won the states, letâ€™s see whoâ€™s won the delegates, letâ€™s see where we are in June, and I think then weâ€™ll know what to do.â€?\nThatâ€™s basically a signal that once itâ€™s all over, the Sanders campaign will look at the aggregate will of the voters, as expressed by various metrics, and then re-assess how far to really go in trying to flip super-delegates. Is this in any way consistent with the suggestions from Sanders and Weaver that they will take this all the way to the convention? Maybe. It would be consistent with an endgame in which the Sanders campaign finishes in June trailing in the popular vote and pledged delegate count, makes one last pitch to super-delegates, finds that they are unwilling to switch, and then concedes and enters unity talks in which the two camps perhaps settle on some ways that Sanders can influence the convention proceedings and the partyâ€™s agenda in the fall campaign and beyond.\nI think thatâ€™s the most likely endgame . Of course, if Clinton does finish with sizable popular vote and pledged delegate leads, how this ends up winding down is all up to one person: Bernie Sanders.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addressed supporters at Penn State while voters cast ballots in New York's primary election. (AP)\n*************************************************************\n* BERNIEâ€™S SUPER-DELEGATE STRATEGY PUTS LEFT IN A BIND: Sandersâ€™s campaign has vowed that heâ€™ll try to win the nomination by flipping super-delegates, even if he trails in the pledged delegate count. But the Huffington Post reports that this creates a problem for liberal groups backing him, since they oppose having party insiders swing the nomination .\nAs a spokesman for MoveOn puts it: â€œSuper-delegates shouldnâ€™t overrule the will of the Democratic grassroots.â€? The Sanders camp is probably saying heâ€™ll do this just to keep his supporters engaged ? and sending money ? by persuading them thereâ€™s still a path for him.\n* CLINTON BACKERS NUDGE SANDERS OUT OF THE RACE: The New York Times reports that senior Democrats are now trying to figure out a way to wind down the primaries without doing too much damage to the party , with some Clinton backers prodding Sanders to exit:\nâ€œThere does come a point when Democrats, and those who believe we canâ€™t afford a Trump or Cruz presidency, should recognize that we need to start thinking about whatâ€™s best for the presumptive nominee going forward,â€? said Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Clinton supporter whose state holds its primary on Tuesday. â€œThe good news is that Bernie Sanders will remain in the Senate, where he can continue to speak out and continue to inspire new people into the process.â€?\nThe Clinton camp really needs to make sure her surrogates donâ€™t go too far with this.\n* SANDERS BACKERS DIVIDED OVER THE WAY FORWARD: The Los Angeles Times has a good report detailing how top backers of Sanders are divided over how aggressively to keep prosecuting the case against Hillary Clinton . Hereâ€™s Robert Reich:\nâ€œI want to urge Bernie supporters to tone down negative characterizations of Hillary and Hillary supporters to do the same with regard to Bernie. I know both candidates personally. Both are thoughtful and dedicated people who care deeply about this nation. Either of them would be a thousand times better president than any of the Republican candidatesâ€¦.Itâ€™s important that we not jeopardize that future joint effort through excessive divisiveness now.â€?\nWeâ€™ll know a lot more about where this is going when Sanders appears in Pennsylvania today.\n* WHY THE NEVER-TRUMP MOVEMENT MAY FAIL: Bloomberg Politics reports that after Trumpâ€™s big victory in New York, Never Trump Republicans face the reality that he may only be stoppe d after the nomination is taken from him at a contested convention, with him way up in delegates. And as GOP strategist Steve Schmidt says:\nâ€œTrust has completely collapsed in every every institution in America. And the notion that youâ€™re going to explain to voters in this environment that itâ€™s delegates ? and not voters ? who are going to pick the nominee is something that is going to be very, very difficult.â€?\nNeedless to say, Trump will do all he can to blast the proceedings as illegitimate, making it harder still.\n* HERE COMES THAT GOP ALTERNATIVE TO OBAMACARE!!! The Post reports that House GOP leaders are set to roll out an agenda that down-ticket Republicans can campaign on this fall . This, from Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, is fun:\nThe result, in McCarthyâ€™s telling, will be the most detailed set of policy plans released by House Republicans since retaking the majority more than five years ago.?The health care plan, for instance, will put forth the first leadership-endorsed plan to replace?the Affordable Care Act. Some?plans will take the form of actual draft legislation; other parts will?resemble â€œwhite papersâ€? detailing specific policies. While McCarthy said the agenda will be comprised of detailed proposals, there remains the question of exactly how specific they will be in areas that could be politically treacherous.\nSomething tells us that the plan for replacing the ACA will not end up being all that â€œspecific.â€?\n* STAKES SOAR FOR GLOBAL CLIMATE DEAL: This Friday, representative from 150 nations will formally sign the global climate accord reached in Paris. The Post reports that the recent drumbeat of bad climate news raises the stakes for the deal to work ? and to lead to more action :\nThe first three months of 2016 were the warmest on record in 136 years ? by large margins. The massive Greenland ice sheet has melted this spring to an extent that scientists?say theyâ€™ve never seen this?early.?New research suggested that if high levels of emissions continue unabated, sea levels could rise by nearly twice as much as expected by the end of this century. A global coral bleaching event fueled by warm seas is turning some once-majestic reefs into ghostly underwater graveyards.\n* AND WORLD LEADERS ARE TERRIFIED OF TRUMP: Politico reports that â€œforeign leadersâ€? are in a â€œfull boil panicâ€? about the success of Donald Trumpâ€™s candidacy :\nAccording to more than two dozen U.S. and foreign-government officials, Trump has become the starting point for what feels like every government-to-government interaction. In meetings, private dinners and phone calls, world leaders are urgently seeking explanations from Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Trade Representative Michael Froman on down. American ambassadors are asking for guidance from Washington about what theyâ€™re supposed to say.\nOf course those pointy-headed international elites are panicking. Trump is gonna knock their heads together and put an end to their fleecing of America. If anything, this will help him among GOP primary voters.\nGreg Sargent writes The Plum Line blog, a reported opinion

I was in the Senate at the time, so was Barack Obama. I voted against it. Barack Obama voted against it. Bernie Sanders voted for it.â€?\n? Hillary Clinton, campaign rally in Manhattan, April 18, 2016?\nClinton has repeatedly used Sandersâ€™s vote for a 2005 gun immunity law to draw a distinction between Sanders and herself on gun control.?Now, she is focusing on the consequences of the law on victims of gun violence, such as?the families of the 20 children and six adults killed at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. As the April 26 Connecticut primary approaches, Clinton likely will focus more on this issue.\nThe families are suing the Remington Arms Company,?manufacturer of the type of gun used in the shooting: the AR-15 rifle,?which is among the guns often?referred to as â€œassault weapons.â€? But the families are now having to use a complicated legal process in order to avoid restrictions in the gun immunity law, which Sanders supported and Clinton opposed. The debate has been further complicated by the fact that Sanders has given confusing statements as to whether Sandy Hook families have the right to sue the manufacturer.\nThis is a complex issue, but worth exploring. Is Clinton correct in citing?the immunity law for the challenges Sandy Hook families face to get their day in court?\nThe Facts\nCongress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) in 2005 in response to a wave of lawsuits filed against gun manufacturers starting in 2002, accusing them of creating â€œpublic nuisanceâ€? and not doing enough to ensure safe distribution of guns or prevent the flow of guns into illegal markets. Advocates for gun makers argued that law-abiding manufacturers should not be held liable for criminal actions of third-party individuals.\nThe law gave a unique federal legal shield that most consumer goods manufacturers do not have. The few industries that do have immunity are required to set up a compensation scheme for victims to recover money for damages ? but the gun industry is not subject to this requirement.\nSanders has defended his vote , saying gun sellers who follow the law shouldnâ€™t be held responsible for criminalsâ€™ actions. After Clintonâ€™s repeated attacks, Sanders has agreed to support repealing the law.\nIn recent weeks, Sanders gave conflicting responses over the law. In an April 1 interview with the New York Daily News, Sanders said gun violence victims should not be able to sue the manufacturer. (During the rally, Clinton was referring to what Sanders said during?this interview.)\nDaily News:?Thereâ€™s a case currently waiting to be ruled on in Connecticut. The victims of the Sandy Hook massacre are looking to have the right to sue for damages the manufacturers of the weapons. Do you think that that is something that should be expanded?\nSanders:?Do I think the victims of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer, is that your question?\nDaily News:?Correct.\nSanders:?No, I donâ€™t.\nThen, during the April 15 debate , he said: â€œThey are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today. They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.â€?\nWhen asked to clarify his stance in an April 17 CNN interview, Sanders appeared to play to both sides. He maintained that gun sellers shouldnâ€™t be held liable for third-party actions, but that he opposes assault weapons, similar to?the?AR-15 rifle. (More on his anti-assault weapons stance here .)\nOf course they have the right to sue. Anybody has the right to sue. And they just won an initial decision in their favor last week. But if you go into that discussion a little bit longer, do I end up believing that, if a gun store owner, a small gun store owner in rural Vermont or anyplace else, sells you a weapon legally, you come in with all the proper identification, you pass the instant background check, you legally purchase the gun, and you go out and you shoot somebody, that that small gun store owner should be held liable? No, I donâ€™t. I really donâ€™t.\nBut I have got to tell you also, on this issue of these assault weapons, letâ€™s be clear. â€¦ Those weapons should not be made available in the United States of America. So, in that sense, I agree with the Sandy Hook parents. But itâ€™s a question of how you go forward.\n(The victory that Sanders referred to in the debate and CNN interview is over whether the court has jurisdiction to hear the case. It doesnâ€™t address whether the case will move forward in court.)\nSandy Hook lawsuit\nThe law? has some narrow exceptions . The Sandy Hook plaintiffs are trying to use one of them: â€œnegligence entrustment,â€? which means that the manufacturer or seller knowingly supplied the product in a way that involved â€œunreasonable risk of physical injury to others.â€?\nShooter Adam Lanza used the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle (with a 30-round magazine), purchased legally by his mother. The AR-15 allows a person to rapidly shoot rounds of bullets without having to reload often, the lawsuit says. Itâ€™s the civilian version of the M-16, the Armyâ€™s standard issue rifle. The Bushmaster XM-15 would have been banned?under the proposed assault weapons ban of 2013 which failed in the Senate.\nThe military has strict rules for use and storage of M-16s and has a legitimate need to use such weapons for combat, but those rules and needs donâ€™t apply to non-military use of the gun, the lawsuit says .\nThey argue that the manufacturers knew, or should have known, that selling the gun for the civilian market would pose â€œan unreasonable and egregious riskâ€? of harm. Remington should have known the gun could be misused by a civilian, and that schools are particularly vulnerable to shootings, they say, yet it sold and marketed them as powerful guns capable of?â€œmilitary-style performanceâ€??anyway.\nItâ€™s a relatively new argument in this debate, legal experts said, and the court now has to decide whether it qualifies as an exception.\nItâ€™s a difficult argument to make for several reasons. For one, plaintiffs are trying to sue the manufacturer over the legal sale of a gun that did what it was supposed to do (shoot many bullets rapidly). The negligent entrustment exception applies when the seller knew that â€œthe person to whom the product is suppliedâ€? (i.e., Lanzaâ€™s mother) would cause harm. Further, large-capacity magazines arenâ€™t just limited to?AR-15-type rifles?and such rifles arenâ€™t the only guns used in mass shootings like Sandy Hook.\nGun immunity law\nThe fact that plaintiffs have to use this technical argument for their case to be heard?shows the impact of the law that Sanders voted for, the Clinton campaign said.\nGun manufacturers typically try to get the case thrown out based on jurisdiction. If this maneuver fails?(as in this case), the next step is to use the immunity law and argue that the case doesnâ€™t qualify as an exception, said?Adam Winkler, Second Amendment expert and constitutional law professor at University of California-Los Angeles. At that stage, gunmakers have been successful in getting such?cases dismissed, Winkler said.\n[Update: The Sanders campaign cited an article ?that reported that the court ruling over jurisdiction?allowed the families to sue. As we noted earlier, the ruling ?does not apply to whether the familiesâ€™ claim qualifies as a negligent entrustment exception.?The judge wrote that the defendant?was â€œnot challenging the legal sufficiency of the complaint," which must be done?through a separate legal procedure.]\nâ€œThink back to the tobacco litigation. The tobacco lawsuits werenâ€™t hard to bring, they were hard to win,â€? said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.\nThe landmark 1998 Tobacco?Master Settlement Agreement?was a?result of decades ? dating to the 1950s ? of failed litigation against Big Tobacco. It wasnâ€™t until Texasâ€™s 1996 lawsuit against Big Tobacco that the lawsuits had a chance. Thousands of incriminating internal memos were unearthed through the discovery process in court, showing tobacco companies knowingly tried to cover up the dangers of smoking.\nâ€œThatâ€™s one of the reasons why the PLCAA is seen as such an obstacle,â€? Vernick said. â€œIt prevents you from even going far enough to start the discovery process to get your day in court. Without the PLCAA, it might still be hard to win some of the cases, but at least you get a chance. And weâ€™ll see what happens with the Sandy Hook case.â€?\nThe Pinocchio Test\nClinton criticized Sandersâ€™s answer?during the Daily News interview, during which he said he does not believe?â€œvictims of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer.â€? He has since revised
 that answer, saying he agrees with the families that assault weapons (similar to?the AR-15) should not be made available. Still, he says?he believes gun shop owners who legally sell guns should not be held liable for a crime by a third party. But thatâ€™s not the question in the Sandy Hook case; the lawsuit is against the gun manufacturer for allowing the sale of AR-15 in the civilian market.\nThe Sandy Hook families are using a unique argument in their lawsuit, in an effort to qualify under a narrow exception to the immunity law.?They argue that by allowing civilians access to the gun, the manufacturer knew, or should have known, that it could be misused. Legal experts say itâ€™s a difficult case to make.\nThe immunity law can still be raised as a defense, and the court could decide that the claim doesnâ€™t qualify as an exception. It would prevent the lawsuit from going into the discovery process or going before a jury. Such lawsuits against manufacturers are already difficult to win, but the immunity law makes it difficult to even bring to court. Clinton correctly characterizes the lawâ€™s potential impact on the Sandy Hook lawsuit.\nThe Geppetto Checkmark\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\nHARTFORD, Conn.?? Hillary Clinton accused gunmakers and the gun lobby on Thursday of using their money and power to coerce members of Congress to do their bidding, as she promised to work for new gun-control measures if elected president.\n"We need a national movement," Clinton said at a community meeting in a YMCA here, drawing applause. "The gun lobby is the most powerful lobby in Washington," more so than Wall Street, big Pharma and more, she said, adding, "They have figured out how to really intimidate elected officials at all levels, who basically stop thinking about this problem because they are too scared of the NRA," the National Rifle Association.\nClinton cited the massacre of Connecticut schoolchildren four years ago as only one example of a gun culture gone too far. She tied some gun violence to difficulty getting mental health treatment for some who need it, and said gun-control activists are too often targeted for online harassment.\n"There has been a concerted effort to undermine the real-life experiences of people who speak out," Clinton said. "Blame the victim, blame the victim's mother , blame the victim's family, blame the victim's neighborhood," she said. "Find somebody to blame instead of saying ? you know what,?we've just got too many guns in this country."\nShe repeatedly promised to try to build on the Brady bill, which was passed during her husband's administration, and said the gun lobby has effectively blocked most gun-control efforts since then. She said?common-sense gun control can be achieved?without infringing on the Second Amendment and with the support of gun owners.\n"I am not here to make promises I can't keep," she said. "I'm looking for ways we can save lives. It is just too easy for people to reach for a gun."\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says Americans cannot become "indifferent" to daily gun violence in the United States, and that lasting solutions are needed to address the problem. (Reuters)\nClinton was introduced by Erica Smegielski, whose mother, Dawn Hochsprung, was the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School and was killed along with 20 children and five other staff members at the Newtown, Conn., school by a gunman in 2012.\nClinton's voice broke as she recounted how a?participant in a panel discussion at the?YMCA, Nelba Marquez-Greene, had given her the children's book that she and her 6-year-old daughter, Ana Grace, had been reading the night before she was killed at Sandy Hook. It was one of the country's worst mass shootings.\nAn emotional Clinton said Marquez-Greene asked her?to read the book to her own granddaughter, Charlotte. She was also visibly moved by the story told by an audience member, a local pastor, of beseeching God to save his son, fatally shot at 20 by another 20-year-old.\n"Let the congregation say, Amen," Clinton said when he finished.\nShe mentioned her Democratic presidential primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, only in passing. She noted that he had voted in favor of a law giving gunmakers unusual protection from lawsuits, while she had opposed it as a U.S. senator representing New York. She pledged to try to overturn that protection.\nAnne Gearan is a national politics correspondent for The Washington Post.\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in 2013. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nThe Boston Globe is reporting today that Hillary Clinton will consider putting another woman on the ticket as her vice presidential nominee this fall.\nThe first name on almost every Democrat's lips is Elizabeth Warren, the freshman Massachusetts senator who is beloved among liberals and regarded as the animating force behind the grass-roots energy that has propelled Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign against Clinton. Writes the Globe's Annie Linskey:\nWarren is one of the few Democratic women with national name recognition and a big following among progressives, a voting bloc Sanders has energized. Having Warren on the ticket could help Clinton stitch the party back together after a divisive primary.\nTrue. And also true that Democrats have surprisingly few women prominent enough nationally for Clinton to seriously consider them for the national ticket. Aside from Warren, the names you regularly hear are Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.). The Globe's James Pindell floats Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) and former Arizona governor Janet Napolitano, as well.\nWarren is clearly a first among equals in that group both for her fundraising prowess and her status as an icon of the liberal left. ?But, my strong sense is that Clinton and her inner circle will pick Warren only as a sort of last resort.\nHere's why. Warren hasn't endorsed Clinton in the presidential race, the only female Democratic senator in that position. â€œWhat Iâ€™m glad to see is whatâ€™s happening right now, and that is that?the Democrats are out talking about the issues,â€? Warren said in an interview with CBS in mid-March. â€œI think it makes it very distinct what happens between our side and whatâ€™s happening over on the other side.?Theyâ€™re doing some kind of reality show, weâ€™re out here trying to talk about the issues that affect the American people.â€?\nAnd, not only has Warren not embraced Clinton, she has been a thorn in the front-runner's side for much of the 2016 race. Her allegations that campaign contributions from the banking industry changed Clinton's mind about the need to overhaul bankruptcy laws became a talking point for Sanders during a debate earlier this year .\nWhat's been made obvious during the course of the Clinton-Sanders primary fight is that the electorate is split into Democrats who believe Wall Street needs to be closely watched and regulated but is not fundamentally evil and Democrats who believe Wall Street is corrupt through and through and must be treated as such. ?Clinton is on one side of this divide, Sanders and Warren are on the other. This passage, taken from Ryan Lizza's? terrific May 2015 profile of Warren in the New Yorke r, is telling:\nAs Lizza goes on to report, Clinton allies believe Warren's views on the economy ? and the real root causes of wage stagnation and income inequality ? are overly simplistic and reflect a lack of deep understanding of how the world actually works. "The challenge of wage stagnation is that itâ€™s happening in large swaths of the economy, many parts of which are relatively untouched by the influence of the banks,â€? one Clinton adviser told Lizza.\nWhen picking a vice presidential nominee, the single most important factor is chemistry. While some people were stunned by Obama's selection of Joe Biden as his vice president, it's become clear over the past seven years that the two men have a natural rapport and respect for one another that works for them. Ditto George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, although that relationship frayed and eventually tore over deep?disagreements over policy and approach.\nThere appears to be very little warmth between Clinton and Warren. Clinton views Warren as someone able to embrace a Manichean view of Wall Street (and the world) because she has the luxury of not needing to ever really deal with people who feel differently. (Massachusetts, particularly at the federal level, is effectively a one-party state.) Warren views Clinton in much the same light that Sanders has cast the former secretary of state in this campaign: prone to deal-making and insufficiently committed to core liberal principles.\nThat, typically, is not the foundation on which vice presidential nominees are built.\nThere is only one scenario I can see where Clinton picks Warren: If she feels as though she has to. How would that come about? If the rift with Sanders and the liberal left coalition he represents worsens over the course of the final six weeks of the presidential primary process and Clinton and her team believe that the only way to heal and unite the party before the general election is to go with the liberal hero as VP.\nAt this point, there's very little evidence that Clinton has that sort of major uprising on her left. In New York's primary on Tuesday , Sanders won voters who described themselves as "very liberal" by 12 points. But Clinton won those who said they were "somewhat liberal" by 18. In a March Post-ABC national poll , 77 percent of liberal Democrats said they would be satisfied with Clinton becoming the partyâ€™s nominee, 82 percent said they would be satisfied with Sanders.?Liberals may prefer Sanders, but they also like Clinton. And that almost certainly goes double if their choice in a general election is between Clinton and Donald Trump or Clinton and Ted Cruz.\nSeen through that lens, Warren is more of a specialized pick to fix a very particular problem ? which doesn't exist yet and likely won't ? than she is a true shortlister to be Clinton's vice president. Short of the "panic button" scenario I lay out above, I don't see Clinton even seriously considering Warren to be her second-in-command.\nChris Cillizza writes â€œThe Fix,â€? a politics blog for the Washington Post.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\nThis post has been updated.\nNew York's voter registration rules are fairly straightforward, with one big exception. The state doesn't allow same-day registration, but neither do many other states. The deadline to register to vote was in late March, a little under a month ago.\nThe primary vote has a higher bar. In order to vote in a party primary, you must be registered with that party before the prior general election -- in this case, last October. This early deadline was challenged in a case that made it to the Supreme Court in 1973, Rosario v. Rockefeller, but the court ruled on behalf of the state.\nThe October deadline is also the one that two of Donald Trump's kids apparently missed , meaning that they're unable to vote for their father on Tuesday. This was the best Eric could do:\nThank you Eric! https://t.co/pu1vDiQlrV\n? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2016\nThat deadline is also frustrating to independents who want to vote for other candidates -- for example, Bernie Sanders. Sanders has benefited far more from the support of independent voters in Democratic primaries than has Trump in the GOP primary. In nearly every state for which we have exit poll data, at least 30 percent of Sanders's total support has come from independents .\nEzra Koenig, lead singer of the band Vampire Weekend (which has done some gigs at Sanders events), tweeted about his frustration with the state's " voter suppression "?on Monday night. "Our choices are already limited by this two-party system, but an unaffiliated New York voter can't even watch a few debates and get to know the candidates before deciding to vote as a Democrat?" he wondered.\nThe answer is yes. Or, really: maybe.\nOn Monday, a group called Election Justice USA filed a lawsuit on behalf of a diverse group of New York voters against the state board of elections and its agents, asking that their clients be given the ability to vote as members of their preferred parties, that provisional ballots be counted alongside normal ballots and that the primaries be open to all voters, regardless of affiliation. There will apparently be a hearing on Tuesday afternoon -- well after voting is already underway -- to determine what should happen with the suit.\nThe three things isolated above aren't all of the requests made by the plaintiffs, but they each serve very different purposes that are worth fleshing out.\nThe first point addresses concerns from the plaintiffs that their attempts to register with a party on or before that late October date were ignored. Several are listed in the lawsuit by name. But it appears that the problem may be more widespread. A WNYC report found that the number of Democrats in Brooklyn -- one of the most populous counties in the state -- inexplicably dropped by about 126,000 . By "inexplicably," that's meant literally; WNYC's reporters tried to figure out what happened , to no avail.\nUPDATE: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a statement about the apparent voter purges on Tuesday evening. "I am calling on the Board of Election to reverse that purge," it reads in part, "and update the lists again using Central, not Brooklyn borough, Board of Election staff. We support the Comptrollerâ€™s audit and urge its completion well in advance of the June elections so corrective action can be taken. These errors today indicate that additional major reforms will be needed to the Board of Election and in the state law governing it."\nThis transitions to the next point, about provisional ballots. In some states, people who are denied the ability to vote but who think they should be allowed to are able to cast "provisional ballots" -- ballots that are considered for inclusion after the fact. The lawsuit, it seems, would demand that the state err on the side of assuming that provisional ballots be included. (Gothamist has a good look at this.)\nBloomberg's Jennifer Epstein points out that filing provisional ballots in the hopes they'll be counted is one strategy being employed by independents looking to cast a ballot for Sanders or Trump. It's almost certainly too late for a court to determine that independents can participate in the election without constraint, even if the court were so inclined. This, then, is as close as those voters may be able to get.\nNot for lack of trying. The Times reports that a 72-year-old showed up to vote for Trump in Chappaqua, only to be told he couldn't vote, since he wasn't registered as a Republican. "Nevertheless," the Times's Joseph Berge writes, "he planned to go to the Westchester County seat, White Plains, to straighten out the problem, then return to Chappaqua because he was determined to cast a vote for Mr. Trump."\nThe lawsuit notes that the 2016 election is exceptional in many ways. Exceptional interest, exceptional turnout, exceptional candidates. It's exceptional, too, in that New York's primary hasn't meant much in recent cycles. The question for the court, in part, is the extent to which the apparent changes in registration or purging of voter rolls is itself exceptional. Arizona's disastrous primary was clearly an exception. New York's may not be -- at least for New York.\nThis suit continues another pattern we've seen in 2016: questions being raised about the validity of election results. This, too, has been bipartisan. But so far, those myriad concerns have not resulted in actual changes to the outcomes. We'll know soon if New York is any different.\nUPDATE: The judge hearing the case declined to decide on the case on Tuesday, allowing the election to proceed as normal.\nPhilip Bump writes about politics for The Fix.

In fact, there is a lot of movement of superdelegates in these contests.â€?\n? Jeff Weaver, Sanders campaign manager, in an interview on MSNBC , May 2, 2016\nTo win the Democratic presidential nomination, a candidate needs a majority of the delegates to the convention. Most of the delegates ? 4,046 pledged to vote for the candidate ??are selected through primaries and caucuses. But there are also 719 â€œsuperdelegates,â€? who are elected officials, former elected officials and other eminence grises of the Democratic Party who can back whomever they want.\nHillary Clinton appears to be on track to win a majority of the pledged delegates. But because superdelegates make up 15 percent of the total delegate pool, neither Clinton nor Bernie Sanders ?can obtain the 2,382 delegates needed to clinch the nomination without the support of a good chunk of these superdelegates.\nSince any superdelegate can change their vote up until the convention, that gives the Sanders campaign hope that it can sway enough minds by July 25, when the convention begins, even if Sanders lags in the pledged delegate count.\nAn example of this theory appears in the statement by Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver. He pointed to the fact that 120 superdelegates switched from Clinton to Obama in the contested 2008 campaign?\nHow?accurate is this number?\nThe Facts\nThe Sanders campaign provided a list of 116 superdelegates that it said had switched from Clinton to Obama. The list did not include the date that a superdelegate switched, which made us instantly suspicious. (The list is embedded below.)\nClinton dropped out of the race on June 7, when she gave her â€œ18 million cracksâ€? speech . By any reasonable calculation, switches by superdelegates after she conceded the race shouldnâ€™t count.\nOn the Sanders list, one major oddity is that it includes 23 members of the New York congressional delegation. These lawmakers were among Clintonâ€™s earliest and strongest supporters in 2008, and they adamantly refused to switch as long as she remained?in the race. But on June 8, one day after Clinton dropped out, the entire New York congressional delegation collectively endorsed Obama .\nâ€œDammit to hell we fight,â€? explained Rep. Charles Rangel. â€œWhen itâ€™s over, we come together and go out there to win.â€?\nSo Rangel and the New York delegation considered the race to be â€œover,â€? but the Sanders campaign includes him and the rest of the delegation on a list of switchers.\nClinton also released her pledged delegates on Aug. 28, on the eve of the 2008 convention, meaning they were free to vote for anyone.\nIn a news article on Clinton releasing her delegates, then-New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine is quoted as saying the New Jersey delegation privately decided to switch to Obama in light of her decision to release her delegates. There are nine?members of the New Jersey congressional delegation on the Sanders list ? including Corzine.?â€œI think it is reflective of the unity that I sense that is building across the party,â€? Corzine?told USA Today.\nSo these were superdelegates who switched to Obama almost two months after Clinton dropped out of the race, when Clinton was encouraging everyone in the party to support Obama.\nThe best list we could find was maintained by the 2008 Superdelegate Transparency Project , which stopped counting switches on June 4.\nThis?list shows 29 people switched from Clinton to Obama, though one later switched back to Clinton. Thatâ€™s a total of 28. Some of these switches were undoubtedly noteworthy and symbolic, such as the announcement?by civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis of Georgia on Feb. 14. But 18, including former vice president Walter Mondale, switched after the last primaries in South Dakota and Montana ? and the same week Clinton dropped out. So itâ€™s really just 10?people during the primary?season.\nOddly, the Sanders list is missing some switchers, such as Mondale. But it includes New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who had never backed Clinton. He had sought the nomination and then later endorsed Obama .\nMoreover, itâ€™s important to recall that the gap between Obama and Clinton in superdelegates in 2008 was never as wide as the gap between Clinton and Sanders now.\nIn 2008, as of March 4, Obama had the support of 199 superdelegates and Clinton had 247. At that point in the race, Obama began to pull away from Clinton in terms of the number of pledged delegates he had won in primaries and caucuses.\nWhen Obama edged ahead with more pledged delegates, thatâ€™s also when Clintonâ€™s superdelegate count began to stall and Obama began to pick up more superdelegates. Most of these were not party officials who switched sides but people?who had been on the fence, waiting to see who appeared likely to win the nomination. (In fact, only six people switched sides before Obama had accumulated more superdelegates than Clinton.)\nBy the beginning of May, Obama had won the support of more superdelegates than?Clinton. By June, it had turned into a rout, with Obama attracting the support of 394.5 superdelegates and Clinton ending up with 280, according to a?New York Times graphic . Superdelegates who switched constituted only 7?percent of Obamaâ€™s superdelegate tally.\nBy contrast, according to the Associated Press , Clinton, as of May 4 this year, has 522 superdelegates compared to 39 for Sanders. Clinton is just 178 delegates short of victory, meaning far more than 116 superdelegates would need to switch from Clinton to Sanders to make a difference in the outcome.\nJust since March 31, Clinton has added 51 superdelegates, compared to eight for Sanders. She also has maintained a healthy lead of about 300?pledged delegates ? far more than what Obama ever achieved?during the tight 2008 contest. Indeed, senior Sanders adviser Tad Devine in early May? told our colleague Greg Sargent that unless Sanders does not â€œsignificantlyâ€? close the current pledged delegate gap with Clinton, it will be borderline â€œimpossibleâ€? to persuade superdelegates to switch from Clinton to Sanders.\nThe Pinocchio Test\nWeaver cast the 120 figure as happening â€œin the course of 2008â€? and said it demonstrated â€œa lot of movementâ€? in allegiance to the two candidates. But the record shows the opposite. Just 10?people switched from Clinton to Obama before the last primary votes were cast. The number grows to 28 if you include people who switched just before Clinton dropped out on June 7.\nBut itâ€™s highly misleading to count delegates who switched after Clinton dropped out of the race ? and she began to urge party unity behind Obama.

Dionne Jr. Opinion writer May 8 at 10:01 PM Follow @EJDionne\nThe first rule in elections is: Go for the votes you can get. By that measure, Hillary Clinton is right to try to put the old Obama coalition on steroids.\nDonald Trump will expand the Democratsâ€™ opportunities among nonwhite Americans and produce Clinton landslides among Latinos. These groups have good reason to fear and despise the man who has demeaned them.\nE.J. Dionne writes about politics in a twice-weekly column and on the PostPartisan blog. He is a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, a government professor at Georgetown University and a commentator on politics for National Public Radio, ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€? and MSNBC. He is the author of â€œWhy the Right Went Wrong." View Archive\nRSS\nAnd watch Republicans for Clinton become a major force in American politics, an alliance of mostly well-off, well-educated voters ? plus women of all classes. The members of the party of Lincoln who support Clinton will see that against Trump she is the safe and even, by the non-ideological definition of the term, conservative choice.\nBut Clinton also has to challenge Trump for at least a share among angry and struggling white, working-class voters with real economic grievances. Their votes matter if she wants to keep Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania in the Democratic column.\nClintonâ€™s visit to Appalachia last week reflected this realism, but it was about more than electoral calculation, because she is highly unlikely to carry either West Virginia (most Democrats think sheâ€™ll lose its primary on Tuesday to Bernie Sanders) or Kentucky this fall. Believe it or not, there are moral obligations in electoral politics. This is why her Appalachian outreach represented one of the admirable moments of her campaign. A progressivism that writes off the white working class is not worthy of being called progressive.\nHundreds of protesters braved torrential rains in the small coal mining town of Williamson, W. Va., during a campaign stop by Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Demonstrators accused the candidate of trying to end coal mining in the already struggling region. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\nTrump, of course, mocked her visit and reveled in the pushback she got from voters who are part of his base. She had to offer an apology for her statement this year that â€œweâ€™re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.â€?\nPolitically, it was not, to be charitable, a wise thing to say. But consider the context of that line, at a March CNN town hall :\nâ€œIâ€™m the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country. Because weâ€™re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right, Tim? And weâ€™re going to make it clear that we donâ€™t want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories.â€?\nThe media often donâ€™t put comments of this sort in context because, as you can see above, it takes a big fat, space-consuming paragraph to make it clear that she was speaking with empathy for coal miners, not consigning them to the economyâ€™s dustbin.\nAnd her speech last Tuesday in Athens, Ohio, offered un-glitzy, realistic policies to try to bring back an Appalachian economy that can no longer rely on coal. â€œAt a time when our energy sector is changing rapidly, we need to invest in coal communities,â€? she said. â€œWe need to figure out how to bring new jobs and industries to them, and we need to stand up to the coal executives trying to shirk their responsibilities to their workers and retirees.â€?\nNow contrast this with Trumpâ€™s speech in Charleston, W.Va., on Thursday. â€œWeâ€™re going to put the miners back to work,â€? Trump declared. â€œShe said, â€˜Iâ€™m going to put the miners and the mines out of business.â€™ â€?\nThe first part of that statement is a policy lie, but not the sort of lie that politicians typically get called on. The truth is that for a whole series of reasons (as thoughtful reporting over the years by the Louisville Courier-Journal has shown), the regionâ€™s old coal economy is not coming back to anything like where it was. In suggesting he can reverse these large economic trends, Trump is making a promise he cannot possibly keep. But a nice sound bite grabs more attention than Clintonâ€™s more complicated post-coal revitalization ideas.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump donned a hard hat at a rally in West Virginia on May 5. "For those miners, get ready because you're going to be working your asses off," under a Trump presidency, the candidate said to his cheering supporters in coal country. (Reuters)\nIn her speech, Clinton acknowledged several times that many of the voters she met with during her Appalachian tour would never vote for her. The trip nonetheless made sense as part of a larger obligation of leadership. Making America governable again requires breaking down barriers that get in the way of empathy across not only the lines of race and class but also of social status and personal values. And making America a more just nation requires honest talk about policies that can lift up those still hurting in our economy.\nThe hard political truth is that economic justice and empathy are the true alternatives to Trumpian divisiveness.\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Fahrenthold May 8 at 5:05 PM Follow @Fahrenthold\nHillary Clintonâ€™s official campaign platform is now twice as long as â€œHamletâ€?: seventy-three thousand six hundred forty-five words of policy ideas. One hundred seventy-four pages. And growing.\nBut, at its heart, this wordy list amounts to a statement of Clintonâ€™s confidence in two things.\nThe status quo.\nAnd the federal bureaucracy.\nThe other two candidates left in this presidential race want to overhaul American government. Clinton mainly wants to tinker with its parts. In many cases, her plans involve adding small ? but intricate ? new tasks for the bureaucracy, designed to make government smarter, more generous and more just.\nIn a May 8 interview with CBS Newsâ€™s â€œFace the Nation,â€? Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton explains what she means when she says Republican rival Donald Trump is a "loose cannon." (Reuters)\n[ The year of the hated: Clinton and Trump, two intensely disliked candidates, begin their face-off ]\nTo crack down on Wall Street, for instance, Clinton would expand a particular regulatory form. The form already is 42?pages long and can require up to 300 hours to fill out.\nIf Congress doesnâ€™t overhaul immigration, Clintonâ€™s plan is to allow undocumented residents to walk into local federal offices and ask for help. Already-busy bureaucrats ? armed with guidelines that nobody has written yet ? would make millions of new decisions about who can stay.\nThis approach says a lot about Clintonâ€™s worldview, after 23 years in and around Washington.\nTo her, complexity is realism.\nClinton says she simply canâ€™t make the simple, grand promises of her rivals ? free college tuition, a big, beautiful, free wall. Instead, she skips ahead to what policy looks like the way itâ€™s actually been done: complicated, ugly and in small steps.\nâ€œItâ€™s all incremental. Itâ€™s a lot of small ball,â€? said Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute. â€œBut itâ€™s incrementally increasing the size and cost of government. Itâ€™s all in one direction.â€?\nIf Clinton wins the Democratic nomination, this may turn out to be the perfect election to be a wonk ? because of who sheâ€™d be running against.\nIf Clinton treats policymaking like watchmaking ? a lot of whirring, tiny, hidden gears ? the Republican Partyâ€™s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, is a man making parade floats. His ideas are attention-grabbing. Expensive. And often discarded.\nLast week, Trump came out against his own plan to give huge tax cuts to the rich. He discarded his past opposition to raising the minimum wage. And he offhandedly suggested that the United States might pay back only a percentage of its debts, an idea that would rock the world economy and Americaâ€™s place in it.\n[ Trump, who once opposed minimum-wage hike, says he would â€˜like to see an increaseâ€™ ]\nâ€œI donâ€™t like either of them. But at least one of them is in the real world. And one has no bearing on reality,â€? Tanner said. â€œI simply believe Donald Trump is unqualified to be president. Hillaryâ€™s qualified. [And] I mean, I disagree with her on almost everything.â€?\nTo draw a full portrait of Clintonâ€™s ideas, The Post reviewed her campaign platform and her speeches, TV interviews and performances in the Democratic debates. In that platform, there are sweeping goals inherited from President Obama: immigration reform. Gun control. And there are a few abrupt shifts to the left, made during the race against Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\nPreviously, for instance, Clinton argued that the United States should continue deporting children who cross the U.S. border illegally, in order to â€œsend a messageâ€? that would discourage future migrations. But in March, after pressure by Sanders, Clinton gave. â€œI will not deport children,â€? she said in a debate.\nClinton has never adopted Sandersâ€™s basic vision of liberalism ? that the simplest way to help the needy is to help everyone at once.\nâ€œI also believe in affordable college, but I donâ€™t believe in free college,â€? Clinton said at a debate in February, attacking Sandersâ€™s simple, huge plan to make tuition free at public colleges. â€œWhat I want to do is make sure middle-class kids ? not Donald Trumpâ€™s kids ? get to be able to afford college.â€?\nClintonâ€™s solution for college is cheaper: $350?billion over 10?years, versus $750?billion for Sanders.\nBut itâ€™s not simple.\nClintonâ€™s plan is to determine what families can afford to pay, without borrowing, and provide the rest of the money as a grant. But that requires fine-grained bureaucratic determinations to find the right number for every family.\nShe also wants to help students by extending a tax credit that has a history going back to the tenure of her famously wonky husband. It can be worth up to $2,500. But only if students find their Form 1098-T, then fill out the relevant portions of Form 8863 , then enter the amount from lines 8 and 19 of Form 8863 in lines 68 and 50 of their Form 1040. Just like that.\nâ€œThereâ€™s some inevitable trade-off here between cost and simplicity,â€? said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. â€œPut me down for, â€˜Letâ€™s spend our scarce resources more carefully, even if it means more complexity.â€™ â€?\nBut that complexity sometimes backfires.\nIn this case, watchdogs say more than a quarter of those who deserve education credits donâ€™t bother applying. And the IRS paid more than $5.6?billion to people who applied for educational credits but ? upon later review ? may not have deserved them.\nThe pattern repeats.\nIn health care, Sanders wants to rip up the system, start over and make the government everyoneâ€™s insurer. Clinton wants to help in part by adding a tax credit to give families up to $5,000 to cover out-of-pocket payments.\nIn Appalachia, Sanders promises to undo the trade deals that he blames for killing factory jobs. Clintonâ€™s plans include extending a tax credit.\nThe credit, which already exists, would be tapered to spur new investment in areas that declined with coal. But it comes with just a little red tape.\nThe rules, for example, require a certified Community Development Entity to make a Qualified Low Income Community Investment in a Qualified Active Low Income Community Business. To get the money, a business must perform at least 50?percent of its business and have at least 40?percent of its tangible property within a designed Low Income Community. Also, by rule, the business canâ€™t be a racetrack, massage parlor, tanning salon or what the government calls a â€œhot tub facility.â€?\nBefore the credit expired the last time, a Senate study found it was so loopholed that ? in one instance ? it had been used to pay for a dolphin exhibit at the Atlanta aquarium.\nâ€œI do not believe, in totality, thatâ€™s enough,â€? said West Virginia State Rep. Clif Moore, a Democrat who represents the heart of coal country. â€œI donâ€™t think sheâ€™s offering anything thatâ€™s in and of itself brand new. She doesnâ€™t have the lightning rod.â€?\nClintonâ€™s approach is an extension of the one that both her husband and President Obama used to make change in the face of a balky Congress and hostile states. Instead of handing out money, they handed out tax benefits. Democrats could celebrate the benefit, Republicans the cut.\nInstead of simple, universal benefit programs, they engineered complex solutions ? like the Affordable Care Act ? that were supposed to be customized to fit consumersâ€™ needs.\nThe result, now, is a government that groans under the weight of its complexity.\nThe tax code has changed more than 4,000 times since 2004. The overwhelmed IRS expects to answer just 47?percent of the calls made to its help-line staff this year, and it has 923,000 unanswered letters. The broader growth of federal regulation has also caused a boom in the number of professional â€œcompliance officers,â€? whose entire job is to follow rules: There are 136,000 in the private sector, at last count.\nClintonâ€™s solutions would add complexity to complexity.\nThat, in a way, requires its own kind of faith: that bureaucrats can make the kind of fine-grained decisions necessary to keep such a detailed enterprise running. Her campaignâ€™s argument is that, in todayâ€™s Washington, thatâ€™s the only way to do it.\nSaid Jake Sullivan, a Clinton policy adviser: Clinton â€œwonâ€™t make promises that she canâ€™t keep or hide the details from the people whose vote sheâ€™s trying to earn.â€?\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(AP/Carolyn Kaster)\nSen. Bernie Sanders?has?proposed paying for his proposals to transform large sectors of the government and the economy?mainly through increased?taxes on wealthy Americans. A pair of new?studies published Monday suggests?Sanders would not?come up with enough money using this approach, and that the poor and the middle class?would have to pay more than Sanders has projected in order to?fund his ideas.\nThe studies, published jointly by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and the Urban Institute ?in Washington, concludes that Sanders's plans are short a total of more than?$18 trillion over a decade. His programs would cost the federal government?about $33 trillion over that period,?almost all of which would go toward Sanders's proposed system of?national health insurance. Yet the Democratic presidential candidate?has put forward just $15 trillion in new taxes, the authors concluded.\nIn principle, national health insurance could make many families better off overall, without imposing unsustainable burdens on the federal budget. For?the system to work in terms of dollars and cents, though,?the benefits would have to be less generous than they are in the system Sanders has proposed,?or the taxes would have to be more onerous for?the middle class, as they are in many European countries.\nJust hours before the third Democratic presidential primary debate, candidate Bernie Sanders released details about his proposed single-payer health-care plan. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\nIn the short term, at least, almost?every?household would be better off, as Sanders's proposals?for health care, secondary?education and more would save?ordinary Americans money and provide other valuable benefits.?The typical middle-class household, for example, would receive benefits worth $13,000 a year,?almost all of it for health care,?while paying just $4,500 more in taxes.\n[ Bernie Sanders is profoundly changing how millennials think about politics, polls show ]\nThose benefits would be especially meaningful for poor?households. The poorest 1?in 5?households would receive benefits worth about $10,000 a year on average, while paying just?$209 in additional taxes.?Among this group, there are many households with people who need?long-term care ? for example,?elderly women who have outlived their husbands and who are surviving on Social Security, and?those who are disabled and cannot work.\nThey would benefit enormously from Sanders's proposal to include pay for?long-term care through the federal government, which accounts for about 13 percent of the benefits the poorest 1?in 5?households?would receive.?In total, Sanders's proposals?would effectively quadruple?the incomes of this group?on average.\nThe benefits would exceed?the increased taxes for all but the richest 1?in 20 families. Even for the next richest 20th of the population, the new benefits would exceed their increased taxes by about $1,700 on average, or 0.9 percent of their?average income.\nOver time, though, the government would have to borrow?money to fund the programs, potentially increasing interest rates with uncertain consequences for households and?businesses.\nThe new estimate of the cost of Sanders's health-care plan is even more pessimistic than?a previous estimate produced by Kenneth Thorpe, a former health official in the Clinton administration.?Sanders's staff criticized Thorpe for predicting their plan would cost $25 trillion over a decade, about twice what they had projected. The Urban Institute?puts the cost to the federal government at?$32 trillion.\nThat is $17 trillion more than Sanders has proposed in new taxes. When his other programs besides health care are included, the shortfall?is more than $18 trillion, money the government would have to borrow.\nWarren Gunnels, Sanders's policy director, disputed the findings in a statement, saying?a national health insurance system would be more efficient.\n"This study significantly underestimates the savings in administration, paperwork, and prescription drug prices that every major country on earth has successfully achieved by adopting a universal health care program," he wrote.\n"The fact of the matter is that the U.S. spends far more per capita on health care with worse health outcomes than any major country on earth. And unlike every major country on earth over 28 million of our people are still uninsured," Gunnels added. "If every other major country can spend less on health care and insure all of their people, so can the U.S."\nEconomists would generally?view Sanders's proposals?"as basically hurting the economy, potentially significantly," Leonard Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, told reporters. "It pushes up the cost of borrowing for businesses. It makes it harder for people to buy their own homes."\n[ Death predicts whether people vote for Donald Trump ]\nBurman added that?it might be impossible to get the money for Sanders's plans?by?further increasing taxes on the rich, who would already?pay steep rates under?the plans?the senator from Vermont has advocated.\nThese households have substantial wealth that supporters of Sanders's ideas might want to use toward funding his ideas. Yet?they?might respond to?additional?increases in taxes beyond what Sanders?has proposed by, say, investing less or retiring early, producing less income for the government to tax.\nHouseholds with more than $10 million a year?would pay a marginal rate of 54.2 percent on additional?income under Sanders's proposals.?Among?the richest 1?in 100 households, the?marginal tax rates?on capital gains would reach? nearly?60 percent , the Tax Policy Center previously concluded, depending on the type of investment.\n"Those rates have to be close to the highest levels they could be assessed without starting to lose revenue,"?Burman said.\nSanders propose raising more in?taxes from the middle class. Given the value of the?benefits they would be?receiving, doing so?could still leave them in the black?on paper.\n"It's likely, given how large the benefits are for many people, that they would still be better off on net," Burman said.\nOn the whole, Sanders's plan would require more in new taxes than Americans?currently spend on?health care.?Sanders's goal is to offer national health insurance that is more generous than many Americans' current?policies,?and to extend insurance?include the roughly 28 million people who are still uninsured, according to the Urban Institute.\nMore from Wonkblog:\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.): â€œTrump was not my first, second, or third choice. I object to much in his manner and his policies. His vulgarity, particularly toward women, is appalling. His lack of appreciation for Constitutional limits on executive powers is deeply concerning. I disagree with his proposals to ban Muslims, to give government more eminent domain powers, to be neutral between Israel and its enemies, and several others. In short, I find his candidacy highly problematic.â€?\nTime to take cover. â€œIn a new sign of the Republican Partyâ€™s reservations about Mr. Trump, the top strategist in charge of defending Republican control of the Senate said in a briefing for lobbyists and donors on Thursday that the partyâ€™s candidates should feel free to skip the nominating convention in Cleveland in July.â€? This is extraordinary, unprecedented.\nTime for a change. â€œFacing low oil prices and diminishing foreign-exchange reserves, Saudi Arabiaâ€™s King Salman has shuffled top policy makers, including his long-serving oil minister and central-bank governor.?The sweeping changes announced Saturday coincide with a plan to reduce Saudi Arabiaâ€™s dependence on oil and boost foreign investment, as well as other sources of revenue such as tourism.â€?\nTime ?to face facts. â€œConservatives who believe that Clinton and Trump are both genuinely unfit to be president can work to get a principled third-party candidate on the November ballot. Donald Trump is toxic enough among independents that he would most likely lose the election even if conservatives did support him. But by rejecting the Clinton-Trump choice conservatives would at least send a message to the Republican party and the country about the limits of what they will tolerate in a presidential candidate.?They would also get to keep their dignity. Thatâ€™s no small thing.â€?\nTime ?to admit just what a nightmare he is. â€œWith Donald Trump on the brink of receiving classified security briefings from the Central Intelligence Agency, U.S. foreign policy figures of both parties are raising concerns about a close Trump aideâ€™s ties to allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin.?Trumpâ€™s top adviser, Paul Manafort, has spent much of his recent career working for pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, and doing complex deals for an oligarch with close ties to Putin.â€? Trump shouldnâ€™t get the briefing as?long as Manafort works for him. Period.\nTime for straight talk. â€œOver and above specific issues, Trump is a greater menace to freedom than Hillary Clinton because his ascendancy threatens to?Europeanize American politics by transforming the GOP into a a US version of neo-Fascist European parties, such as Franceâ€™s National Front, whose policies are very similar to Trumpism.â€?\nTime for Trumpkins to fess up: He stands for nothing. â€œU.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Sunday he is open to raising taxes on wealthy Americans, backing off his prior proposal to reduce taxes on all Americans.â€?

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\nWhen Donald Trump told ABC's George Stephanopoulos in an interview on Sunday that he didn't think the Republican Party needed to be unified behind his candidacy, it wasn't really clear what he meant.\n"Does [the party] have to be unified? I'm very different than everybody else, perhaps, that's ever run for office. I actually don't think so," Trump said. "I think it would be better if it were unified, I think it would be -- there would be something good about it. But I don't think it actually has to be unified in the traditional sense."\nSo how will he win? "I think I'm going to go out and I'm going to get millions of people from the Democrats," Trump said. "I'm going to get Bernie [Sanders] people to vote, because they like me on trade."\nThe Fix breaks down the 10 Republicans who have been most vocally opposed to Trump's nomination. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\nA charitable interpretation is that Trump doesn't think members of the Republican establishment need to align behind him in order for him to be successful. That was certainly true in the primaries, but it's less clear that it's true in the general. Why? For the same reason that the uncharitable interpretation of Trump's comments is so baffling: Trump very much needs Republicans to vote for him in November.\nThat sounds obvious, of course, but it's worth delving?into. Consider, for example the relative unfavorability of Trump and Hillary Clinton within their own parties. Clinton's got the Democratic nomination essentially locked up, but is still battling Bernie Sanders and still maintaining only a small lead over him in national polling. But she is much more positively viewed by members of her own party than is Trump -- and consistently so. Trump's numbers have improved, but they're still pretty abysmal.\nThis is a large part of the reason that Trump's overall favorability ratings are lower than Clinton's: Republicans look at him a lot more skeptically than Democrats do Clinton. For him to be successful in November, he needs those skeptical Republicans to come out and vote for him anyway.\nAfter all, this happens at a time when partisans have been more willing than ever to vote for the candidate their own party nominated. Even independents -- a group that largely still tends to vote on a partisan basis -- were largely loyal to the party with which they identified in 2008.\nIf Republicans waver on their choice but Democrats stay true to their party, Trump's in a lot of trouble. (Yes, a chunk of Bernie Sanders supporters say that they won't back Clinton in November, but when Clinton lost the nomination in 2008, the number of defections was much smaller than polling at the end of the primary suggested.)\nDonald Trump will end the primary season with? more votes from Republicans than any Republican in history. But he's also had the most people vote against him , as the splintered party struggled to reach consensus. The fact that prominent Republicans are reluctant to back Trump is a both a cause and side effect of that split. House Speaker Paul Ryan declining to endorse Trump won't hurt Trump among Trump's existing base of support; they don't like Ryan anyway. But if Ryan argued for Trump's candidacy -- if more moderate/establishment Republicans were to embrace and make the case for his nomination -- it's likely that wavering Republicans might be influenced. Trump needs them to be.\nHe waves this away by suggesting he'll find some space in the political middle. He returns to this baffling idea that he can lure Bernie Sanders's supporters to his cause -- an effort that will almost certainly fail based on the politics at play and an effort about which Sanders himself has been increasingly vocal .\nThere has been a repeated suggestion that Trump can lure Democrats to his cause in the way that Ronald Reagan did in 1980. (You can see the dip Reagan caused in Democratic Party loyalty on the first graph above.) But that idea is flawed for several reasons.\nFirst of all, those Reagan Democrats -- mostly working-class white males -- have already migrated to the Republican Party. You can see the trend in data from the General Social Survey; the Reagan Democrats of 1980 are the regular-old Republicans of today. In that sense, Trump is right: His campaign hinges on those voters supporting him.\nOn top of that, though, white voters are a much smaller part of the electorate than they were in 1980. That year, 88 percent of the electorate was white. In 2012, the figure was 72 percent. In 1988, working-class whites made up half of the electorate, as the Atlantic's Peter Beinart noted in March. This year, they'll be only one-third. Yes, it's possible that Trump will inspire more whites to come to the polls, but there's also some evidence that he's inspiring nonwhites to turn out, too -- to vote against him.\nTrump can't count on wooing a large group of Democrats to vote for him in part because most of the Democratic Party is made up of groups that view him very negatively: women, blacks, Hispanics. If he can't convince Democrats, and if Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents maintain their party loyalty, he needs every Republican vote he can get. To do that, he needs help -- the sort of help he didn't get in the primaries, leading to his earning less than 50 percent of the total votes.\nIt sounds macho to say he doesn't need loyalty, that he'll go it alone, with the party or without it. But a non-unified Republican Party is a Republican Party that endures four more years of a Democratic White House.\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

We need to talk the state of play within your own party, but you have commanded a different headline that needs to be addressed. You are attacking Hillary Clinton for the sexual past and indiscretions of her husband, calling her an enabler. We have a panel of independent voters. They are smart as heck, and most of them don't like it. They see it as a distraction. They see it as hypocritical coming from you, and they mostly see it as potential proof that you may have no real ideas to offer as president. What is your thinking on this line of attack?\nTRUMP: Well, this is a nice way to start off the interview. First of all, you should congratulate me for having won the race. I thought, you know, at least there would be a small congratulations, but I'm not surprised with CNN because that's the way they treat Trump. It's the, you know, they call it the Clinton Network, and I believe that. So, you know ...\nCUOMO: Wait. Hold on. Mr. Trump, I did congratulate you the last time we spoke. I said, "Congratulations on winning the big race."\nTRUMP: Thank you very much. So warm and so well-felt.\nCUOMO: No, no, no. Hold on. Let's get this off on the right foot. I'm trying ...\nTRUMP: You're starting off with a question. We haven't spoken. Last week, towards the end, I was the?? essentially the nominee of the party, and you start off with this question, which is not surprising because?? I understand CNN perhaps a lot better than you do.\nCUOMO: Okay, okay. Let's?? you know what? You're right. Sometimes it's good to restart. Here's the restart. You are going to be your party's nominee, by all accounts. You are going to carry the standard for this party. You have said that once you get into the general, people will see what you have to offer. The first thing you've come out with, hot and heavy out of the box, are these attacks on Hillary Clinton.\nCuomoâ€™s question referred to an anti-Clinton tirade Trump launched during a rally in Eugene, Ore., on Friday; he called the former secretary of state an â€œunbelievably nasty, mean enablerâ€? of marital infidelity by her husband, former president Bill Clinton. The CNN voter panel presumably found Trumpâ€™s attack hypocritical because he has admitted to ? and even bragged about ? infidelity of his own.\nTrump previously had said,?in an NBC News interview just a couple days earlier, that he wouldnâ€™t bring up Bill Clintonâ€™s sexual history again ? as he did earlier in the primary season ? unless he felt Hillary Clinton was treating him unfairly.\nSo there are two reasons why Trump should have to explain his â€œthinking on this line of attack,â€? as Cuomo put it. But the real estate mogul fired back with two reasons why he shouldnâ€™t: Cuomo didnâ€™t congratulate him on dispatching Ted Cruz and effectively clinching the GOP nomination six days earlier, and besides â€œthey call [CNN] the Clinton Network.â€?\nBy â€œthey,â€? Trump apparently means some people (many of whom appear to be Bernie Sanders supporters) on Twitter:\n@CNN of course ur spinning @SenSanders win tonight.NEWSFLASH- General election are Independents! #ClintonNetwork at it again. #BernieOrBust\nRemember when CNN interviewed the Ohio Trump attacker?\nCNN is the most disgraceful channel of all #ClintonNetwork\n? Puya Fiel (@PuyaFiel) May 3, 2016\nHow is this just?! Just when @BernieSanders mentions @HillaryClinton transcripts, @CNN goes to break. #clintonnetwork\nDuring Bill Clinton's presidency, conservatives like Tom Delay used to joke that CNN stood for Clinton News Network .\nNone of this has anything to do with the issue at hand?? or any real campaign issue at all, for that matter. But it's yet another example of Trump's ability to deflect questions he doesn't want to answer and put the media on the defensive. He can find a slight or a sign of unfair treatment in almost anything.\nThere's another lesson here, too: If you run into Trump on Jan. 7, be sure to wish him Happy New Year. Six days after the fact, he still expects the courtesy.\nDonald Trump told supporters in Spokane, Washington on Saturday, May 7 that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was an "enabler" for what he said was her husband, President Bill Clinton's, mistreatment of women.

Thiessen May 9 at 10:34 AM Follow @marcthiessen\nDonald Trump lashed out at House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) for saying he is not ready to support him, but it is not Ryan that Trump needs to worry about. Rather, itâ€™s the majority of Republican voters who did not vote for Trump ? and may not do so come November.\nTrump won just 40.2 percent of all votes cast in the GOP primaries, the lowest percentage of any Republican nominee since Richard Nixon in 1968. Except for Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), no Republican presidential nominee in nearly five decades has failed to win a clear majority of GOP primary votes.\nMarc Thiessen writes a weekly column for The Post on foreign and domestic policy and contributes to the PostPartisan blog. He is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and the former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush. View Archive\nRSS\nTrump brags that he is on track to break the GOP record for the largest number of total primary votes of any GOP presidential nominee in modern history ? about 10.7 million so far. But he has also set another record: the most Republican primary votes against his candidacy ? 15.9 million ? of any GOP presidential nominee in modern history. Almost 60 percent of GOP voters wanted someone else to be their nominee.\nRight now, Trump faces an uphill climb to win over those voters. A recent USA Today/Suffolk University poll shows that 4 in 10 Republicans arenâ€™t sure whether they will vote for Trump in November. Among the majority of GOP voters who cast ballots for other candidates, 25 percent say they will seriously consider a third-party candidate and 19 percent may vote for Hillary Clinton, while 18 percent may stay home.\nTrump also has a big problem with Republican women. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in March found 47 percent of Republican women primary voters said they couldnâ€™t imagine voting for Trump in November.\nIf Trump does not change the minds of these Republicans, he is going to lose to Hillary Clinton.\nTrump said this weekend he does not believe the Republican Party needs to unify behind him in order for him to ascend to the White House. Heâ€™s wrong. Right now, Trump has just 5 percent support among Democrats ? thatâ€™s less than Mitt Romney, who won 7 percent of Democrats and 93 percent of Republicans in 2012 and still failed to win the presidency. Trumpâ€™s protectionist trade message and his attacks on China and Mexico may boost his numbers among Democrats somewhat, but there just arenâ€™t enough disaffected white male Democrats to make up the difference if he does not consolidate his conservative base. Without Republicans united behind his candidacy, he has no chance.\nRyan spoke for millions of Republicans when he said that, while he wants to support Trump, heâ€™s â€œnot there right nowâ€? because he is unsure where Trump stands on â€œour principles of limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution.â€? There is good reason to be concerned. Only days after locking up the nomination, Trump is already backtracking on conservative positions he staked out during the primaries.\nFor example, Trump won a lot of praise from conservatives in September when he rolled out his tax plan. Stephen Moore, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, called it â€œReaganesque,â€? adding â€œWho would have known Donald Trump was a supply-sider?â€? Now, Trump is backing away from his plan, declaring that heâ€™s â€œnot necessarily a huge fanâ€? of all of its elements and that it is merely a starting point for negotiations because â€œDemocrats and everybody else, theyâ€™re going to come to me. Theyâ€™re going to want to negotiate.â€?\nSo the master of the â€œart of the dealâ€? is making concessions before negotiations even begin? Is that what they teach at Trump University?\nTrump also flip-flopped on the minimum wage. During the fall campaign, Trump said, â€œWe have to leave [the minimum wage] the way it isâ€? because â€œwe have to become competitive with the world.â€? But when asked about a minimum wage increase this week, he said â€œI would like to see an increase of some magnitude.â€? Asked whether he was changing positions, Trump scoffed: â€œSure, itâ€™s a change. Iâ€™m allowed to change. You need flexibility.â€?\nConservatives look at this and ask themselves: Whatâ€™s next? Abortion? His promise to increase defense spending? Naming a conservative to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court? Will he stick by any of his campaign pledges, or is every conservative position Trump has taken negotiable?\nThe Fix breaks down the 10 Republicans who have been most vocally opposed to Trump's nomination. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\nTrump said this weekend, â€œIâ€™m a conservative, but donâ€™t forget, this is called the Republican Party. Itâ€™s not called the Conservative Party.â€? That should set off alarm bells for the partyâ€™s conservative majority.\nTrump may not care whether Ryan endorses him, but he does need to worry about the millions of Republicans who share the speakerâ€™s concerns about Trumpâ€™s conservative bona fides. There are a lot of conservatives who, like Ryan, are â€œnot there yetâ€? when it comes to backing Trump. And if Trump does not get them there, he wonâ€™t get to the White House ? and then he wonâ€™t have to worry about offering concessions to Democrats next year.\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

He has been everywhere, often seen sitting with his eyes narrowed across from a cable host, at other times just a voice.\nBut the saturation has been more than a victory tour for Trump. It is?indicative of how he plans to approach the general-election campaign. Instead of relying on traditional methods of communication ? paid advertising, carefully-chosen interviews, corporate-crafted Facebook posts ? he will be the medium and the message, unpredictable and always around.\nTrumpâ€™s daily routine: hundreds of requests come in through his trusted press aide, Hope Hicks, and they get piled on his desk. (Trump likes to review actual printed documents.) He rifles through them ? confirming this, nixing that. But that isnâ€™t the end. He surveys?cable news, he monitors the headlines (which are also printed out). Heâ€™ll call into one network while another sets up backstage. And eventually he turns to Twitter, typing himself or dictating to an associate.\nFor Democrats and Republicans, the obvious consequence of Trumpâ€™s ubiquity is that regardless of what they want to focus on, they will likely be forced to respond each day to the mogulâ€™s latest whim. He looms each hour as a constant potential disturbance, for better or for worse.\nAnd shock he did on Thursday when he generated a torrent of commentary ? much of it cringing and harshly critical ? with a controversial tweet that showed him smiling widely as he ate a taco bowl and praised Hispanics.\n?\nHappy #CincoDeMayo !

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2016\nTo get a sense of why Trump is following an unusual playbook all his own, The Washington Post spoke with longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone, a Nixon-loving bon vivant and ruthless strategist who has been at the billionaireâ€™s side for decades (although he is not part of Trumpâ€™s campaign).\nStone said that Trumpâ€™s manner, forged in the Manhattan tabloid and business wars of the 1980s, could weather more blows and brushbacks than the typical national politician and thus made the candidate more willing and able to use his persona as his most prominent campaign tool.\nâ€œTrump is going to eschew everything the establishment and the press think he should be doing to have a total grassroots communications strategy,â€? Stone said in the interview. â€œHeâ€™ll be all over the media, doing as many interviews as he can, calling into radio shows, and having wall-to-wall rallies that get broadcast on the cable channels.â€?\nâ€œRemember,â€? he added, â€œthose rallies also get you to dominate the local news. So youâ€™re all over the local channels, all over the national, wall-to-wall and free.â€?\nStone didnâ€™t always agree with Trumpâ€™s tactics.\nâ€œI told him it couldnâ€™t work. I was skeptical. An adviser telling someone that you could win a presidential campaign by not spending much at all on ads? By simply going on TV? It was a historic calculation,â€? he said.\nâ€œBut he did it.

Puskar, File)\nA new report offers evidence former football coach Joe Paterno might have heard sex abuse allegations against Jerry Sandusky as early as 1976. From Gabe Hiatt : â€œDescribed as â€˜a new bombshellâ€™ in the Sandusky saga, the report references a court order on a related insurance coverage case involving the more than $60 million the university has paid out in civil claims filed by victims of Sanduskyâ€™s child molesting crimes. According to PennLive, the court order contains claims by one of Penn Stateâ€™s insurers that â€˜in 1976, a child allegedly reported to â€¦ [Joe Paterno] that he â€¦ was sexually molested by Sandusky.â€™ â€˜The order also cites separate references in 1987 and 1988 in which unnamed assistant coaches witnessed inappropriate contact between Sandusky and unidentified children, and a 1988 case that was supposedly referred to Penn Stateâ€™s athletic director at the timeâ€™ â€¦ All of these examples were taken from victimsâ€™ depositions used in the still-pending insurance case.â€?\nPenn State told NBC News it was aware of the allegations, â€œbut the legal case and confidentiality commitments that govern our settlement agreements preclude us from discussing these matters at all.â€?\nGET SMART FAST:??\nThe seventh Workerâ€™s Party Congress began in North Korea behind closed doors, with a requirement that foreign reporters stand 500 yards from the building.

(Reuters/Yuri Gripas)\nThe House speaker -- and not incidentally, the chair of the GOP's convention in Cleveland this summer -- went on CNN yesterday
 afternoon and said he's "not ready" to back Trump, who has all but formally wrapped up?the nomination. By holding out, Ryan -- the target of pleas to put his own name in presidential contention (no dice, he says) -- gave down-ballot Republicans cover to separate themselves from the business mogul if it benefits them. But it was yet another extraordinary moment in what has been a wildly unpredictable race.\nPhilip Rucker, Paul Kane and Robert Costa ?have the story: â€œWhile acknowledging that Trump has mobilized a powerful grass-roots movement and earned the nomination, Ryan said that Trump has not shown himself to be â€˜a standard-bearer who bears our standardâ€™ ? and he put the onus on the business mogul to recalibrate his campaign and offer a more inclusive vision.â€? Asked by CNNâ€™s Jake Tapper whether he backs Trump, Ryan said â€œIâ€™m just not ready to do that at this point. Iâ€™m not there right now.â€? (In response, Trump said he is â€œnot ready to support Speaker Ryanâ€™s agendaâ€¦â€?) ?\nRyanâ€™s comments deepened the divide in a party now facing a painful reckoning about Trump: His remarks broke a previous pledge to support the GOP nominee, and put him at odds with both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who recently backed the real-estate mogul.\nHis remarks offer a new way for like-minded Republicans to address Trumpâ€™s pending nomination: "'There has been growing anxiety among members in purple and blue districts, marginal seats,' said Rep. Peter T. King ?... 'Paul truly believes what heâ€™s saying...Itâ€™s personal and sincere. But there is a political equation to all this. He knows what the feeling is inside of the House as much as anyone.'â€?\n--â€œTrump is expected to visit Washington next week to meet with lawmakers. But there are no plans for Trump to address the full House Republican Conference ? a departure from tradition for both parties, in which the presumptive nominees trek to Capitol Hill to meet with their respective caucuses in meetings hosted by the congressional leadership.â€?\nMeanwhile, the RNC is working to set up a meeting between Trump and Ryan next week, and Chris Christie said he would try to reach out to Ryan and discuss his concerns.\n--â€œThe tensions between Trump and Ryan go beyond temperament. They have philosophical differences about the size and scope of government â€¦ Ryan champions free-trade agreements, international military engagement, and sweeping overhauls of Social Security and Medicare, whereas Trump is an avowed opponent of recent trade deals, foreign interventions and proposed changes to entitlement programs.â€?\n?\nKasich aide John Weaver praised the speaker for his stand:\nSuch respect for @SpeakerRyan . Wish more @GOP leaders had his courage.\n? John Weaver (@JWGOP) May 5, 2016\n--"Trump will soon be getting briefings from U.S. spy agencies. It might not go well," reports? Greg Miller : Trump said he is eager to start meeting with U.S. intelligence officials "for classified briefings on the nation's secrets. The feeling may not be mutual?â€¦ is not known for discretion or nuanced understanding of global security issues, let alone awareness of the widespread revulsion among U.S. intelligence officials over some of Trump's positions ? including his expressed admiration for [Putin] â€¦ and pledge to resume torturing terrorism suspects.?Where?should the U.S. intelligence community's first PowerPoint presentation for Trump begin??"It beggars the imagination," said former CIA director Michael V.

Jose A. DelReal writes. â€œBut Mnuchinâ€™s political allegiances may also raise eyebrows among Trumpâ€™s critics in the Republican Party, who have remained skeptical of the mogulâ€™s conservative bona fides â€¦â€? A review of Mnuchin's past political donations shows he has donated to Republican and Democratic politicians alike: In addition to donating to Mitt Romney in 2012, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and the RNC, Mnuchin has also given to many Democrats:?then-senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, the presidential campaigns of Al Gore and John Kerry, Sen.

Bush will not be attending the convention, as confirmed by a spokesman. Former Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Sen.

From David Weigel : â€œThe decision of the two living Republican presidents to snub the party's 2016 White House nominee is extraordinary, yet completely predictable â€¦ while it demonstrates Trump's inability to unify the GOP, it is the best example yet of his strategy of breaking the electorate in half and hoping he wound up with the bigger piece. Losing the endorsements of George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush ? as harsh an indictment as the â€˜establishmentâ€™ can offer ? is no punishment at all in the eyes of many conservatives.â€?

From Greg Miller: â€œTwo months after Osama bin Laden was killed, the CIAâ€™s top operative in Pakistan was pulled out of the country in an abrupt move vaguely attributed to health concerns and his strained relationship with Islamabad. In reality, the CIA station chief was so violently ill that he was often doubled over in pain â€¦ And the cause of his ailment was so mysterious â€¦ both he and the agency began to suspect that he had been poisoned. The disclosure is a disturbing postscript to the sequence of events surrounding the bin Laden operation five years ago and adds new intrigue to a counterterrorism partnership that has often been consumed by conspiracy theories â€¦â€?

Even Sanders supporters would likely scoff at a news organization founded by Sanders. Have a look at this Pew chart from 2014 :\nOn the other hand: Sanders in recent months has stood before cameras to recite many of the same stories over and over again. So perhaps he has a future in cable news.\nopinions\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.
514846	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/05/09/confirmed-sanders-is-selling-a-fantasy-agenda/	Confirmed: Sanders is selling a fantasy agenda	2016-05-09 00:00:00	By Stephen Stromberg May 9 at 1:49 PM Follow @strombergsteve\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) (Christian Tyler Randolph/Charleston Gazette-Mail via Associated Press)\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has attracted a passionate following because he is selling his followers a fantasy. And not just any fantasy ? but one of epic proportions. A group of respected, nonpartisan experts offered the public a sense of the scale on Monday, releasing the most thorough analysis yet on Sandersâ€™s plan and finding that it is profoundly flawed. Before the Democrats agree to adopt his agenda, a price they might pay to get him to end his doomed campaign, they should be clear about what they are signing onto.\nThe analysts found that Sandersâ€™s program is very progressive, jacking up taxes massively on the rich and providing a range of new benefits to the poor. Though every working person would face higher payroll taxes, the value of these benefits would leave 95 percent of households better off. They granted Sanders that his single-payer health system, in which the government would pay for everyoneâ€™s care and demand no co-payments or other cost-sharing, would expand health-care access and cut the growth of health-care costs, and they made â€œaggressiveâ€? assumptions about how much the new system would reduce drug and other prices.\nBut there is a massive catch. Sandersâ€™s assurance that he has â€œa plan to pay for every spending program he has introduced to dateâ€? is wrong. And not just wrong, but extravagantly so. Even with his large tax increases, Sanders would fall $18 trillion short over just 10 years. Factoring in interest costs, his plan would add $21 trillion to the debt over a decade. That is more than the roughly $19 trillion the Treasury already owes. And the picture would probably get much worse as time went on. Expanding Social Security, for example, would become much more expensive as more people retired.\nSandersâ€™s health-care plan is the big budget-buster. It alone would cost $32 trillion over 10 years ? â€œmore than twice the new revenuesâ€? that Sanders would raise, Len Burman, the director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said on Monday. When reporters have asked Sanders about the costs of his health-care plan in the past, the senator has typically responded that other countries maintain functioning single-payer systems ? as though he has not proposed a specific plan that should be assessed on its own merits. Burman pointed out Monday that other countries do not promise their people as much as Sanders does. Making his system less costly, the analysts found, would require doing very unpopular things. Deeply cutting payments to doctors and hospitals, for example, would induce â€œsupply constraintsâ€? ? that is, a shortage of providers willing to meet demand for health services, which would make it harder to access care. Think long wait times and other hurdles.\nFully funding Sandersâ€™s spending plan, meanwhile, would be extremely difficult. He has already proposed raising taxes on the wealthy so dramatically that tapping upper incomes much more would start losing the federal government revenue, Burman explained. Instead, Sanders would have to significantly increase broad-based taxes, such as on consumption, to fill the gap.\nThe last option is simply letting the national debt balloon. Burman warned that conventional analysis would show this strategy â€œhurting the economy, potentially significantly.â€?\nSanders articulates broad principles ? free health care for all; free college for everyone. When pressed on the details, he falls back on broad explanations ? other countries to seem to do these sorts of things, so we can, too. But in the real world of policymaking, where specific numbers must add up and tradeoffs must be considered, his program is a flop.\nSanders is not thinking big, as he often puts it. He is thinking carelessly. Those attracted to his message of expanding health-care access and shoring up the safety net, which are worthy goals, should know that he does not have a real plan to do these things. Instead, Sanders offers unchecked ideological certainty and unkeepable promises.\nopinions\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

But buried in her answer was an interesting challenge to progressives ? one that suggests a way for the Sanders movement to reconstitute and reinvent itself after the primaries are over:\nâ€œIâ€™m three million votes ahead of Senator Sanders, nearly 300 pledged delegates ahead of him. He has to make his own mind up.\nâ€œBut I was very heartened to hear him say last week that he is going to work seven days a week to make sure Donald Trump doesnâ€™t become president. And I want to unify the party. I see a great role and opportunity for him and his supporters to be part of that unified party, to move into not just November to win the election against Donald Trump, but to then govern based on the progressive goals that he and I share.\nâ€œWe both want to raise the minimum wage. We both understand you have got to rein in bad actors on Wall Street and in corporate America to make sure they donâ€™t wreck Main Street. We have a lot of the same goals. And I hope we can unify around them.â€?\nClinton did not merely call on Sanders and his supporters to help unify the party in order to defeat Donald Trump in the general election. She also called on them to be an integral part of her governing coalition.\nI donâ€™t know how sincere Clinton is about this, but in a way, it doesnâ€™t matter. Because this effectively functions as a challenge to Sanders and his supporters ? to exert as much influence as possible over her agenda as president.\nThe question of how ? or whether ? the Sanders movement will endure, once Clinton wins the nomination, has been debated for months, and one possibility is that many Sanders supporters will see trying to influence her presidency as one constructive near-term path forward. If so, that suggests a more positive outcome than the one envisioned by some Sanders critics ? namely, that by campaigning on unrealistic goals, Sanders risks disillusioning a new generation, ultimately causing them to give up on politics in disillusionment and despair.\nAs Iâ€™ve argued , Sandersâ€™s candidacy can be understood as a deliberate effort to stake out overly ambitious goals, for the explicit purpose of bringing about a dramatic upward jolt in our baseline conception of a fair economy and just society. In service of moving us in that direction, Sanders has consciously sought to shift the boundaries of what we decide at the outset constitutes political realism, setting the goal at no less than a fundamental re-imagining of the American social contract. For all of his flaws ? such as his overly dismissive and reductive account of the achievements of the Obama era ? itâ€™s possible that this big picture approach is engaging untold numbers of young voters in Democratic politics for the first time. They perhaps believe their futures are at serious risk, due to political stalemate, economic instability and stagnation, and the looming climate threat, and want someone to unflinchingly champion government solutions that are ambitious enough to match the scale of the problems they believe they face. Recent polling suggests that this may be the case, and also suggests that more young voters are self-identifying as Democrats ? possibly due to Sandersâ€™s presence in the race .\nMeanwhile, as Nate Cohn details , the voting throughout the primaries suggests that Sanders may also be engaging blue collar white Democrats in ways that previous Democratic presidential insurgencies have not.\nAll this could accrue to the partyâ€™s benefit over time. But we donâ€™t know if that will happen. We donâ€™t know what will happen to the spirit and ideas Sanders has unleashed after he loses. And as Brian Beutler argues, this suggests a possible way forward . While Sanders â€œseeks nothing less than the wholesale transformation of the Democratic Party into a vessel for social-democratic politics,â€? a more modest outcome is possible. Sanders could try to\nextend the intra-liberal debate he sparked during the primary about the ideal scope and architecture of social policy into governing season. Heâ€™ll keep pressing the question: What should a country provide its citizenry, and should it provide those things to all, or only to some, on the basis of need?\nLike a Ryan of the left, Sanders will have an opportunity to cajole (and if need be, push) Democrats in a more progressive direction, but he can also serve as a bulwark against regressive policymaking, the same way conservatives have time and again stopped Republican leaders from consorting with Democrats on any measure that carries a whiff of liberalism. If and when President Clinton forges illiberal compromises with Republican leaders, Sanders will be one of the only people in Congress with a constituency wide enough to make other Democratic members consider rebelling against the leader of their party.\nThere are all kinds of obstacles to making this work. But Clinton ? whether she meant to or not ? has now basically invited Sanders and his supporters to give it a try.\n?\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

But only last year did?the program begin offering?the free rides on Cinco de Mayo.\nLast year on May 5, 164 adults who may have over-celebrated the Battle of Puebla got home safely thanks to SoberRide.\n[ Cinco de Mayo: Itâ€™s not Mexicoâ€™s independence day ]\nIf you find yourself in the same?situation Thursday, hereâ€™s what you do: Call 1-800-200-TAXI (8294) between 4 p.m. and 4 a.m., and if you are in the District or its suburbs, you can ask for a free taxi ride up to a $30 fare. You are responsible for anything over the $30 value.\nNo, you canâ€™t make a reservation beforehand. And you must be an adult to use the service. To be specific about the coverage area, itâ€™s the District and Alexandria, Montgomery and Prince Georgeâ€™s, and Arlington, Fairfax, Prince William and eastern Loudoun.\nSoberRide, which is sponsored by the Washington Regional Alcohol Program, also operates on St. Patrickâ€™s Day, Independence Day, Halloween and the winter holiday time up to the New Yearâ€™s Eve celebrations.\nMy favorite holiday travel tip comes from Kurt Gregory Erickson, the president of WRAP. He notes that some people misunderstand the definition of â€œdesignated driver.â€? Itâ€™s not the least drunk person in your group. Itâ€™s the one who pledges to stay away from alcoholic beverages for the evening.\nHaving a designated driver for Cinco de Mayo also is a fine choice. Erickson also has a tip for people who arenâ€™t celebrating, but will be in a vehicle on Thursday night: Wear your seat belt, whether you are the driver or passenger. SoberRide doesnâ€™t just protect the person who has been drinking. It can save the lives of travelers who might have become the victims of drunk drivers.\nlocal\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! https://t.co/ufoTeQd8yA pic.twitter.com/k01Mc6CuDI\n? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2016\nOkay, letâ€™s walk through this.\n1. I have not had the taco bowl at the Trump Tower Grill, a restaurant situated on the ground floor of Trump Tower. But in my experience (credentials: lived in California for seven years; wife makes it frequently, passed down from family), the best Mexican food comes from places where the focus is on Mexican food, not places where you could get a taco bowl or you could also get the lobster ravs or the â€œIvankaâ€™s salad.â€?\n2. Whatâ€™s more, New York City is great at everything, but notoriously crappy at Mexican food. Even the good Mexican food in New York City isnâ€™t that good. (I do have some recommendations, though, so feel free to email.)\n3. To reinforce that point, one (not particularly generous) reviewer said that the taco bowl â€œrendered an insult to Mexicans every bit as profound as Trumpâ€™s previous pronouncements.â€?\n4. But letâ€™s set that aside. Letâ€™s set aside the idea of?best taco bowls ? with an unqualified boundary for â€œbest,â€? implying that Trump is including the country of Mexico, where I sort of doubt they make a lot of taco bowls but if they did Iâ€™m confident theyâ€™d do it pretty well ? and letâ€™s focus on whatâ€™s happening here.\n5. First of all, Trump uses the hashtag #CincoDeMayo, suggesting that his eating a taco bowl on May 5?is linked to the Mexican holiday. (In fact, it appears to be a special of the day !)\nNot that the holiday is really a Mexican holiday. Itâ€™s an American thing , which a cynic might suggest is linked to the heavy recent marketing effort from Corona. Itâ€™s almost like Corona saw what St. Patrickâ€™s Day did for green beer, threw a dart at a list of Mexican holidays, and here we are.\n6. Put another way, itâ€™s sort of a white personâ€™s idea of what a Mexican celebration is like, sort of like how Chichiâ€™s restaurants used to be approximations of what a Mexican village looked like. (I am both dating and geolocating myself here, but whatever.) It is probably as authentic a celebration of Mexican culture as St. Patrickâ€™s is of Irish culture.\n7. And then Trump puts?a very, very fine point on it: â€œI love Hispanics!â€?\n8. I canâ€™t.\n9. It reminds me of this classic Onion headline: Woman Who â€˜Loves Brazilâ€™ Has Only Seen Four Square Miles of It . Itâ€™s Trump posing next to a donkey wearing a sombrero in Guadalajara. Iâ€™m seeing the world! Except, here, it's, Look! Iâ€™m eating your traditional food on your traditional holiday! I love you guys!\n10. Incidentally, not all Hispanics are Mexican, and many people of Mexican heritage prefer the term Latino or?Chicano , but thatâ€™s actually too nitpicky for this conversation.\n11. That pronouncement, though. There is definitely, as the Atlanticâ€™s David Graham noted this week, a pointed distinction between how Trump talks about some groups and how he talks about others. Hispanics, like black Americans, are this other group to which Trump tries to appeal, not part of the communal group of Americans that are included when he says â€œwe.â€? This is a foray into a foreign land.\n12. Granted, Trump does need to improve his standing with Hispanics. In an April Washington Post/ABC poll , 7 in 10 Hispanics had a strongly unfavorable view of Trump.\n13. But Trump isnâ€™t trying to appeal to Hispanics here. Heâ€™s trying to appeal to the other tourists, which is to say non-Hispanic white people. Heâ€™s trying to demonstrate to some extent that he really doesnâ€™t have a problem with Hispanic Americans ? that he, like anyone, can appreciate their traditions. Heâ€™s coming back from Guadalajara and showing the pictures, like that lady from Brazil, answering questions about the public transportation in Brasilia. Heâ€™s indicating that he has no problem with Hispanics. Not to Hispanics, but to his base.\n14. Well really, thatâ€™s secondary. Trump is mostly doing this to troll us, and we took the bait, and we canâ€™t help it, and oh, man,?Election Day is still so far away.\n1 of 10\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

And, no, you donâ€™t have to take a breath test.\nâ€œYou donâ€™t have to prove youâ€™re drunk,â€? said WRAP president Kurt Gregory Erickson, who announced the service Wednesday at a bilingual press conference at a Latino restaurant in Arlington. Last year 164 people used WRAPâ€™s SoberRide program during Cinco de Mayo festivities, he said.\nThe nonprofit is urging people to soak up all the tequila and mariachi music they like but to also stay off the roads if theyâ€™ve been boozing. People should arrange ahead of time to have a designated driver or be prepared to take Metro, call a cab or use a ride-sharing service such as Uber, Lyft or Split , Erickson said.\nIf all else fails, however, fiesta-goers can dial a toll-free number to get a ride home. And they mean your casa, not another bar. Although the service generally relies on the honor system, Erickson said, the nonprofit also monitors its use to make sure that people donâ€™t game the system (like the bar tender who was routinely using SoberRide to get home from his shift after last call).\nWRAPâ€™s service begins at 4 a.m. Thursday and continues until 4 a.m. Friday. The ride is free up to $30; in the past, the average fare has been $22, Erickson said. The organization also offers the service on other holidays linked by data to heavy drinking, including St. Patrickâ€™s Day, Halloween, and basically the winter holiday weekends leading up to New Yearâ€™s Eve.\n[ Should Metro be selling ads for booze? ]\n?\nThe small organization, which is headquartered in Tysons Corner, didnâ€™t just glom onto Cinco de Mayo based on its image as a hard-drinking holiday, although thereâ€™s that. National highway safety data show that more than a third of all U.S. traffic deaths on Cinco de Mayo involve drunk drivers. And nearly a fifth of those drunk drivers had blood-alcohol levels of 0.15 or higher, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nThe service also comes as Cinco de Mayo has grown in popularity, particularly among young people ? although no oneâ€™s quite sure why. The day marks the anniversary of Mexicoâ€™s victory over the ?French at the Battle Of Puebla on May 5, 1862, according to Digg , which collected a bunch of stories under the heading â€œCinco de Whyo?â€?\nJody Agius Vallejo, a sociology professor at the University of Southern California, was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that the festivities caught on as a day for Mexican-Americans to celebrate their ethnic pride just as other celebrations by immigrants have caught on. Cultural festivities coalesced around a holiday until the partying all but obscures what the actual event was.\nâ€œItâ€™s very similar to how Irish-Americans celebrate St. Patrickâ€™s Day,â€? Vallejo told the AP. â€œOne way they can honor their ethnicity is to celebrate this day, even when most donâ€™t know why.â€? An article in VinePair traces the holidayâ€™s boozy popularity to a 1989 ad campaign by San Antonio-based importers of Corona and Grupo Modelo beer.\nJosÃ© M. Alamillo, a professor at California State University Channel Islands, said that what was a minor holiday in Mexico became a big deal here perhaps because Mexican Americans were reluctant to put on a rousing celebration on the real Mexican Independence Day (May 16), owing to the awkwardness of marking oneâ€™s independence in another country. But Alamillo also suggested that it may have had more to do with seasonal patterns in the Southwest, as migrant farmworkers found it more convenient to celebrate cultural pride following Mayâ€™s harvest of citrus fruit, rather than later? in the year.\n?\n[ I Grew Up in Mexico, but Drunk Americans Showed Me What Cinco de Mayo was ]\nWRAPâ€™s service will be available for a 12-hour period in the Washington metro area, including the District, Montgomery and Prince Georgeâ€™s counties in Maryland and Arlington, Fairfax, Prince William counties and the eastern part of Loudoun County.\nPartiers who find theyâ€™ve had one too many margaritas can arrange a ride by calling the toll-free number 1?800?200?TAXI (8294).

(Screen shot from Donald Trump's Twitter feed)\nBy David Weigel May 5 at 7:05 PM Follow daveweigel\nDonald Trump marked his first full day as the presumptive Republican nominee for president with an old habit: Tweeting something that people couldnâ€™t believe theyâ€™d just seen.\nOn Twitter and Facebook, the real estate mogul shared a picture of himself smiling widely and eating a sour cream-covered pile of Mexican food inside of a crispy flour shell.\nâ€œHappy #CincoDeMayo!â€? wrote Trump, celebrating, in his way, the Mexican armyâ€™s 1862 victory over French invaders. â€œThe best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!â€?\nWithin an hour, Trumpâ€™s celebration of Hispanic culture and himself had been retweeted more than 34,000 times, rocketing to the top of the Twitter â€œMomentsâ€? metric. By contrast, the White Houseâ€™s announcement of a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau rule that would widen consumersâ€™ ability to file class-action lawsuits against banks was retweeted less than 150 times. Trump, not the president, had captured the mediaâ€™s imagination, enjoying Mexican food despite favoring a â€œdeportation forceâ€? and a wall on the Mexican border.\nâ€œI didnâ€™t predict that the Republican Party would lose its f---ing mind,â€? tweeted Nate Silver, whose site FiveThirtyEight just published a mea culpa for insisting Trump would not win the nomination.\nThe Republican presidential front-runner reversed course on a whole load of issues ? all on May 4. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\nâ€œWeâ€™re sending a squad of fact-checkers to Trump Tower to taste the taco bowl,â€? tweeted the ?public-service website Politifact.\nReporters quickly pored over the tweet to find meaning. A reporter for Buzzfeed called the Trump Tower Grill to confirm that it did not sell a taco bowl. Milo Yiannopoulous, an â€œalternative rightâ€? writer and speaker who supports Trump, quickly pointed out that the $13.25 item was sold at the Trump Cafe, elsewhere in the mogulâ€™s eponymous Manhattan tower.\nFood writers sprang into action, too, pointing to crowdsourced ratings on Yelp that pronounced the food in Trump Towerâ€™s restaurants to be bland. Indeed, the crispy shell that serves as the taco saladâ€™s bowl, and is typically fried in oil or lard, counteracting the health benefits of its contents, was invented by Americans, not Mexicans. In an April poll conducted by Latino Decisions, 79 percent of Latino voters expressed unfavorable opinions of Trump ? something he has insisted he will overcome in the general election.\nHillary Clintonâ€™s campaign, which has reacted with something like delight at the prospect of running against Trump, took less than an hour to respond. â€œ â€˜I love Hispanics!â€™ ?Trump, 52 minutes ago,â€? the campaign tweeted. â€œ â€˜Theyâ€™re gonna be deported.â€™ ? Trump, yesterday.â€?\nThere was no such response from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. As discussion of the taco bowl swirled, he tweeted that Americans were â€œtired of working longer hours for lower wages and seeing almost all new income going to the top 1 percent.â€? It was retweeted less than 1,000 times.\n1 of 10\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)\nCharles Oakley is from Cleveland. He also tangled with Charles Barkley repeatedly while both were in the NBA and has subsequently expressed his disdain for the Hall of Famer and TNT basketball analyst.\nThose facts were brought immediately to mind Wednesday, when Oakley posted this tweet:\nCharles Barkley ,you better stop talking s*** about Cleveland you was never tough you hide behind TNT\n? Charles Oakley (@CharlesOakley34) May 5, 2016\nWhoa! No one ever doubted Oakleyâ€™s toughness, but he clearly was in a mood to call out Barkley for a lack of it. (Also, nice of the former Knicks and Bulls enforcer to provide his own censorship).\nFrom the timing of Oakleyâ€™s tweet, it was apparent that he was reacting to comments Barkley made on the set of TNTâ€™s â€œInside the NBAâ€? following Game 2 of the?Cavaliers-Hawks playoff series. Cleveland had just dropped an astonishing 25 three-pointers ? an all-time league record ? on Atlanta en route to an easy, 123-98 win, and Barkley said, â€œThe Atlanta Hawks got to take somebody out.â€?\n[ The Cavs hit so many threes the Hawks gave themselves the crying Jordan treatment ]\nBarkley was expressing a feeling that the Cavs had been disrespectful by spending the fourth quarter heaving three-point attempts in pursuit of the record, but co-analyst Shaquille Oâ€™Neal took issue with the implication that the Hawks should have possibly injured any?of their opponents.\n"The Atlanta Hawks got to take somebody out." ? Charles Barkley pic.twitter.com/hz3gXL434k\n? Kenny Ducey (@KennyDucey) May 5, 2016\nOakley, who played high school ball in Cleveland before attending Virginia Union, was obviously irked, as well. Given his online reaction, many were reminded of the time the two prolific rebounders swung at each other during a 1996 preseason game between the Knicks and Barkleyâ€™s Rockets.\nThen there was the occasion, in 1999, when Oakley reportedly smacked Barkley at a players union meeting. Here is a passage from a New York Daily News article about that incident:\nThe unofficial start to the NBA season came sometime Wednesday afternoon when Charles Oakley said he belted his longtime nemesis Charles Barkley in the face during the players union meeting. â€œI heard what he was saying about me in Atlantic City and I didnâ€™t like it,â€? Oakley said last night. â€œIâ€™m fed up with him. I told him you need to change your name. Iâ€™m the only Charles.â€? â€¦\nOakley claims Barkley plays the punk when he tries to be friendly off the court. â€œHe did that the other day,â€? Oakley said. â€œHe thought everything was cool, but Iâ€™m not his friend. Then everybody grabbed us.â€?\nOak?may have aged a bit over the years, but apparently time has not done much to mellow his feelings toward Sir Charles (and the fact that Barkley became much more synonymous with that first name canâ€™t have helped matters). Here are some comments he offered to ESPN in 2012:\nâ€œI donâ€™t go around talking to [Barkley]. He has opinions. He talks every Tuesday and Thursday about things I did. I just donâ€™t like the way he tried to act like he was a good citizen when he played or that he was this and that. He was one of the hardest people to get along with, to play with, everything ? but people donâ€™t write about it. People give him a free pass because heâ€™s on TV, but I donâ€™t believe in that. When he spit on the guy in Cleveland, he got a break. I just donâ€™t like when you preach one thing and do something else. Thatâ€™s what the world is coming to. Itâ€™s just phony. Nobody stands up for what they say anymore.â€?\nLittle wonder that someone saw fit Wednesday to update Oakleyâ€™s Wikipedia page (or at least rig up a humorously on-point image for a tweet).\n?

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)\nCHICAGO ? Dusty Baker has been back here before, or at least some version of here, because Wrigley Field is not the same as when he stopped calling it home more than a decade ago, not the same as when he stopped managing the Reds in the visitorsâ€™ dugout in 2013.\nAs he walked in for his Washington Nationalsâ€™ series opener with the Cubs on Thursday, he noticed the McDonaldâ€™s across the street was gone, saw new office buildings and peeked in at the Cubsâ€™ newly renovated clubhouse area.\nâ€œLook at this place,â€? Baker said. â€œBefore, I was in kind of a dungeon here around the corner.?I walked in here and saw the lights and stuff, I was ready to Saturday Night Fever.â€?\nHe held his pregame media session down a hallway off the concourse, which still smelled like fresh paint, in a?new interview facility, where a red-and-white Washington Nationals background was propped in front of Cubs colors. Normally, visiting managers meet a small crew of traveling writers in the dugout, which generally has plenty of room to hold the horde. On Thursday, Nationals public relations staff moved his meeting to the interview room Joe Maddon normally uses because so much Chicago media would be on hand, too. By the end of his four-season tenure with the Cubs, which began with Steve Bartman and a missed chance at a?World Series and ended with a 66-96 season in 2006, Baker was not exactly revered here.\nChicago media packed the interview room, too.\nâ€œIâ€™d like to think I had an impact. I kinda wish at the end Iâ€™d have felt a little more that I had a positive impact,â€? Baker said. â€œBut sometimes, people appreciate you more when youâ€™re gone than when youâ€™re there. So on the other hand, I think about many times I wanted to be the guy that won it in Chicago. And we were close.â€?\nâ€œSo now Iâ€™m in a similar situation in D.C. They havenâ€™t been in existence that long, but baseballâ€™s been in D.C. for a long period of time. This is the third try at baseball, since Iâ€™ve been alive, in D.C. So now Iâ€™ve got a new goal: to be the first guy to manage a team to the World Series and win in D.C.â€?\nHis Nationals are 19-8 as they begin this series, the second-best record in the National League. The loaded Cubs are 20-6, drawing early parallels to the 1998 Yankees and other uncommonly?dominant teams. The Cubs keep winning, against foes formidable and forgettable. So?how does this current Cubs team compare to?the one Baker nearly took to the World Series, or the one that played here in 2004, which one Chicago writer posited Thursday may have been even better?\nâ€œI havenâ€™t really seen â€™em, but [these Cubs] have more depth than we had,â€? Baker said. â€œThey have a better bullpen than we had then, which is no consolation, but thatâ€™s why I had to stretch out my starters longer than I even wanted to because we didnâ€™t have a bullpen like we have now. Not to say we didnâ€™t have a good bullpen, but at that time, we had to make a big trade to make that pushâ€¦â€?\nThat trade included Aramis Ramirez, whose name earned pursed lips and an â€œooh,â€? from Baker, who generally reserves such reactions for the biggest of big names. He continued his reflections from there.\nâ€œWhat kind of upset me a little bit was how much money they spent when I left,â€? he said. â€œBut when I look back, I had to realize the Cubs werenâ€™t spending money then because of the transition for the Tribune Company to be sold. You look back on things ? â€˜how come we didnâ€™t do this?â€™ â€˜How come we didnâ€™t do that?â€™ Again, baseball takes a backseat to baseball business.â€?\nsports\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Orlin Wagner/AP)\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. ? For an early May series, Nationals-Cubs will be as good as it gets. The Cubs are 20-6 with a historic run differential , the highest-scoring offense in the majors and the best pitching staff statistically. The Nationals are 19-8 with an improving offense,?a defense that has made the fewest errors in baseball and the majorsâ€™ second-best pitching staff by the numbers.\nâ€œThe Cubs are great,â€? right fielder Bryce Harper said. â€œThey have a great team. They have a great manager. I think [president Theo Epstein has]?done a great job putting a team together that can win. Theyâ€™ve got a lot of young talent with Kris Bryant and [Anthony] Rizzo. You can go on and on with all the guys they have. Just go in there and try to have good at-bats and try to get into their bullpen as best we can and get their starters out of the game and see what we can do against a great Cubs team.â€?\nThe Cubs have been a dual threat on the mound and at the plate. Statistically, the Nationals have a comparable pitching staff; the Cubs have a 2.32 ERA versus?the Nationalsâ€™ 2.35 ERA. The Nationals have played superior defense but the Cubs are far outscoring opponents thanks to Dexter Fowler (1.057 OPS), Rizzo (1.039 OPS), Bryant (.303 average) and Ben Zobrist (.373 on-base percentage).\nâ€œWeâ€™re playing good baseball,â€? starter Stephen Strasburg said. â€œWhen one guy starts to cool off a little bit, another guy seems to pick him up. So weâ€™re having a good time and weâ€™ve got some good chemistry going on in the clubhouse so weâ€™re trying to take that into Chicago.â€?\nThe pitching matchups, however, will be the main attraction of the four-game set. In order: Joe Ross (0.79 ERA) vs. Kyle Hendricks (3.91 ERA) in the opener, Max Scherzer (3.55 ERA) vs. John Lackey (4.32 ERA) on Friday, Gio Gonzalez (1.15 ERA) vs. Jason Hammel (1.24 ERA) on Saturday, and Tanner Roark (2.35 ERA) vs. Jake Arrieta (0.84 ERA) in the finale.\nThe Nationals will have their hands more than full with Hammel and, most of all, reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Arrieta. Their offense has been up and down since the season started but exploded for 13 runs on Monday. If there are reasons to be bullish about the Nationals offense, it is because of Daniel Murphyâ€™s hot bat, that Harper snapped out of his slump on Wednesday, Wilson Ramos returned, Ryan Zimmerman is heating up (.348 average over the past week) and Jayson Werth homered twice already on this road trip.\nMaybe he wanted to downplay the series, but Nationals Manager Dusty Baker said he doesnâ€™t believe in making a statement with a strong showing against a team like the Cubs.\nâ€œPeople know weâ€™ve got a good team,â€? he said. â€œWeâ€™ve got to go out there and do it. The next four days of the road trip are the toughest because we havenâ€™t been on a 10-day road trip this year. The next four, you canâ€™t start thinking about home. Youâ€™ve got to play all the way through the end of the road trip.\nâ€œAs life is, youâ€™ve got to finish strong. Thatâ€™s what I tell my son all the time. Youâ€™ve got to finish strong with it whether itâ€™s in your homework or your life work or in baseball. Youâ€™ve got to finish strong. I remember Sugar Ray Leonard. He had that flourish at the end that would sway the judges.

Simple as that,â€? Baker said. â€œHe works the strike zone, good sinker, good slider. This guyâ€™s going to be good for a long time.â€?\n[ Bakerâ€™s return to Wrigley so popular with media they needed a bigger room ]\nMeanwhile, Hendricks held the Nationals to two hits in six innings. Taylor had one of those hits, a double to the gap in left center. Bryce Harper had the other. After singling and homering Wednesday against the Royals, seemingly clawing out of his week-long slump, the reigning MVP walked three times and singled and reached base in 4 of 4 chances.\nBut with two hits to their name, the Nationals still trailed by just two heading to the eighth. Cubs reliever Pedro Strop hit Danny Espinosa, then walked pinch hitter Clint Robinson to give the Nationals runners at first and second with no one out. Baker opted to let Taylor hit instead of bunting the runners over ahead of Rendon and Harper.\nHe explained the decision as the choice between playing for two runs ? a tie ? and playing for a win. Since speedy Taylor is not a double play risk, Baker gambled on letting him swing away. He fouled off his best pitch to hit, a hanging slider, and ended up striking out.\nâ€œIâ€™ve got to shorten it up right there and put the ball in play,â€? Taylor said.\nRendon hit into a double play and left Harper on deck.\nâ€œHindsightâ€™s easy to say shouldâ€™ve done this or that, but Taylor had a good pitch to hit,â€? Baker said. â€œ. . . He got a hanging slider right there and fouled it back. They got away with one that time.â€?\nIt will be little consolation to these Nationals that Ross beat the Cubsâ€™ gaudy offensive averages, that they hung in there until late against a team compiling one of the more dominant starts in baseball history.\nIt will be some consolation that they are 19-9 overall, 5-2 on this grueling road trip and may get Opening Day center fielder Ben Revere back Friday.

Four games with the Cubs follow; Chicago has the best record in the National League at 20-6. Orlin Wagner/AP\nBy Thomas Boswell Columnist May 5 at 4:07 PM Follow @ThomasBoswellWP\nEveryone has their own definition of big fun. High on my list is the four-game series between the Chicago Cubs and Washington Nationals that started Thursday night with a 5-2 victory for the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Every inning of every game will be worth enjoying and analyzing. By Sunday night we might not know where these teams stand relative to each other, but we will sure know a lot more.\nFor jubilant context, the Cubs and Nats entered their faceoff with the two best records in baseball as well as the best team ERAs, both marks insanely and unsustainably great (2.32 and 2.35) . These clubs also may have the two most cheerful baseball-as-joy managers in the game: Joe Maddon and Dusty Baker. Theyâ€™re baseball lifers and students of the sport, and both believe that confidence, relaxation and fun are almost as important as talent.\nTom Boswell is a Washington Post sports columnist. View Archive\n[ Joe Maddon on Bryce Harper: â€˜He respects the gameâ€™ ]\nMaddon once allowed a pet python into his clubhouse. Baker last quoted a Van Morrison lyric one day ago. If Maddon had Bryce Harper and Jayson Werth , he would want them to get more expressive hair styles. Baker co-invented the high-five. Maddon wishes he had. If these clubs tie for best record in the National League, home field in the playoffs should be decided by best managerial air guitar.\nHereâ€™s a secret: Under their smiles, both men have managed one World Series team ? and lost. Neither is happy about it. Both are on a quest, as much as any manager. They just hide it because they think anxiety is a baseball toxin. Cool and calm is their crusade. That isnâ€™t easy either.\nThe Chicago Cubs' underground, 30,000-square-foot clubhouse features hyperbaric chambers, a float pod, mood lighting and much more. "This is the most expensive of all the clubhouses that were built in the modern age," said the Cubs business president Crane Kenney. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n[ Fearing no jinxes, Cubs embrace World Series favorite status ]\nThese clubs also will match baseball brains. Cubs General Manager Theo Epstein is a double World Series champion legend and hires many of the best front-office minds in the game. The Natsâ€™ Mike Rizzo isnâ€™t far behind, and with pitching coach Mike Maddux and base-thief guru Davey Lopes joining Bakerâ€™s staff, the Nats have elevated their baseball IQ as much as any team.\nWith far more shifts, the Nats own baseballâ€™s second-best â€œdefensive efficiencyâ€? ? that means turning batted balls into outs through blatant theft. Whoâ€™s better? Only the Cubs.\nWhat we will see this weekend is just the first battle of what may be a long-running war. Since the start of 2011, only one team in MLB has won more games than the Nats (the Cardinals). But last season, the Cubs arrived with 97?wins. The Cubsâ€™ lineup is loaded with precocious kids who are under team contract for years, while the Nats are so soundly, deeply and inexpensively built that this is probably the start of a Cubs-Nats rivalry for, at least, the next three seasons.\nThe NL team with the most money is still the Dodgers and those with the most regal pedigrees, still intact, reside in St.?Louis and San Francisco. But for the next few years, Iâ€™ll take the chances of the Cubs, Mets and Nats reaching the World Series; you get the other dozen.\nHow scorching are the Cubs? No team since 1905 has outscored its first 26 opponents by such a huge margin: 93 runs . If not for that monster margin, the Natsâ€™ run differential of plus-50 would be remarkable.\nHowever, all is not as it seems in measuring these two teams at the weigh-in. â€œEveryone knowsâ€? that the Cubsâ€™ record is legitimate because they have supposedly played a normal schedule while the Nats, weâ€™ve told ourselves, have played patsies. As is often the case, â€œeveryone,â€? including me, may not be looking at the whole picture. Based on last yearâ€™s records and preseason reputations, the Cubs have faced representative foes. And the Nats, until they recently went 5-1 in St.?Louis and Kansas City, faced teams with â€œbumâ€? tags.\nWashington Nationals pitchers Max Scherzer has nearly 60 dives under his belt and has traveled to Fiji, Mexico and the Caymans. (Max Scherzer)\nBut in baseball, how you played last year or what you were predicted to do must be balanced against how you are actually playing, in reality, right now. Both matter.\nThatâ€™s a different picture. By that measure, the Nats have played winners (10-8 in games against teams with .500-or-better records this season), and the Cubs have not (5-1 in games against such opponents). The Cubs have played 20 games against losers (15-5), while the Nats have played just nine (9-0).\nThose numbers got your attention? If you donâ€™t want more stats, skip the next three paragraphs.\nERA-plus is a fine way to measure a pitcherâ€™s value. It shows by what percentage you surpass the average league ERA (defined as 100), adjusted for home park. Bob Gibson, Roy Oswalt, Curt Schilling, Kevin Brown and Tom Seaver were all 127. Thatâ€™s a wide range. The point: An ERA-plus around 125, especially for 1,000 or more innings, means youâ€™re really good.\n[ On baseball: Jake Arrieta is dominating again ? not even at his best ]\nHere are the career ERA-plus marks of the Natsâ€™ and Cubsâ€™ rotations. Some innings totals, such as those of Tanner Roark (401), Kyle Hendricks (283) and Joe Ross (99), are small enough that they may change utterly. Still, I wouldnâ€™t have gotten this list remotely correct: Ross (136), Stephen Strasburg (128), Roark (127), Jon Lester (122), Max Scherzer (120), Jake Arrieta (113), Gio Gonzalez (112), John Lackey (110), Hendricks (110) and Jason Hammel (97).\nThe past four years as a Cub, Arrieta (42-13, 2.14 ERA) has an ERA-plus of 181! The best by any starter in history is 155 by Clayton Kershaw, then 154 by Pedro Martinez.\nOften the first month of a baseball season misleads us. That may be the case again. But three NL teams ? and only three ? have announced themselves so far as deadly serious as well as red hot: the Cubs, Mets and Nats. All three have faced weak schedules; Baseball-Reference.com ranks them identically weak (minus-0.4 runs a game).\nBut until other contenders ignite and join the discussion, any and all meetings between these NL front-runners will merit our closest attention, especially because no one in the AL seems to have much of a pulse so far. Can the Nats not only survive but thrive on their road trip from hell to St. Louis, Kansas City and Chicagoâ€™s north side? Can closer Jonathan Papelbon handle the ninth inning against fine teams, not just mediocre or poor ones?\nAnd can anyone, anyone at all, handle the apparently invincible historic Cubs, the most overwhelming World Series favorite in eons ? or, at least, since the Nationals a year ago.\nsports\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(LGBT). By merely saying the word â€œtransgender,â€? Obama did something no other president had ever done in a State of the Union speech.\nOn Monday, the Justice Department went a giant step further. It is suing North Carolina over its blatantly discriminatory â€œbathroom lawâ€? that requires transgender men and women to use the bathroom of their sex at birth. And as incredible and unprecedented as that move is, Attorney General Loretta Lynchâ€™s remarks justifying her action were breathtaking. None more than the penultimate paragraph .\nLet me also speak directly to the transgender community itself. ?Some of you have lived freely for decades. ?Others of you are still wondering how you can possibly live the lives you were born to lead. ?But no matter how isolated or scared you may feel today, the Department of Justice and the entire Obama Administration wants you to know that we see you; we stand with you; and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward. ?Please know that history is on your side. ?This country was founded on a promise of equal rights for all, and we have always managed to move closer to that promise, little by little, one day at a time. ?It may not be easy ? but weâ€™ll get there together.\nThe emotional punch is in?â€œwe see you.â€? Minorities long to be â€œseenâ€? by their government. Not as a problem or a nuisance, but as an integral part of society that is owed the same equal protection under the law that others take for granted. This is especially true for transgender Americans.\n[ Bruce Jenner, Jacob Lemay and what it means to be transgender ]\nAfter decades of being the silent T of LGBT, the transgender community finds itself at once a hot topic and a target. So-called bathroom bills are part of the larger backlash against the Supreme Courtâ€™s historic ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. At the same time, the nation is engaged in an incredible conversation about what it means to be transgender.

(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\nNorth Carolina and the Justice Department announced dueling lawsuits Monday over the stateâ€™s â€œbathroom bill,â€? which has become the epicenter of a larger fight over transgender rights.\nThe two complaints, filed several hours apart, took opposing sides in the debate over the law, which bans transgender people from using bathrooms that donâ€™t match the gender on their birth certificates. While the state said its law does not discriminate against transgender people or treat transgender employees differently from non-transgender employees, the Justice Departmentâ€™s civil rights office said the measure is discriminatory and violates civil rights.\nâ€œThis action is about a great deal more than just bathrooms,â€?

Board of Education decision.\nâ€œIt was not so very long ago that states, including North Carolina, had signs above restrooms, water fountains and on public accommodations keeping people out based upon a distinction without a difference,â€? Lynch, a North Carolina native, said during her unusually impassioned remarks.\n[ Is discrimination against transgender people a form of sex discrimination? ]\nVanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departmentâ€™s civil rights division, said Monday that calling the law a â€œbathroom bill,â€? as it has become commonly known, â€œtrivializesâ€? the measureâ€™s true impact, which she said could affect state employees, students and sports fans alike.\nâ€œIt speaks to all of us who have ever been made to feel inferior ? like somehow we just donâ€™t belong in our community, like somehow we just donâ€™t fit in,â€? Gupta said. â€œLet me reassure every transgender individual, right here in America, that you belong just as you are.â€?\nFive days ago, the Justice Department sent a letter to McCrory and other public officials calling on them to abandon the law because it violated federal civil rights statutes. Gupta gave the governor until the close of business Monday to respond.\nNotably absent from McCroryâ€™s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, was Margaret Spellings, president of the University of North Carolina System, who had also received a letter from the Justice Department relating to the law.\nNorth Carolina receives more than $4 billion in federal education funding each year, much of it in the form of student loans, and the Education Department has said it is reviewing whether to withhold that money because of the bathroom law. The government has withheld funds from schools before over civil rights issues, including when dozens of districts in Southern states refused to desegregate in the 1960s.\nThe Justice Departmentâ€™s lawsuit, in addition to naming the state of North Carolina, also includes the stateâ€™s department of public safety, and the University of North Carolina and the schoolâ€™s board of governors.\n[ Read the Justice Dept.â€™s lawsuit against North Carolina ]\nIn a letter to Gupta on Monday, Spellings said the UNC System takes seriously â€œits obligations to comply with federal non-discrimination statutesâ€? and had scheduled a special meeting of its board of governors for Tuesday afternoon. Spellings said in a statement that the university â€œis truly caught in the middleâ€? ? stuck between adhering to state law and being a welcoming home for its students ? and said this meeting Tuesday would help determine UNCâ€™s next steps.\nThe North Carolina law has drawn intense opposition from business groups and, in at least two high-profile cases, cost the state jobs and money. After McCrory signed the law, PayPal and Deutsche Bank both said they were abandoning expansion plans in the state because of the measure. The companies had planned to employ hundreds of people in North Carolina, and state officials said these expansions would have brought millions of dollars to local economies.\nThe National Basketball Association has said it will move the All-Star Game from Charlotte next season if the law is not changed, while tourism agencies have said the legislation has cost the state millions in lost business ? and possibly much more if other groups cancel events.\nThe White House was critical of North Carolinaâ€™s decision Monday, with Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, saying during a briefing that the state was â€œasserting that this mean-spirited law is somehow consistent with the Civil Rights Act and with our values.â€? He said he did not know of any way the lawsuit had changed the reviews that several federal agencies are conducting to consider withholding funding to North Carolina.\nMcCrory said he had asked the Justice Department for an extension to the â€œunrealisticâ€? Monday deadline and was turned down unless he made a statement agreeing that the measure was discriminatory.\n[ Read North Carolinaâ€™s lawsuit against the Justice Dept. ]\nâ€œIâ€™m not going to publicly announce that something discriminates, which is agreeing with their letter, because weâ€™re really?talking about a letter in which theyâ€™re trying to define gender identity,â€? McCrory said in an interview Sunday with Fox News .?â€œAnd there is no clear identification or definition of gender identity. Itâ€™s the federal government being a bully.â€?\nNorth Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper (D), who will face McCrory in what is expected to be a close gubernatorial election in November, has said he will not defend the measure. He said Monday that McCrory was â€œpouring gas on the fire that he litâ€? by filing a lawsuit against the federal government.\nâ€œInstead of doing whatâ€™s right for our state, heâ€™s doubling down on what he knows he did wrong,â€? Cooper said in a video message?Monday. â€œEnough is enough.â€?\nAlso Monday, the top Republicans in the North Carolina legislature ? Sen. Phil Berger, president pro tempore of the ?Senate, and Rep. Tim Moore, speaker of the House ?? filed their own lawsuit against the Justice Department, arguing that the federal agency was violating the 10th Amendment by trying to â€œimpose novel and unforeseen interpretationsâ€? of civil rights statutes.\nâ€œItâ€™s unacceptable for the Obama administration to try to intimidate North Carolina taxpayers into accepting their radical?reinterpretation of a law meant to protect women from discrimination into a law that would actually deny women their right?to basic safety and privacy,â€? Berger and Moore said in a statement.\nMcCrory said Monday that the Justice Department had asked North Carolina officials to â€œset aside their constitutional duty and refuse to follow or enforce our state law.â€? As he did last week after receiving the letter, he said that this has broad implications, stating: â€œThis is not just a North Carolina issue. This is now a national issue.â€?\nThree groups challenging the bathroom measure in federal court ? the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of North Carolina and Lambda Legal ? released a statement saying that McCrory â€œdoubled down on discriminationâ€? against transgender people with his suit Monday.\nâ€œTransgender people work for the state of North Carolina, attend school in North Carolina, and are a part of every community across the state,â€? the groups said in their statement. â€œIt is unconscionable that the government is placing a target on their backs to advance this discriminatory political agenda. Lawsuits are normally filed to stop
 discrimination ? not to continue it.â€?\nNiraj Chokshi, Emma Brown and David Nakamura contributed to this report.\nFurther reading:\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Katie Zezima/The Washington Post)\nThis post has been updated\nCHARLOTTE ? Shahrzad McNaughton is proud to be from North Carolina ? the first tattoo she ever got was an interpretation of this cityâ€™s crown logo surrounded by dogwoods, the state flower. But since North Carolina passed a law that rolled back rights for gay, lesbian and transgender people, she has soured on the state she has called home for most of her life.\nâ€œIâ€™m proud to be a North Carolinian, but Iâ€™m ashamed of the legislation,â€? said McNaughton, 26, who was drinking beer on a patio on a muggy spring night, a dog curled up in her lap. â€œIâ€™m ashamed of this state, and I hate to say that.â€?\nA non-discrimination ordinance passed in this?city sparked the law, which became the subject of the highest levels of legal volleying Monday when Gov. Pat McCrory sued the federal government. McCrory said the law does not violate the rights of transgender people. Hours later, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch filed a suit accusing the state of violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\nOn May 9, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced dueling lawsuits regarding HB2, a law that requires people to use public restrooms according to the sex they were assigned at birth, rather than the one they identify with. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\nThe legislation, known as the?â€œbathroom lawâ€? because it mandates that people use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate, was passed in response to an anti-discrimination ordinance passed in Charlotte?in February that extended new protections to gay, lesbian and transgender people.\n[ North Carolina, Justice Dept. file dueling lawsuits over transgender rights ]\nSome think?the fight has cast a pall over the state and this city of nearly 800,000. PayPal scrapped plans to create 400 jobs in Charlotte?after the law was passed, and the state was rebuked by corporations including Apple. The NBA has indicated that it may move next yearâ€™s All-Star game somewhere else.\nSome here are going out of their way to send a message that Charlotte welcomes all. A handful of bars and restaurants have switched all of their bathrooms to unisex. The Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority and local businesses started the â€œAlways Welcome Charlotteâ€? campaign to promote diversity and inclusivity.\nâ€œThe damage is deep, itâ€™s broad and it will be awhile before we recover,â€? Mayor Jennifer Roberts said in an interview on the steps of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center after a city council meeting where Roberts said a man holding a Bible told her she was going to hell for standing behind the anti-discrimination ordinance.\nRoberts said conventions that typically book far into the future have refused to come to North Carolina because of the law, depriving restaurants, printing companies, hotels and small businesses of income for years to come. McCrory, who used to be the mayor of Charlotte, blamed the city for starting the firestorm by raising the issue of gender identity and gender expression.\nâ€œNo one in North Carolina was talking about bathroom policy until the Charlotte city council imposed a mandate on private businesses,â€? McCrory said Monday.\nMcCroryâ€™s office did not return requests for comment.\n[ â€˜Bathroom lawâ€™ puts North Carolina governor in crossfire of GOP civil war ]\nâ€œOur city did the right thing. We stood up for equality, we are in line with civil rights, with the civil rights law, with human rights, and we will continue to profess and express and demonstrate those values,â€? Roberts?said.\nShe said she is pleased with Lynchâ€™s action and has not yet spoken with the attorney general, but plans to. Right now, Roberts?said, the city is in legal limbo ? it does not yet know whether?it has to comply with state law or abide by the Justice Departmentâ€™s instructions. Lawyers are looking into it, she said.\nIn impassioned remarks, Lynch linked the bill with Jim Crow laws and resistance to the Brown vs. Board of Education decision. McCrory, speaking on the Mark Levin Show, said his chief of staff, who is black and whose father fought for civil rights in the state, told McCrory that Lynch shouldnâ€™t go there.\nâ€œThere is absolutely no relevance between the issue of civil rights for African-Americans, which went through a tremendous struggle, and the issue of how do we determine the gender of a person going into our public showers or public restrooms or public locker rooms,â€? McCrory said.\nâ€œAnd for her to pull that card out means her legal argument is pretty weak. But itâ€™s offensive to my state and itâ€™s offensive to me,â€? he said.\nRoberts said she texted McCrory before he signed the bill asking the governor not to do so and expressing concerns that the city could lose Title IX?educational funding.\nâ€œI really tried to plead with him as the former mayor of the great city of Charlotte. I said, please, understand what youâ€™re doing,â€? she said. â€œBecause there is a cloud over not just your former city but also your state.â€?\nRoberts said she thinks many in Raleigh, the state capital, donâ€™t understand how cities need to be inclusive to be competitive in the 21st-century economy.\nâ€œI feel like we have people making laws for our state who donâ€™t truly represent North Carolina,â€? she said.\nAt one point, a man in a Donald Trump hat walked past Roberts and said, â€œI pray for you every week.â€?\nRoberts responded, â€œAll prayers are welcome.â€?\nLawrence Shaheen Jr., a lawyer and political consultant, attended a meeting of local Republicans on Monday night. Shaheen thinks the city ordinance is part of a â€œradical left-wing agendaâ€? that the Obama administration is enforcing by â€œdictatorship.â€? Shaheen?thinks the city of Charlotte overreached with the ordinance and that the state bill is necessary to keep restrooms single-sex.\nâ€œI think the mayor is completely out of touch with the city, and I hope she survives her primary next time, because I really donâ€™t think sheâ€™s gonna be here much longer,â€? Shaheen said.\nThe bill, he said, is necessary; he thinks that it will keep grown men out of womenâ€™s restrooms frequented by little girls.\nâ€œNorth Carolina has been a place where liberals come to try to cause culture wars. Instead we pass common-sense legislation to make sure that we can actually have a good place to live,â€? he said. When asked about PayPal pulling out of the city he said, â€œYouâ€™re welcome not to come here.â€?\nMarc Rotterman, a conservative activist and veteran of the Ronald Reagan campaign, thinks Lynch, a native North Carolinian who is well-respected here, is overreaching.\nâ€œItâ€™s a solution in search of a problem,â€? he said, adding that the issue has â€œbeen blown out of proportion.â€?\nRotterman said he would not be surprised if the issue made its way to the Supreme Court.\nOutside of Growlers Pourhouse in the hipster NoDa neighborhood, Phoenix Hunter and Will Haywood smoked cigarettes and could be heard discussing?the law. Growlers changed its two single-stall bathrooms from a menâ€™s and a womenâ€™s room to two unisex restrooms in the wake of the law. Both men said they see the law as government overreach, with the state usurping the power of cities.\nâ€œHe is grasping at straws because he is facing reelectionâ€? Haywood said of McCrory. â€œIf he backed off he would lose conservative support. Heâ€™s already lost moderate support.â€?\nHaywood said the law is â€œreflective of segregation, things weâ€™ve dealt with in the state poorly.â€?\nInside, Kyle Bleau, 24, and Keisha Riley, 36, sipped cocktails. Bleau, who is gay, said he can now be fired because of his sexual orientation.\nâ€œItâ€™s not just a bathroom issue,â€? he said. â€œItâ€™s an equality issue.â€?\nIt has also affected his summer plans:?He had tickets to see Demi Lovato and Nick Jonas, who said they will no longer come to North Carolina because of the law.\nRiley said she doesnâ€™t understand the argument that the law will protect young girls from predators;?she thinks bad people will find a way to do bad things, regardless of such a law. She is originally from New Jersey and said she was shocked that the law passed.\nâ€œIt kind of makes you feel like you are living in a different era, going back in time,â€? she said.\nRoberts said she has been inundated with messages and calls of support and opposition. She thinks the fight she is waging is one that will have a long-term effect.\nâ€œItâ€™s hard to see the endgame at this point, but if the endgame is that our whole country is going to?make forward progress on equality and inclusion, then that is some relief,â€? she said. â€œBut itâ€™s still very difficult.â€?\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post said that the dogwood is North Carolinaâ€™s state tree.

Pat McCrory (R) and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced dueling lawsuits regarding HB2, a law that requires people to use public restrooms according to the sex they were assigned at birth, rather than the one they identify with. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\nFrom the moment North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed that?controversial bathroom bill into law, he pretty much guaranteed its content would end up in court.\nNorth Carolina became the first (and so far only) state to restrict where transgender people can use public bathrooms and?locker rooms, and gay rights advocates almost immediately filed a lawsuit ?challenging the law's legality. Now the state is suing the government, and the government is suing the state . Basically, lawsuits all around.\nThe federal government says?the law violates federal civil rights ?laws?and ordered?North Carolina to get rid of it. North Carolina GOP officials argue there's no law that nulls theirs and announced Monday that? they're suing?the federal government for, in McCrory's words, "being a bully." By Monday afternoon, the Department of Justice countered with their own lawsuit trying to force McCrory's hands.\nIn other words,?there's no straight answer on whether North Carolina's law violates federal civil rights laws.?That's because?unlike other now-settled civil rights issues, the transgender rights debate?is still in its?infancy.\n"We've had a civil war and two constitutional amendments dealing with race, and we've had nothing dealing with transgender rights," said Greg Wallace, a law professor at Campbell University who doesn't think the law violates civil rights.\nBoth sides are pulling out?a litany of decades-old case law and regulations ? many of which did not directly deal with transgender issues ? to try to make their case. It gets really complicated really quickly, so we broke it down into four?(hopefully) easy-to-understand?arguments:\n1. Is it illegal to discriminate against transgender people in schools?\nLegal fights have broken out across the South over access to bathrooms for transgender men and women. Many times it is transgender students who are caught in the middle. (Reuters)\nYes, even this basic question isn't settled law.?More specifically, both sides are debating whether Title IX of the 1972?Education Amendments Act ? the federal law better known for prohibiting sex discrimination in schools and universities ? includes protections for gender identity. Here's what?each side says.\nYes, it is illegal\nThe Department of Justice and the Department of Education have said on multiple occasions that laws prohibiting sex discrimination should be read to extend to?transgender students.\n"Treating a student adversely because the sex assigned to him at birth does not match his gender identity is literally discrimination â€˜on the basis of sex,' " the Justice Department argued.\nMost recently, it? said a Chicago-area school district broke the law by banning a transgender student from the girls' locker room. And of course, the government now says says North Carolina's law is illegal. At least one federal court agrees; just last month, a Virginia federal appeals court ruled in favor of Virginia high school junior Gavin Grimm , saying he can sue his school board for discrimination because it banned him from the boys' bathroom. In making its decision, the court cited the Department of Education's interpretation of gender discrimination.\nNo, the law isn't clear\nThose rulings have all come directly from the Obama administration, which is stretching the law further than it was meant to go, supporters of the bathroom law say. North Carolina's?lawsuit claims the federal government has made "a baseless and blatant overreach" in trying to void the state's bathroom law.\nWhy??Because when Title IX was written, it explicitly said that having separate bathrooms and locker rooms for men and women is not discrimination. The way the Obama administration is reading the law, some observers think private health clubs and gyms might?also have to open up their bathrooms to transgender people.\n"The Justice Department is making law for the federal government as opposed to enforcing it," McCrory told Fox News on Sunday.\nPlus, nine federal judges in three circuit courts and two district courts have rejected arguments like the one the DOJ is making that it's illegal to ban transgender students from bathrooms and locker rooms,?Wallace said.\n2. Is it illegal to discriminate against transgender people in the workplace?\nNorth Carolina's law also stopped cities from passing their own anti-discrimination ordinances to protect gay and transgender people, which opponents argue could have repercussions well beyond bathroom stalls. And they're seizing on that to make another case for why North Carolina's law is illegal. The Department of Justice said North Carolina is specifically violating Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in discriminating against transgender people.\nYes, it's illegal\nIn 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that you can't fire someone for not acting like their gender ? say, if a law firm fires?a woman for acting too macho or fires a man for acting too feminine. It's known as gender stereotyping, and the Supreme Court made clear it's sex discrimination.\nThat case did not deal with transgender people, but opponents of bathroom laws say it's easy to connect the dots today . Indeed, at least two federal courts already have, in ruling that civil rights laws could apply to a claim brought by a fired transgender woman who thought he or she was unfairly fired.\nThe law says no, it's not (for now)\nWith this law, North Carolina is now squarely in the majority of state non-discrimination laws, supporters say. North Carolina? is one of at least 30 states that does not include discrimination protections for gender identity, whether in public places, in housing or in the workplace.\nAnd once again, the case law on this is unclear. Older court cases say there are no laws written to?explicitly?protect transgender people from discrimination. If Congress wants a new law for to explicitly protect transgender people from discrimination at the workplace, in housing, in the pizza joint, in the bathroom, etc., it will have to write it. And that hasn't happened yet.\n3. Does allowing transgender people into bathrooms violate people's privacy (and vice-versa)?\nAt a rally in Frederick, Md., GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz panned rival Donald Trump's opposition to a North Carolina bill prohibiting transgender people from using bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. Cruz asked the crowd, "Have we gone stark raving nuts?" (Reuters)\nAt its heart, North Carolina's law is aimed at protecting?privacy and how to balance people's expectation of it with equality. Both sides say their privacy is violated in this bathroom debate, but for very different reasons.\nYes, opening up bathrooms violates people's privacy\nLost in the furor over this law, say its supporters, is how NOT writing it would have allowed municipalities like Charlotte, N.C., to violate everyday Americans' privacy.\n"If transgender persons are given the legal right to use facilities of their choice, non-transgender persons will be required to disrobe, shower and perform personal bodily functions in the presence of those with intimate body parts different from their own," Wallace wrote in an op-ed for North Carolina's News & Observer. He?argued that the law actually balances privacy rights by allowing schools and government offices to make reasonable accommodations for transgender people, like providing them with a single-use bathroom.\nPlus, once again, case law on this is unclear. (Sensing a theme here?)\nYes, closing bathrooms to transgender people violates their privacy\nWhen done correctly,?laws allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with shouldn't even cause a ripple in people's daily lives. Female students won't even know they're showering with a transgender female, for example, if that girl is treated like any other student, say LGBT advocates.\nIt's when you start forcing transgender students to use a different bathroom that their privacy gets violated, they say. Transgender students will have to essentially out themselves by suddenly using a different bathroom. It would force them to share private medical information against their will and, perhaps more damaging, open?themselves up to bullying and violence.\n"These are not hypothetical abstract fears," Tara Borelli, a lawyer with Lambda Legal who is involved in a lawsuit challenging the law, told The Fix recently , citing two clients in the lawsuit who say they were bullied for being forced to use a different restroom. Because they are so different, transgender people are some of the most vulnerable people in our society to bullying, violence, depression and suicide, say LGBT advocates.\n16-year-old student Amy Joyner-Francis died after being beaten in a fight that broke out among several female students at Howard High School of Technology in Wilmington, Del. (Reuters)\n4.?What even is a transgender person?\nThis is by far the trickiest question
 to answer?in this debate, but it could be a central one the courts address because?proponents of North Carolina's law are bringing this question up in their defense of it.\n"It's very hard to define transgender or gender identity," McCrory has argued. He says Congress has not defined "sex" as something that can be chosen.\nWho gets to define who's a woman and who's a man? Is it a personal decision? A certain number of years of hormone therapy? Gender-reassignment surgery? (North Carolina's law says it's what your birth certificate lists, which is possible but difficult to change.)?Supporters of the North Carolina law say this?ambiguity allows predators in disguise to easily slip through the cracks ? and into a restroom.\nOpponents of North Carolina's law say McCrory and others are manufacturing fear on baseless claims ? and they emphasize that transgender students are some of the most vulnerable students in America's school system, not the other way around.\nCorrection: This post originally misidentified the law Title IX, which deals with sex discrimination in federal education funding, is from.

There just hasn't been a ton of public polling on this.\nNow we have a better idea. And it's not good news for supporters of what North Carolina Republicans are doing.\nA CNN/ORC poll released Monday found a majority of Americans (57 percent) don't agree with bathroom bills like the one North Carolina is defending that restrict?where transgender people can use the bathroom, while 38 percent do.\nAs usual with contentious issues, there's a partisan trend. People tend to agree with their political leaders on this:\nBut notice that last number. Almost half of Republicans are opposed to laws requiring transgender people to use the bathroom on their birth certificates. In fact, according to the CNN poll, Republicans are actually split 48-48 about whether to support?these bills.\nIf Republicans are indeed split?in their support for bathroom bills, it's in stark contrast to the news in recent days . In North Carolina, the epicenter of these bathroom debates, GOP??leaders are digging in their heels to defend it, betting voters will back them up in November. They just sued the federal government to try to keep it on the books. (The government counter-sued.)\nSocially conservative North Carolina may be in a slightly different political situation than the rest of the nation. A recent Elon University poll showed 49 percent of all North Carolina voters agreed with the law's aim to stop cities from passing ordinances that open up bathrooms to transgender people; but that same poll showed Gov. Pat McCrory's (R) Democratic opponent with his biggest lead yet in the tight race.\n[ The legal fight over North Carolina's transgender bathroom law, explained in 4 questions ]\nThis is one of those issues where it's easy to slice and dice the numbers to make your case that you are doing the popular thing. Americans'?-- and particularly Republicans' -- support for bathroom bills might depend how you frame the question. As we saw in Houston in November, opponents of an LGBT non-discrimination ordinance overwhelmingly?defeated it by framing the issue about bathrooms, specifically the predators who might exploit an open-door policy.\nThis CNN poll was more straightforward, if not a bit confusing. It asked whether people support laws requiring transgender individuals to use facilities that do not correspond to their gender identity (i.e. requiring transgender people to use the bathroom they may not normally use).\nThe answer may also depend on who's going to the bathroom. A CBS poll in 2014 found the exact opposite result when asking about school-aged transgender children and what bathroom they should use. Fifty-nine percent of respondents said the children should use the bathroom of the gender of their birth. Let's not forget that this bathroom bill debate is as much about adults as it is children; several recent lawsuits and flash points have centered on?which locker rooms?transgender students?can use.\nBut on the whole, this poll is positive for transgender advocates. And there is more good news: Americans' support for opening up bathrooms (and Republicans' indecision) appears to be happening without one of the driving forces in the gay marriage debate -- a familiarity with the LGBT group involved. Eighty-five percent of respondents told CNN they don't have a friend or family member who is transgender.\nThe first major national poll on transgender adults in bathrooms would suggest the nation is leaning toward allowing them into bathrooms -- without even getting to know them first. That's pretty remarkable. As we've documented, Americans' familiarity with gay people in their personal lives was a huge contributing factor in reshaping public opinion over gay rights in favor of same-sex marriage so quickly.\nClearly, there's still a lot we don't know/a lot that isn't settled about public opinion in the bathroom debate. But the initial results look promising for LGBT advocates, who hope to convince the greater public there's no real danger to opening up?their bathrooms and locker rooms to trangender people. This poll suggests Americans might be amenable to that argument.\npolitics\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

French Prime Minister Manuel Valls?announced Monday afternoon.\nSpecific details of the plan remain unclear, but the general emphasis of the French governmentâ€™s so-called Action Plan Against Radicalization and Terrorism is to strengthen the ability of local authorities to catch young people before they become radicalized.\nâ€œEach epoch has its challenges,â€? Valls wrote on Twitter. â€œThe fight against jihadism is the great challenge of our generation.â€?\nThis is especially true in France:?2015 began with the attacks on the office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo?and a kosher supermarket outside Paris that killed 12; it ended with the Nov.?13 attacks on a stadium, a concert hall, and a number?of cafes across the French capital that killed 130.\nVallsâ€™s announcement is an indication that the French government identifies these instances as evidence of an internal, structural problem.\nBoth of those attacks last year?were perpetrated by young men under age 35 who were either French or Francophone European Union?citizens.\nSimilarly, the Brussels attacks in March ? which killed 32 in an assault on the cityâ€™s international airport and a subway station near the headquarters of the European Union ? were carried out by the same cell of militants?who orchestrated the November attacks.\nThat cell was technically based in Brussels but had deep ties to France and its culture. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for each attack.\nAs William McCants and Christopher Meserole, two fellows at the Brookings Institution, concluded in a study released after the Brussels attacks, the single greatest predictor of foreign-fighter radicalization was a country's connection to French political culture ??not its wealth or education levels.\nâ€œInstead, the top predictor was whether a country was Francophone,â€? the two wrote, â€œthat is, whether it currently lists (or previously listed) French as a national language.â€?\nIn the study, the French language is seen as a stand-in for French political culture, a sensibility â€œmore aggressiveâ€? on the question of state secularism, which many Muslims find alienating.\nBesides bolstering efforts to stop French youths from affiliating with militant?groups, Valls announced Monday that the government will also bolster its security apparatus. Specifically, it will create about?8,500 jobs for more police officers, customs officials and prison guards.\nThe French government is likely to spend about?40 million euros on these initiatives by 2018. The newspaper Le Monde reported that the first of the rehabilitation centers could be open as soon as this summer.\nRead more:\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Jonathan Drake/Reuters\nBy Arelis R. HernÃ¡ndez and Renae Merle October 8 at 9:39 PM Follow @arelisrhdz Follow @renaemerle\nFLAGLER BEACH, Fla. ? Hurricane Matthew reduced Floridaâ€™s scenic Atlantic Coast Highway ? the economic lifeline of the stateâ€™s small beach towns ? to an impassable pile of concrete and asphalt rubble after the powerful storm surge washed away sand dunes and earth supporting the roadway.\nLarge chunks of the northbound lanes tumbled and caved into the beach below, causing local law enforcement to shut access to about six miles of A1A. While most of the state, which reported four storm-related deaths, escaped the most dire predictions of the hurricaneâ€™s potential wreckage, it left many communities along a 35-mile strip of the northeast coast in shambles.\nâ€œIt looks like a war-torn area,â€? said Patti King, whose home is just a few blocks from one damaged stretch of the highway. â€œItâ€™s shocking. Entire parts of the road buckled and fell into the sand. Most of the homes survived, but the road didnâ€™t.â€?\nFrom Flagler Beach, a tiny town known for its pristine, unobstructed views of the ocean, to St. Augustine, which claims the distinction of being Americaâ€™s oldest city, Matthew ripped power lines and large oak trees out of the ground and flooded neighborhoods. On Vilano Beach, houses collapsed onto the beach, according to a city official.\nNo community may have been more affected than Flagler Beach. The close-knit town of classic cinder-block houses has successfully fought commercial development to preserve the mom-and-pop restaurants and shops that give it the â€œOld-Florida vibeâ€? lost in other places. But developers are not a Category?4 hurricane, which this part of Florida had not seen in decades.\nHurricane Matthew knocked down trees and flooded roads in parts of Georgia and South Carolina as it continued its trek north along the Atlantic coast. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\nStructurally, most of the townâ€™s homes and businesses fared well, save a few roof shingles and toppled fences. The beach, however, was destroyed. The dunes, the walkways, the right of way and nearly half of the roadway ? gone.\nAfter the storm passed, authorities soon realized the highway was gone, too. The state had recently reinforced parts of the roadway, but they were swept away by the force of wind and water.\nâ€œItâ€™s going to be a lot of work,â€? said Jim Troiano, spokesman for the Flagler County Sheriffâ€™s Office, as he surveyed the damage along A1A on Saturday.\nFlorida National Guardsmen were stationed at the border of Flagler and Volusia counties to keep traffic from trying to navigate the unstable road. Frustrated residents attempted to negotiate their way home only to be devastated by what they saw.\nâ€œThis is pure heartbreak,â€? Flagler Beach resident Amy Glenn said. â€œThe ocean can wash away our beaches and roads but not our memories.â€?\nNurse Terri Brendle said she had â€œnever seen anything like it.â€?\nNext weekend is Biketoberfest, a huge motorcycle rally in Floridaâ€™s coastal towns that typically draws tens of thousands of bikers. With the A1A closed through this stretch, traffic will have to be diverted.\nâ€œWe are going to lose a lot of business,â€? said Tony Lulgjuraj, who owns a local business with his brother. State officials said repairing and fortifying the roadway could take months.\nFarther north along A1A is Crescent Beach, which sits on a narrow strip of land with the ocean on one side and the Mantanzas River on the other. Some homes there flooded with more than three feet of water. On one lot, only the stilts remained.\nIn the Summer Haven neighborhood, the hurricane tossed around heavy boulders put in place a few years ago to reinforce an old road in the area. Some ended up in residentsâ€™ yards.\nâ€œIt was a solid mass of water and foam and debris. I saw pieces of the old highway float by,â€? said Bill Meeler, who watched the storm from his beachside home.\nThen there was the Hut, a popular beach house that dates to the 1800s. The storm ripped away parts of its front, toppling a coquina stone fireplace and fully exposing the claw-foot tub.\nâ€œMy heart is breaking. This was my childhood stomping ground,â€? said Liz Bennett, who had come to check on her motherâ€™s property nearby.\nStill farther north, in St. Augustine, four National Guard troopers in camouflage and with rifles slung over their shoulders blocked cars from driving across the Bridge of Lions from the historic downtown to the barrier islands there. Some residents walked or biked across the bridge, surfboards under their arms.\nAs of Saturday evening, there was no power or sewage service, and some parts of the city lacked water service, Mayor Nancy Shaver said. The city suffered significant damage, but it would have been worse if not for a 20-mile shift in Matthewâ€™s path out to sea as it neared St. Augustine, she said.\nâ€œWe will make them shine again,â€? she said of the City Hall building and a historic church. â€œWe are 451 years old. We expect to get to 452.â€?\nMeanwhile, just a few miles away, there was another kind of damage assessment underway.\nFirst United Methodist Church ships hundreds of pumpkins in from New Mexico every year for its annual youth-group fundraiser. But the storm scattered the stockpile over several blocks. Some pumpkins rested in the parking lot of the burger restaurant down the street, while others were discovered badly scabbed and broken at a nearby gas station.\nâ€œThey just floated away,â€? said Lauren Birkhimer, 17.\nAbout a quarter of the pumpkins are believed to be lost forever, while others may be too damaged to be sold, group members said. â€œWeâ€™re still assessing the damage,â€? said Birkhimer, the co-president of the youth group. â€œItâ€™s our biggest fundraiser of the year.â€?\nSusan Cooper Eastman in St. Augustine and Lacey McLaughlin in Daytona Beach contributed to this report.\nbusiness\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Greg Gibson/AP)\nCan former vice president Al Gore, who hasnâ€™t been on the ballot in a decade and a half, persuade young voters to back Hillary Clinton by appearing in hurricane-battered South Florida?\nHe and the Democratic presidential nominee will start testing this proposition on Tuesday, when the two appear together in Miami.\nThe location has plenty of symbolic importance ? the area has?not only just been battered by Hurricane Matthew, it is also a part of the country most vulnerable to sea-level rise and the state where Green Party candidate Ralph Nader helped derail Goreâ€™s 2000 presidential candidacy.\n[ For millennial voters, the Clinton vs. Trump choice â€˜feels like a jokeâ€™ ]\nThe appearance is timed to coincide with the stateâ€™s voter registration deadline, and the Clinton campaign announced Sunday that the two politicians would urge Florida voters â€œto check their registration status and to get registered by?October 11?to make their voices heard this election.â€?\nGoreâ€™s pitch: People?concerned about climate change, especially young voters,?should ignore the siren song of third-party candidates and opt for Clinton. Millennials are a key target demographic for Clinton, because they consider tackling global warming a higher priority than older voters but have yet to fully embrace her.\nâ€œAt the event, Gore will discuss the urgent threat posed by climate change and lay out the high stakes of Novemberâ€™s election,â€? the Clinton campaign said in a statement.\n[ A brief history of Donald Trumpâ€™s denialist position on climate change ]\nGore spokeswoman Betsy McManus said Sunday in an email that the former vice president would emphasize the stark?differences between Clinton and?GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has questioned the link between human activity and climate change.\nâ€œFor those who agree that we must solve the climate crisis, the choice is clear in this election ? and VP Gore is looking forward to joining Secretary Clinton in Miami to talk with Florida voters about how we solve this challenge,â€? she wrote.\n[ Why Al Gore and Hillary Clinton are burying the hatchet this election ]\nMany Republicans ? and some Democrats ? wonder whether Gore can actually mobilize young voters. Conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt mocked the idea last week ? a couple of days before he called for Trump to step aside???noting that many South Park fans are more familiar with the comic â€œManBearPigâ€? episode mocking?Gore as an alarmist than with Gore?as a political figure.\nSo @algore is coming to help @HillaryClinton w/ millennials?

Some 1.5 million Floridians were placed under evacuation last week as the Category 4 hurricane bore down on the stateâ€™s coast, closing down county and state government services.\nAfter Gov. Rick Scott (R) refused to extend Tuesdayâ€™s deadline to register, a federal judge ruled against him, extending it at least until Wednesday and rebuking Scottâ€™s decision as â€œirrational,â€? â€œnonsensicalâ€? and â€œpoppycock.â€?\nâ€œThese voters have already had their lives (and, quite possibly, their homes) turned up-side down by Hurricane Matthew,â€? U.S. District Judge Mark E. Walker wrote. â€œThey deserve a break, especially one that is mandated by the United States Constitution.â€?\n[How big storms can affect big elections]\nEven as he was pleading desperately for people to flee Matthew, Scott steadfastly refused to extend the voter registration deadline. On Sunday, the Florida Democratic Party filed a lawsuit asking the federal courts to intervene before the deadline passed.\nLeaders in other states hard hit by the storm have taken steps to minimize the effect on voting. In South Carolina, Gov. Nikki Haley (R) has extended the stateâ€™s registration deadline to allow paperwork to be postmarked by Tuesday.\nAnd in Georgia, voters can register electronically, an option not available to Florida residents.\nIn North Carolina, where saturated rivers are forcing thousands from their homes, newly restored rules that were nearly taken away by Republicans will allow voters who miss the deadline to register during early voting.\nBut with many of that stateâ€™s eastern counties struggling with still-rising floodwaters, it remains unclear what effect the storm could have on polling places and displaced residents. The North Carolina State Board of Elections said Monday it was still trying to assess possible damage and effects.\n[Thousands plucked from rising floodwaters in North Carolina]\nIn 2012, when Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New Jersey in the week before the presidential election, it hindered voters. According to a study by Robert M. Stein of Rice University, voter turnout decreased by 2.8 percent in affected counties, and there were also fewer polling places available.\nIn the crucial swing state of Florida, where polls have shown Democrat Hillary Clinton slightly ahead of Republican Donald Trump but within the margin of error, voting rights activists, legal experts and Democrats have accused Scott of taking political advantage of the storm to prevent residents still reeling from the hurricane from voting.\nâ€œYou shouldnâ€™t have to choose between your physical safety and your right to vote,â€? said Myrna PÃ©rez, deputy director of the Brennan Centerâ€™s Democracy Program. â€œItâ€™s something you would think would have bipartisan support.â€?\nScott, chairman of the super PAC supporting Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign, explained his decision last week before the hurricane hit, saying, â€œEverybody has had a lot of time to register. On top of that, weâ€™ve got lots of opportunities to vote: early voting, absentee voting and Election Day. So, I donâ€™t intend to make any changes.â€?\nWhen pressed by reporters, Scott said, â€œLook, this is, this is politics.â€?\nAt stake are a sizeable number of potential votes. In the 2012 election, during the last five days before the deadline, 104,351 Floridians registered to vote, said Daniel Smith, a University of Florida political scientist.\nâ€œThe number increases as you get closer to the deadline,â€? he said. â€œPeople procrastinate. They wait until the last minute to register.â€?\nOf those last-minute registerations in 2012, 40 percent were Democrats compared with 21 percent Republicans. And a disproportionate number were minorities, he said.\nBut Smith and others point out other factors that make it less clear if Republicans would gain any substantial advantage by refusing to extend the registration deadline. Of those who registered at the last minute in 2012, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to cast a ballot afterward.\nOthers point out that many of the Florida counties hit hardest by Hurricane Matthew lean Republicans.\nâ€œThatâ€™s why I find the whole thing so surprising,â€? said Perez. â€œIâ€™m not hearing a good defense for why he doesnâ€™t do this.â€?\nIn their lawsuit on Sunday, Floridaâ€™s Democrats pointed out how aggressively Scott appealed to voters to evacuate, telling them, â€œThis storm will kill you. Time is running out.â€? But on the same day he made those appeals, Scott announced that the registration deadline would not be extended.\nLeading up to the hurricaneâ€™s arrival, voting activists noted, post offices and county offices were closed. Many residents either evacuated or holed up in their homes. And in its wake, roads have been flooded and many residents have lost power.\nScottâ€™s staff did not answer questions emailed to his office, but pointed to voting legislation signed by Scott and recent statements in which he said he wanted â€œ100 percent participation.â€?\nScott spokeswoman Lauren Schenone said that at an event Monday, the governor discussed â€œthat it is very important people have the opportunity to vote. He also mentioned that people still have time to register and should do so over the next few days.â€?\nExacerbating the situation is that unlike other states, Florida does not offer same-day registration. Nor does it offer online registration.\nIn their lawsuit, the Democrats raised constitutional objections as well as claims that Scottâ€™s actions violate the Voting Rights Act because they could disporportionately affect minorities.\nIn his order Monday granting a temporary extension, the judge said there is no reason Florida could not extend its deadline when other states have done the same.\nâ€œIf aspiring eligible Florida voters are barred from registering to vote, then those voters are stripped of one of our most precious freedoms,â€? Walker said.\nnational\nNews and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11.\npost_newsletter353\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\nI guess Hillary Clinton performed marginally better than Donald Trump in last nightâ€™s debate . It wasnâ€™t a disaster for Trump, but the absence of disaster isnâ€™t enough. The real question for him is whether he gained any new votes. And for that matter, what has Trump done in the past two weeks to win over any new supporters? Are there any suburban women who support him today who didnâ€™t support him last month? I doubt it.\nAs former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour says, â€œPolitics is all about addition.â€? So what is the net effect for Trump? Does he gain any votes by attacking the Republicans who have defected from him, or is he only hardening the Republican opposition that has galvanized against him in the past week? It seems counterintuitive to believe that attacking traditional GOP voters will result in more votes in November.\nAnyway, at this point, is Trump even trying to win? Or, knowing that heâ€™s going to lose, does he want to blow up in dramatic fashion so he can blame others for his loss? I think the latter has become part of the Trump campaign equation.\nThe big question today for Republicans is not whether Trump can win, but how he might lose. Does he lose with 46 percent or 48 percent of the vote, or does he lose in a massive landslide? We could be about to see a perfect storm for Republicans in November, where disgusted Republican suburbanites decide they canâ€™t vote for the ogre Trump and simply donâ€™t turn out to vote at all, while core Trump supporters who are angry and feel abandoned by the â€œmainstreamâ€? GOP refuse to vote for any down-ballot Republicans. This would be a double-whammy for Republicans. If youâ€™re a worrier like me and you want something to worry about, there you have it.\nopinions\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(The Washington Post)\nWe have seen the Republican grown-ups who should know better ? House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, especially ? lose their intellectual and moral center, confusing party loyalty with honor. Pols such as Ryan and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) knew enough to express horror at Donald Trumpâ€™s boasts about sexual assault ? or pretend to be horrified. But they remain in Trumpâ€™s camp. A wanna be sexual predator is fit for the presidency. Thatâ€™s what they are saying. They are not mentally unhinged narcissists, they are simply men of weak character and exceptional hypocrisy.\nBut next to Trump, there is no more reprehensible creature in all this than Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Heâ€™d like us to think he is a devout Christian. He nevertheless lies over and over again when Trumpâ€™s words are read back to him. Today he defends Trumpâ€™s slimy attacks on Bill Clinton, the nadir of presidential politics. He insists Martha Raddatz mischaracterized his Syria remarks which Trump rebuked. Thatâ€™s a lie, too.\nHere is what she said:\nHe said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in airstrikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.\nHere is what Pence said :\nBut about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen.\nAnd secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.\nItâ€™s not clear how she could have been any more accurate, Again, Pence is flat-out lying.\nPence responded, as did Ryan and others, with horror when Trumpâ€™s â€œAccess Hollywoodâ€? video was revealed. He pointedly would not reaffirm his support for Trump over the weekend. He would not go to a rally on his behalf. But, believing Trump was not as awful as he might have been, Pence is back singing his praises today. He thinks Trumpâ€™s threat to put Hillary Clinton in jail was a debate highlight. This is a man of deep cynicism and defective character.\nPence should run as the GOP nominee in 2020. But center-right conservatives shouldnâ€™t be in the GOP by then. They must and, we think, will walk away.\nThe GOP glorifies ignorance and dishonesty, touting Pence as a hero of some sort. He is not an unhinged ignoramus like Trump. No, Pence knows better and surely knows what he is doing. He had the power to walk away, putting a stake through Trumpâ€™s campaign and saving the GOPâ€™s soul. He didnâ€™t. He and the GOP deserve one another; center-right voters and the country deserve a new party.\nopinions\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

So he's going to save himself. The rest of Republicans in Congress are?welcome to come along with him.\nIn a meeting with House Republican members on Monday morning, the House speaker? said he's done defending and campaigning for the Republican presidential nominee and will be focused on House and Senate races only.\nRyan told House Rs he's "only campaigning for House seats and promoting our agenda" & won't talk about or defend Trump, @pkcapitol reports.\n? Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) October 10, 2016\nIt's as clear of a break-up as you'll see in presidential politics -- at least from Ryan's perspective. Trump, for one, isn't necessarily thrilled.?But it's not without risk.\nPaul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee\n? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2016\nRyan calculated that after Trump's 2005 leaked comments groping women and his all-hell-breaks-loose debate performance Sunday night, Trump is toast.\nAnd that could be a big problem for Ryan: If Trump loses by double digits -- no one really knows exactly where that magic line is -- most observers think Republicans on the ballot with him will go down too. There simply aren't enough Hillary Clinton voters who will cross party lines and vote for Republicans to make up for a 10-point Trump loss.\nThe battle for control of the Senate is already a nail biter , and if Trump loses by big enough margins, Ryan's historically large majority in the House of Representatives could go down with Trump too. .\nSo Ryan is going all in to try to save himself and his party's?congressional majority.\nWe haven't seen something quite like this happen in presidential politics since 1996, when congressional Republicans ditched nominee Bob Dole in the final weeks before the election.\nBut there's a big difference between then and now: Dole and his supporters accepted the shift?quietly. It's almost guaranteed Trump and his supporters won't. And that could be a big problem for congressional Republicans who need the party's base of core supporters to win in tight races.\nWe're already seeing that dynamic play out. On?Saturday, four vulnerable Senate Republican candidates reversed their support for him and said they couldn't vote for him. But one, Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nev.), got booed, when he said it.\nTrump's performance Sunday didn't make life easier for Republicans who want to avoid a backlash: Trump did well enough to satisfy his base, but not well enough to win over any new voters.\nSpeaking of which, there's no guarantee that ditching Trump now will help win over skeptical voters.\nAs I wrote Saturday :\nMany independent and GOP voters ? especially white women ? have been turned off by Trump for months now. Senate Republicans will have to figure out a way to answer this question from voters: Why is hearing Trump's self-described â€œlocker room banterâ€? more than a decade ago any more offensive than when he suggested banning Muslims from the country, or when he accused a federal judge or not being able to do his job because of his â€œMexicanâ€? heritage?\nAfter each of those gasp-inducing comments from Trump, these Republican candidates maintained they would still be voting for Trump.

Ryan (Wis.) cut Donald Trump loose in an emergency maneuver to preserve the partyâ€™s endangered congressional majorities.\nRyanâ€™s announcement that he would no longer defend or campaign with Trump prompted biting condemnations from within his caucus and from Trump himself, who publicly lashed out at the speaker.\nIt was an extraordinary display of personal animus just four weeks before the election, destroying any semblance of party unity behind a nominee who many GOP leaders said they could no longer stomach because of his character traits and tawdry campaign tactics.\nNew national and battleground-state polls showed Trump sliding since Fridayâ€™s publication of a 2005 video of him bragging about sexual assault, putting Clinton in position for a possible electoral landslide. Clinton surged to an 11 percentage point lead nationally in an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll conducted over the weekend.\nâ€œItâ€™s every person for himself or herself right now,â€? former senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) said. â€œThe nominee for president is so destructive to everyday Republicans.â€?\nPaul Ryan told a crowd at a fall festival in Wisconsin that there was a â€œtroublingâ€? "elephant in the room,â€? after the Washington Post revealed a 2005 recording of Trump speaking in very lewd terms about women. (The Washington Post)\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus pledged complete fidelity to Trump in a conference call with RNC members and denied rumors that the national party was redirecting its resources to down-ballot races, according to a person on the call.\n[ Paul Ryan wonâ€™t defend or campaign for Trump ahead of election ]\nWith Republicans at war amongst themselves, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton moved swiftly Monday to pry away moderate Republican-leaning voters who are turned off by Trump. Her campaign launched an advertising blitz featuring testimonials from ordinary Republicans explaining why they were voting for Clinton.\nâ€œShe is reaching out to voters that may well have supported Mitt Romney in 2012 and in a normal year might also be inclined to support the Republican nominee but are so troubled by Donald Trump they are open to supporting Hillary Clinton,â€? Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said. He added that nasty personal attacks by Trump at Sundayâ€™s second presidential debate in St. Louis â€œonly helped us close the sale.â€?\nRyanâ€™s move, announced on a contentious conference call with House GOP members, was seen as a concession that Trump could no longer win the presidency and that the party must devote itself to retaining its majorities in the House and Senate.\nUnlike Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was rendered mute on the subject Monday. He told a business group in Kentucky that if they wanted to hear his thoughts on Trump, they â€œmight as well go ahead and leave,â€? according to the Associated Press.\nStill, there was no wave of defections Monday from Trump, who in an aggressive performance in Sunday nightâ€™s debate reassured the conservative base that he would be a relentless aggressor against the partyâ€™s shared enemies: Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton. Trump leveled a stream of harsh charges at Hillary Clinton during the event, claiming she attacked women who accused her husband of sexual abuse and promising to send the former secretary of state to jail if he is president.\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that if he continues to be criticized over lewd comments made in a 2005 taping with Access Hollywood, or if more comments are released, he will continue to attack former president Bill Clinton about his past sex scandals, on Oct. 10 at a rally in Ambridge, Pa. (The Washington Post)\nâ€œTheyâ€™ve really raised the ante on Republicans who want to cut and run,â€? said former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a Trump ally. â€œHow can you have watched that debate without knowing he won?â€?\n[ Second presidential debate takes the low road as attacks and slurs dominate ]\nOne important conservative who was enthused was Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the vice-presidential nominee, who made clear Monday that he would be loyal soldier even as their campaign took a dark turn.\nCampaigning in Charlotte, Pence said that he does not condone what Trump said in the 2005 video, but that as a man of faith â€œI believe in forgiveness.â€?\nTrump, he added, â€œshowed the American people whatâ€™s in his heart. He showed humility to the American people and then he fought back and turned the focus to the choice that we face, and Iâ€™m proud to stand with Donald Trump.â€?\nBut Democrats insisted that Trumpâ€™s lewd comments and description of predatory behavior in the video would haunt him for the remainder of the campaign.\nâ€œItâ€™s not behind him,â€? said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). â€œNo. I guarantee you. Women do not forget being talked about that way, because all women have had a man in their life who has been in a position of power that has treated them without respect.â€?\nMany Republican elected officials felt paralyzed Monday, disgusted with Trumpâ€™s candidacy but afraid to withdraw their endorsements and feel the wrath of his supporters. The situation was most precarious for politicians in battleground states such as Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, who can save their seats only if they get votes from the most fervent Trump supporters as well as moderates uneasy about him.\nRep. Greg Walden (Ore.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told House members on the conference call with Ryan that navigating the election was now like â€œlanding an airplane in a hurricane,â€? according to a lawmaker on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.\nTrump is exacerbating the tensions by rebuking any Republican who betrays him and using the party leadership as a foil. Trump tweeted on Sunday: â€œSo many self-righteous hypocrites. Watch their poll numbers ? and elections ? go down!â€?\nTrumpâ€™s high command is keeping track of Republicans who break from the nominee. As he climbed into a waiting SUV late Sunday in St. Louis with other Trump advisers, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani coolly said that Trump â€œwill rememberâ€? who was with him and who was not ? and vowed that the outsider candidate would win the White House irrespective of the party leadersâ€™ wishes.\nOn Monday, Ryan was at the center of the GOPâ€™s existential crisis. The norms and ideological orthodoxy that have shaped his career no longer define the party or provide him with the means of counterbalancing Trump. So instead of directly confronting Trump, Ryan sought a middle ground by personally backing away from Trump without rescinding his endorsement.\n[ A generation of GOP stars may be diminished: â€˜Everything Trump touches diesâ€™ ]\nOn the call, Ryan instructed fellow House Republicans to make their own calculations about Trump based on the politics of their districts. The speaker was challenged by at least a half-dozen members, from California to Ohio, who bristled at any attempt to distance the party from Trump, people on the call said.\nâ€œHe got huge pushback like Iâ€™ve never seen before from members from across the country just saying that was the wrong move ? and even if it cost them the House,â€? said one lawmaker on the call, who, as others who were interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the private discussion.\nLate in the call, Ryan got back on the line to respond to the criticism by assuring his conference that he would not take back his endorsement, though that offered little assurance to the pro-Trump contingent.\nTrump publicly chastised the speaker, tweeting , â€œPaul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee.â€?\nRep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), who has called on Trump to step aside, vented his frustrations in an interview. â€œI for one am getting a little tired of being told that I have to fall in line and behave,â€? Dent said. â€œIâ€™m not the one making all these outlandish and incendiary comments. People should stop screaming at the firefighters.â€?\nTrump has done little to put the fire out. He and his campaign have fully committed to a final month of harsh combat by airing allegations of sexual assault by Bill Clinton.\nFollowing Sundayâ€™s debate, Omarosa Manigault, Trumpâ€™s African American outreach director, brought up Clintonâ€™s affair with Monica Lewinsky to reporters and accused the 42nd president and his wife of having â€œpreyed on this internâ€? and â€œdestroyed her as a human being.â€?\nâ€œThis is not a couple you want in the White House,â€? Manigault said. â€œPeople say, â€˜Oh, Hillaryâ€™s separate from her husband.â€™ But if you get Hillary in the White House, you also get Bill, and Lord have mercy on us if we have to go through four more years of that.â€?\nThis approach is galvanizing Trumpâ€™s grass-roots supporters. Steven Mnuchin, Trumpâ€™s national finance chairman, said the campaign received â€œa big surgeâ€? of small-dollar donations and positive feedback from the debate.\nâ€œIâ€™m getting calls all day from people who want to come to the Vegas debate and want the excitement of what people expect will be another great debate,â€? Mnuchin said, referring to the Oct.?19 debate in Las Vegas.\nOn
 the stump Monday in Ambridge, Pa., Trump broadened the scope of his critique to taint the entire Democratic Party as sordid, recounting the late senator Edward M. Kennedyâ€™s 1969 car crash that killed a 28-year-old woman on Chappaquiddick Island, Mass.\nTrumpâ€™s blistering method is being orchestrated by Stephen K. Bannon, the campaignâ€™s chief executive and former head of the acerbic conservative website Breitbart, who has become a near-omnipresent counselor at Trumpâ€™s side. He has urged Trump not to worry about any cleavage in party ranks and instead to target Clinton.\nFor her part, Clinton seized on Trumpâ€™s negativity as a way to taunt him and argue that he is unfit to be president.\nâ€œDonald Trump spent his time attacking when he should have been apologizing,â€? Clinton said in Detroit in reference to the debate. â€œNow, there are a lot of things he should apologize for, right?â€?\nMike DeBonis, Juliet Eilperin, Paul Kane, Kelsey Snell and Karen Tumulty contributed to this report.\npolitics\nNews and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11.\npost_newsletter353\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(The Washington Post)\nBy Jenna Johnson October 10 at 7:38 PM Follow @wpjenna\nAMBRIDGE, Pa. ? The morning after the vice-presidential debate, Cathy Frasca woke at 5 a.m. and hand-wrote a four-page letter to Donald Trump that said: â€œIt is obvious that you could easily lose this election.â€?\nThe 89-year-old grandmother urged Trump to release his taxes, ignore the controversies that Hillary Clinton tries to start, stop tweeting at 3 a.m. and remember that â€œBill Clinton is not running for election, so please avoid using precious time to discuss his sex life.â€? Instead, Frasca wrote, Trump should tell voters about how he will improve the country.\nâ€œYou know what to do but time is running out,â€? she wrote in closing. â€œMy prayers are with you always.â€?\nAs Trump bounces from one controversy to another and Hillary Clinton gains in the polls, there is a growing realization among some of his most devoted supporters that he could lose the election. They still hope he will win, as the idea of another President Clinton angers and scares them. They blame the Republican Party for not doing enough to support its nominee, the media for focusing on comments Trump made years ago and Democrats who, they say, rigged the system. But they also place a little blame on Trump.\nAs Frasca watched the second presidential debate Sunday night, she was glad to see that Trump seemed better prepared and that he apologized for his â€œtoilet talkâ€? in 2005 when he told an â€œAccess Hollywoodâ€? host that he could grope women and force himself on them sexually because he was famous. She was delighted to hear Trump tell Clinton that she should be in jail, but she didnâ€™t understand why he dragged along women who have accused former president Bill Clinton of sexual assault or harassment.\nDonald Trump supporter Cathy Frasca handwrote a four-page letter with advice for the GOP nominee that said: â€œIt is obvious that you could easily lose this election.â€? (Jenna Johnson/The Washington Post)\nOn Monday morning, Frasca put on a yellow T-shirt featuring a screaming Hillary Clinton, flames and the message, â€œLiar! Liar! Pants suit on fire.â€? She and a few friends from her retirement community in Sewickley traveled a few miles north to a high school gym in this suburb of Pittsburgh for a Trump rally. Frasca brought along a copy of the letter she mailed to Trump Tower, just in case she got to meet the candidate.\n[ The GOP tumbles toward anarchy: â€˜Itâ€™s every person for himself or herself ]\nAt rallies like these, Trump can live in a world where he is still winning. He was introduced as â€œthe next presidentâ€? and greeted by a screaming crowd of 2,500 while, he said, â€œthousands and thousandsâ€? more waited outside. There were no polls showing Clinton with a double-digit lead, no debate moderators grilling him on the Syrian conflict, no party leaders telling him to tone it down. Here, Trump declared himself the winner of the debate, berated the media and attacked Clinton without any interruptions from fact-checkers.\nCrowds like these are Trumpâ€™s case for not dropping out of the race. Crowds like these are his evidence that he can still win. Crowds are his polls.\nBut Trump has already won these people over, and if he wants to win the election, he has to dramatically broaden his following.\nOutside the high school, a few dozen union workers and protesters gathered. One man held a sign that said, â€œTrump is a sexual pervert.â€? Three young women chanted: â€œTrumpâ€™s unfit!â€?\nJamie Young, 49, watched the commotion from a friendâ€™s porch. She voted for Trump in Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Republican primary and went to five of his rallies ? and is now embarrassed that she did.\nSupporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump cheer as he speaks during a campaign rally, Monday, Oct. 10, 2016, in Ambridge, Pa. (Evan Vucci/AP)\nâ€œThe tipping point for me was this last video ? itâ€™s like, enough is enough. Enough is enough. Iâ€™ve had it,â€? said Young, an airport worker who now plans to write in Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee. â€œI believed that he was tough and he had a set ? but his set is a little too big.â€?\nClinton supporter Marlene Monza, 65, brought along a mannequin dressed in a suit and wearing bright lipstick, along with a sign decorated with hearts: â€œThis is the presidential look that has my vote!â€?\nâ€œThis contest is not so much between him and her, itâ€™s gender-based, because if we had a Democrat who was a 90-year-old man in a wheelchair on oxygen he would be 90 points ahead of Donald Trump right now,â€? said Monza, who remembers being asked at her first job interview if she had a boyfriend and, later, not being able to get a credit card in her own name.\n[ As Clinton gains, Trump supporters seem to hate her more than ever ]\nHer friend Joan Verner, 73, almost started crying as she looked at a line of Trump supporters stretching more than a quarter of a mile. Verner brought along two black cats ? Halloween decorations turned into political statements about Trumpâ€™s crude boast on the 2005 videotape about grabbing women â€œby the p---y.â€?\nâ€œI cannot believe all of the derogatory things that he has said about women,â€? said Verner, who has voted for Republicans and Democrats. â€œHe does not have a nice thing to say about women. And they want to line up and vote for him?â€?\nOn the other side of the street, a Trump supporter in line screamed: â€œWhat about Bill Clinton? Clinton is still a rapist!â€? A vendor sold blue yard signs that said: â€œTrump that b---- before itâ€™s too late.â€? Another sold T-shirts showing a cartoon Trump urinating on the word â€œHillary.â€?\nPam Butler, 59, is worried Trump will lose. She blames the Republican establishment.\nButler, who lives in Evans City and works at the post office, was appalled to learn that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) announced Monday he would no longer defend Trump or campaign with him. â€œIâ€™m sickened by it, just sickened,â€? she said. â€œTheyâ€™re going to regret it. . . . Theyâ€™re going to regret it in the end. I hope they do. Their constituents are going to leave them.â€?\nRon Ritz, 69, blames the media for making a big deal out of Trumpâ€™s 2005 comments. Ritz said now that Trump has apologized, everyone needs to move on and focus on issues of greater importance ? such as Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server while secretary of state and her response to the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.\nâ€œWe are guys, and there are locker room statements, okay? There are girls that go to locker rooms and make statements, too,â€? said Ritz, an Air Force veteran who lives in Somerset County.\nHe said he had never expressed anything like what Trump said in the tape but admitted, â€œI have said things to guys that I would not say to a girl.â€?\nRitz said that the polls are not accurate and that he expects Trump to win ? but that the Republican could lose because Democrats will use the names of dead people to pile up fraudulent votes.\nâ€œIf things are done aboveboard and legally, the American people want Donald J. Trump. They do not like Hillary,â€? Ritz said. â€œWhere I have been, I have not seen two Hillary signs ? and hundreds of Trump signs. Thatâ€™s a fact.â€?\nIn the high school gym, it seemed like Trump was polling at 100 percent. The screaming crowd reassured Frasca, the letter-writing grandmother who still hopes Trump will read her letter and adopt her strategy. If he wins, she has promised her neighbors that she will crack open an expensive bottle of Scotch that belonged to her late husband.\nâ€œI pray every night that he will be president,â€? she said. â€œAnd every night I worry that she will be president.â€?\npolitics\nNews and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11.\npost_newsletter353\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

He is accompanied to the set by â€œAccess Hollywoodâ€? host Billy Bush (left). (Obtained by The Washington Post)\nThe â€œTodayâ€? show had no choice on Monday morning ? it had to address the suspension of Billy Bush , the showâ€™s 9 a.m. co-anchor. On Friday, The Washington Post published a 2005?video of?Donald Trump making extremely lewd comments about women, all while on a bus with Bush to film a segment on â€œAccess Hollywood,â€? where Bush was a co-host at the time. Bush, who can be heard laughing and?joking with Trump during the exchange, faced massive criticism from viewers.\n[ NBC has suspended Billy Bush. But will he ever come back? ]\nBush released an apology Friday, saying he was â€œembarrassed and ashamedâ€? and noting that â€œitâ€™s no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago ? I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along.â€? Rumors flew over the weekend about Bushâ€™s â€œTodayâ€? show status; several publications reported that he would appear on air Monday morning and address the incident that occurred on?â€œAccess Hollywood,â€? a syndicated entertainment program owned by NBC Universal. But on Sunday night, NBC News confirmed that Bush was indefinitely suspended from the program.\nDuring the 9 a.m. hour, which?Bush?has co-anchored since August, co-anchors Al Roker and Tamron Hall?addressed the matter pretty quickly.\n[ Billy Bush was already polarizing. His lewd Donald Trump conversation makes things much worse. ]\nâ€œAs you can see, Billy Bush is not joining us today, as youâ€™re probably aware, part of that 2005 â€˜Access Hollywoodâ€™ taping with Donald Trump thatâ€™s been in the news all weekend,â€?

(overseen by the entertainment division, as opposed to NBC News) had discovered the tape last Monday and the network was waiting for lawyers to give the go-ahead.\nEarlier on â€œToday,â€? as the show started at 7 a.m.,?viewers were immediately greeted to a quick scene from the video of Bush and Trump getting off the bus, as co-anchor Savannah Guthrieâ€™s voiceover recapped the events of the weekend. Guthrie and Lester Holt (in for Matt Lauer)?kicked off? with talk of the debate , as NBC reporter Hallie Jackson called it the â€œvulgar audio thatâ€™s thrown [Trumpâ€™s]?campaign into crisis.â€? She then clarified that the audio was â€œpart of a 2005 conversation with Billy Bush?during an â€˜Access Hollywoodâ€™ taping, a program produced by NBC Universal.â€?\nThe show aired brief footage of the bus video, where viewers could?hear Trump talking about how he likes to automatically start kissing beautiful women: â€œWhen youâ€™re a star, they let you do it. You can do everything,â€? while Bush laughs and adds, â€œWhatever you want.â€? â€œGrab them by the p?y,â€? Trump then says.\nGuthrie also noted that Bush was suspended and added the disclaimer that?â€œAccess Hollywoodâ€? is produced by NBC Newsâ€™s parent company.?The video with footage of Trump and Bush came up a few more times during the earlier hours of â€œToday,â€? with reporter Andrea Mitchell saying that Trump was defiant about that?â€œbombshell â€˜Access Hollywoodâ€™ tape bragging about his sexual conquests.â€?\nIn May, NBC announced that Bush would join â€œTodayâ€? as a co-anchor, and in what CNN media reporter Brian Stelter calls â€œa multimillion-dollar bet on Bush,â€? moved him from â€œAccess Hollywoodâ€? in Los Angeles to â€œTodayâ€? in New York.

Now, people in eastern North Carolina are telling us we may have underestimated it.â€?\nBy Sunday, strong winds had toppled trees through much of the central region of the state, knocking out power to about 770,000 homes. In Raleigh, the dam at Lake Benson was breached. Forty-three counties declared local states of emergency, and 4,200 people were in shelters.\nMore than 1,700 people have been rescued in North Carolina. â€œWeâ€™re still rescuing people,â€? said Michael Martin, a battalion chief with the Fayetteville Fire Department, on Sunday. In the early hours of the storm, most of those rescued were motorists, he said, but as floodwaters rose, teams started evacuating people trapped in homes.\nLocal officials expect the wreckage to get worse through the next few days, following the pattern of Hurricane Floyd. A massive wall of water will flow east to the Atlantic, flooding the same towns and submerging the same low-lying communities along the creeks and rivers. It would be the second 500-year flood event in the region in two decades.\nCommunities along the Tar River, where Floydâ€™s floodwaters dealt their most serious blow, are facing the same or worse. The river is due to crest at record levels early this week in Princeton, a small, historic African American community that was almost completely submerged in 1999 and whose rebuilding was an emblem of recovery.\nâ€œThose towns and cities that are in the way of this massive water coming down are in danger as we speak,â€? McCrory said in a briefing Sunday afternoon.\nOn Sunday, the Cape Fear River at Manchester near Fayetteville stood at 31 feet, two feet above its record. By Friday, that water is expected to flood more than 200 structures in the town of Burgaw, about 75 miles downriver. Heavy flooding now in Raleigh is flowing into the Neuse River and is due in Kinston on Friday at a level one foot above the record set in 1999.\nâ€œKinston is preparing for the worst flooding theyâ€™ve ever seen,â€? McCrory said.\nResidents of the southeastern coast of North Carolina emerged shaken after two days of intense wind and rain.\nDave Sinclair, owner of the Ocean Grill and Tiki Bar at Carolina Beach, ventured out with his two children during a lull in the storm to survey the damage. As they watched the waves claw at the coastline, Sinclair said he told his children to respect Hurricane Matthewâ€™s power even in its weakened state. â€œI told them, â€˜Guys, this is barely a 1, keep this in mind,â€™ â€? Sinclair said. â€œThese are intensely powerful storms.â€?\nIn South Carolina, where nearly 650,000 people are without power, state and city officials are urging residents to stay away as authorities assess the damage to bridges and roadways. Communities such as Folly Beach and Sullivanâ€™s Island remained closed to residents who had evacuated from their homes days earlier.\nNearly three feet of water threatened homes in downtown Charleston, and several streets were under about a foot of water as residents came out to start cleaning up. The flooding brought dirt, trash and debris onto the carefully manicured lawns and front porches of homes in the historic city.\nWhile Charleston is beginning to clean up, coastal communities to its south remain under evacuation orders, state officials said.\nResidents in parts of Georgetown and Horry counties have not been allowed to return home.\nSeveral coastal roads were impassable, blocked by fallen trees and debris, local officials said. Meanwhile, sand dunes were washed away on the beach, and roofs were lifted off homes.\nâ€œIt looks like the areas further south were the worst-hit. We arenâ€™t completely sure and assessments are ongoing,â€? said Derrec Becker, a spokesman for the South Carolina Emergency Management Division.\nThe storm hugged the Florida coast, delivering a severe downpour and strong winds that downed trees for hundreds of miles and left 1.1?million people without power, but Matthew didnâ€™t make landfall and cause the level of damage some local officials had feared. â€œWe are blessed that Hurricane Matthew did not make landfall in Florida, but there has been significant damage across our east coast,â€? Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) said in a tweet on Sunday.\nStill, it reduced Floridaâ€™s scenic Atlantic Coast Highway or A1A ? the economic lifeline of the stateâ€™s small beach towns ? to an impassable pile of concrete and asphalt rubble. The National Guard is preventing access to the southernmost tip of Crescent Beach, where the storm chewed up A1A, leaving eight-foot holes in some places.\nAnd in St. Augustine, the oldest city in the country, the wreckage is severe. Flagler College and City Hall, which both date to 1888, are waterlogged. Trees are down and power is out.\nIn the Davis Shores neighborhood of St. Augustine, some residents put the entire contents of their homes on their lawns to be thrown away because of contamination from raw sewage and water, said Mayor Nancy Shaver, who toured the area.\nâ€œBut forget property and businesses,â€? Shaver said. â€œWe came so close to losing many lives.â€?\nIn Georgia, the damage also was not as bad as local officials feared. Thirty counties have been declared federal disaster areas, and residents should continue to stay away from St. Simon Island. â€œIt is considered a public health hazard due to raw sewage on the streets,â€? said Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R).\nDeal,
 who surveyed the area between Savannah and Brunswick by helicopter, said he â€œ was pleasantly surprised on what I saw.â€?\nâ€œWe have been very fortunate. I am grateful,â€? he said.\nRoss reported from Fayetteville, N.C.; HernÃ¡ndez in Charleston, S.C.; Merle in St. Augustine, Fla.

(DVIDS)\nLUMBERTON, N.C. ??Early Tuesday, flash flood warnings remained in effect in Moore County, northwest of here, where evacuations were underway late last night after residents were warned that Woodlake Dam on Lake Surf could fail.\nâ€œMove to higher ground now,â€? said a report issued by the National Weather Service just before?2 a.m.\nA day earlier, rescuers in North Carolina were pulling scores of people from rising waters, plucking them from rooftops with helicopters or corralling them into half-submerged military vehicles in what officials here called an increasingly worrying crisis.\nTowns across the state have been deluged with record flooding after Hurricane Matthew, paralyzing roadways, blackening power grids and leaving some communities stranded, with no easy way to call for help. The full scope of disaster could take days to assess, if not much longer.\nHere in Robeson County, an impoverished inland area, rescue workers were scrambling to reach more than 1,000 people, many of them in a neighborhood of small apartment complexes and public housing.\nBy the afternoon, rescue units had reached many, depositing them at a staging area where they held dripping suitcases, plastic bags of clothing and portable breathing machines.\nâ€œBut this could still get a lot worse,â€? said John Locklear, a local volunteer firefighter who was driving one of the military vehicles. â€œEach house is gonna have to be searched. Just like New Orleans.â€?\nThough the rain had subsided two days earlier, this community ? like other inland areas across the state ? was reckoning the hurricaneâ€™s delayed blow, coming as rainfall rushed into larger bodies of water and overwhelmed levees and drainage systems.\nIn Robeson, the Lumber River was a record 24 feet above its usual level, half-swallowing the southern part of Lumberton, the county seat. In that area, garbage cans and tree branches and charcoal grills floated down the road. Basketball backboards poked from the water ? but their nets were submerged. Hundreds of people had initially evacuated to an elementary school, but then water started rushing in and the evacuations started anew.\nSonar equipment detected several submerged vehicles.\nâ€œIâ€™m scared to give you an estimateâ€? about the death toll, said Erich Hackney, a councilman for the city of Lumberton, â€œand Iâ€™m scared to know what weâ€™ll find.â€?\nThe death toll rose to 11 Monday afternoon when a 75-year-old man was found drowned in his car in Fayetteville after floodwaters began to recede, and officials feared more bodies await them. North Carolinaâ€™s emergency response center said 2,052 rescues had been performed statewide by nightfall Monday.\nThe Lumber River?rose to 24 feet upstream of the city before the river gauge failed on Sunday afternoon. In the city itself, the river appears to have crested at nearly 22 feet and is maintaining that level, about four feet higher?than the previous record.?The Weather Service said on Monday that the levee that protects Lumberton did not fail, rather, the flood water west of Interstate 95 was so high that it was flowing around the levee and into the city through a highway underpass.\nWhile speaking at a?news?conference, Gov. Pat McCrory?said it doesnâ€™t matter whether the levee was breached. â€œThe results are the same,â€? he said. â€œTo the people below the levee it doesnâ€™t make much difference.â€?\nThe height of the Lumber River in the center of Lumberton, N.C. The old record height was 18.3 feet. (National Weather Service)\nThough Hurricane Matthew approached Florida with Category 4 strength, this part of the region was caught off guard. Last Friday, the Weather Service predicted the Lumber River would crest at 19.4 feet, below the record of 20.5. But Matthew ultimately tracked closer to the North Carolina coast than predicted, and Lara Pagano, a Weather Service hydrologist, said the forecast only changed â€œtruly as [the event] was happening.â€?\nâ€œHurricanes will wobble back and forth and that makes all the difference in where we see the heaviest rainfall,â€? she said.\nSpencer Rogers, a coastal construction and erosion specialist with North Carolina State Universityâ€™s Sea Grant program, said the flooding is driven by the dynamics of the stateâ€™s river systems as they run through the coastal plain. â€œThe ocean can receive a lot of water,â€? he said. â€œItâ€™s the river areas where the confined river basin backs up the water and it just canâ€™t flow out fast enough.â€?\nOfficials in North Carolina fear a repeat of Hurricane Floyd, one of the stateâ€™s worst natural disasters. That storm caused 57 deaths ? 35 of them in North Carolina, most of them from inland drowning in the days after rain subsided. Floyd also caused an estimated $6 billion in damages, leaving thousands without homes and keeping communities underwater for days and weeks. President Obama on Monday declared a major disaster in the state, which could help speed up federal aid available to affected residents.\nEven before Matthew, North Carolinaâ€™s soil was already saturated. Then some parts of the state saw more than 17 inches of rain in a day. The subsequent flooding has forced miles-long sections of interstates 95 and 40 to be closed. Schools have canceled classes. Grocery stores are shuttered. Some towns, like Lumberton, have no running water. Statewide, hundreds of thousands of people are without power.\nTowns including Kinston, Goldsboro, Greenville and Rocky Mount are expected to see record flooding, displacing thousands of residents.\nMcCrory said the storm will have long-term consequences for much of the state.\nâ€œItâ€™s going to be a long tough journey,â€? he said, adding that major initial impacts from the storm will continue through next weekend.\nIn the flooded section of Lumberton, rescuers have been working around the clock. Locklear said he went to sleep Monday morning at 1:30 and then was awakened two hours later by his beeper. By the early afternoon, heâ€™d spent a long shift without eating behind the steering wheel of a 2?-ton cargo truck, and his Motorola beeped with distress calls and the back-and-forth of rescuers.\nWeâ€™ve got an elderly person who canâ€™t get out.\nHave you got a rescue crew that can respond to this one? ?\nWe have a family trapped.\nTheyâ€™re on the rooftop?\nLocklear navigated through several feet of water for five minutes and pulled up to W.H. Knuckles Elementary School, where a dozen people were trapped. His crew dropped a ladder into the water and the back of the cargo truck filled with people, who were then ushered to several evacuation shelters because they had nowhere else to go and nowhere else to eat. In Robeson, the poverty rate is 33 percent, more than double the national average, and several who were rescued mentioned with frustration that the flood zone seemed to cut across racial lines; a wealthier, whiter part of Lumberton emerged unscathed, other than some fallen trees.\nReese Thompson, 40, woke up Monday to find his bedroom shoes floating away on one foot of water. He grabbed only his headphones and an Oakland Aâ€™s hat. â€œI said itâ€™s about time to get on up out of this house,â€? he said.\nBarbara Mitchell, 52, had been scheduled for knee surgery this week; sheâ€™d only grabbed enough medication to last through Thursday.\nDoreen Howell, 43, arrived at an evacuation shelter here with only a pocketbook, some medication, a pair of jeans, and a T-shirt saying Love One Another. Her Reeboks were soaked, and she reclined barefoot in a folding chair in a rec center gymnasium. Overnight, 260 had arrived in a space designed for 100. And now children chased one another and dribbled basketballs. Six state championship banners hung from a wall.\nâ€œItâ€™s loud,â€? Howell said. â€œIâ€™m not ready for conditions like this.â€?\nShe sagged her shoulders and talked briefly about the things sheâ€™d lost in the flooding. A television, a computer, her clothing, her family photos. A home, first purchased by her mother, that sheâ€™d lived in since 1989. A 2007 Toyota Camry that she paid off early, using money from her job as a debt collector.\nâ€œThereâ€™s pretty much not going to be anything left,â€? Howell said. â€œIâ€™m starting over from scratch.â€?\nFlooding across eastern North Carolina\nThe Tar River at Rocky Mount crested seven feet above flood stage on Sunday night but is expected to remain in major flood stage until Tuesday evening. Sundayâ€™s crest is the second highest for the city behind Hurricane Floyd.\nThe city warned residents that it was â€œexperiencing elevated flood levels, resulting in road closings, cancellations and rescues.â€? A police official said Monday afternoon he did not know of anyone stranded at that moment ? following 500 rescues since Saturday by the fire department.\nAuthorities pleaded with residents to be careful and to never drive through standing water.\nâ€œWe are still asking all drivers to remain vigilant and not to drive around barricades,â€? Mayor David Combs said
 in a statement. Combs had declared a state of emergency in Rocky Mount on Sunday.\nDownstream from Rocky Mount,?Greenville is likely to be inundated by this flooding later this week. â€œNumerous houses adjacent to the [Tar River] will be flooded in Greenville,â€? said Pagano, who expects the Tar River will crest there sometime Wednesday. â€œAll the roads in and around?Greenville will be flooded and impassable.â€?\nFlood mapping from Greenville, NC shows the airport & even parts of ECU campus will see water. #MatthewNC pic.twitter.com/zCTAg6gbXY\n? Brad Panovich (@wxbrad) October 10, 2016\nGreenville Mayor Allen Thomas issued mandatory evacuation orders for parts of the city as waters continue rising in the Tar River.\nThe evacuation order asked residents who live on both sides of the river to leave home and be prepared to be gone until at least early next week. In addition, Thomas also recommended ? but did not mandate ? evacuations for people who live in other neighborhoods and areas.\nThere were no people believed to be stranded so far in Greenville, a spokeswoman for the cityâ€™s fire department said Monday afternoon. â€œWe are hoping that everybodyâ€™s out,â€? Rebekah Thurston said. â€œThe water is beginning to rise.â€?\nEast Carolina University in Greenville? has canceled class for the remainder of the week.\nSouth of Greenville, the Neuse River runs through the city of Kinston. Forecasters expect it to crest at 26.3 feet, just over one foot shy of the record set during Hurricane Floyd. Even so, Pagano said the flooding in Kinston will be comparable to the 1999 storm.\nThe Black River hit a?record high at Tomahauk on Monday afternoon. Michael Moneypenny, a hydrologist at the Weather Service, said that the river is expected to rise another foot in Sampson County before beginning to recede.\nâ€œItâ€™s really flat there,â€??Moneypenny said. â€œI cannot imagine how many thousands of acres are flooded.â€?\nSusan Holder, a spokesperson for Sampson County, said there is significantly limited access in and out of the county. There is infrastructure damage to major thoroughfares, she said, and the power outages have been extensive. â€œThat leads to isolation as much as the lack of roadways do,â€? Holder added.\nHolder said the state emergency management office was supportive leading up to Hurricane Matthew, but she was still caught off guard by the severity of the situation.\nâ€œWeâ€™ve just simply never seen this much flooding this quickly,â€? Holder said.?â€œWe expected the rain, and we expected the flooding ? just not this fast.â€?\nAll major roads on the south side of Kinston will be flooded, with two feet of water likely on Highway 70. Numerous homes and businesses will be flooded, especially on the south side of the city, according to officials.\nKinston, along with Lenoir County, issued a mandatory evacuation order for residents and businesses along the Neuse River in that county. The evacuation order began at 2 p.m. Monday and residents were told to be prepared â€œto be displaced for several days.â€?\nâ€œWe are asking that residents and business owners comply with requests from first responders and law enforcement to evacuate,â€? Roger Dail, director of Lenoir County Emergency Services, said in a statement. â€œEven if your residence or business does not flood, access may be severely limited or impossible in the next few days.â€?\nBerman and Fritz reported from Washington.

U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor says the high court continues to deeply feel the loss of Justice Antonin Scalia.\nSotomayor said Monday at the University of Minnesota that the Supreme Court was designed to have nine justices to break ties.

(The Washington Post)\nâ€œ Such a nasty woman .â€?\nDonald Trumpâ€™s complaint, grumbled?as Hillary Clinton snuck a dig at his record of taxpaying into a discussion of federal trust funds,?sent a collective shudder through watchers. On social media and post-debate panels, it neared the top of the list of discussable moments, following close behind Trumpâ€™s promise to â€œkeep you in suspenseâ€? about whether heâ€™ll accept the result of the election.\nBut instead of outrage, I felt a short, sharp jolt of joy. If it had been me up on that debate stage, I would have been hard-pressed not to break out a shimmy, which is one on the extraordinarily long list of reasons Clinton has the discipline to be president and I do not. As unpleasant as Trumpâ€™s comment was, and as much as it perfectly embodies the â€œIâ€™m rubber, youâ€™re glueâ€? strategy of his candidacy, the remark provided a perfect illustration of how constrained the limits of acceptable behavior are for women, and how vast and wide open the preserves of allowable conduct are for men, so frontier-like that Trump could wander around them hunting â€œbad hombres.â€?\nAnd in my experience, something electric happens when a woman realizes just how constrained she is, that no matter what she does, some man, somewhere, is going to condemn her as a harpy or a hysteric.\nItâ€™s a distinct revelation from the ones that lead women to reclaim epithets as compliments, to proclaim that â€œb?? get stuff doneâ€? or â€œb?- is the new black.â€?\nThereâ€™s still an element of the nice girl in those formulations, an effort to turn a negative into a positive through displays of hard work and determination. And thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that. Weâ€™ve all got to get up, go to our jobs and keep getting said stuff done, and winning over our detractors is a way to make that routine a little more palatable.\nBut there is a wild energy that comes from knowing that someone, somewhere will always hate you, so you might as well stop trying to win that person over. There is something hugely liberating about having spent years trying, with increasing wobbliness, to avoid stepping outside a circle of propriety thatâ€™s really too small for any person to stand in. And when you contemplate what you could do if you stopped allocating psychic energy to pleasing everyone and the places you might go once you abandon some of the more absurd restrictions youâ€™ve abided by, thatâ€™s where the fun really starts.\nIn these three debates, Clinton hasnâ€™t come remotely close to the level of invective Trump has employed: To do that, sheâ€™d have to suggest that his hair is a crime against fashion sufficient to warrant incarceration, or wander around him during a town-hall-style debate assessing his posterior before announcing her findings on stage in the middle of a rally.\nBut Clinton hasnâ€™t been nice to him, either. She hasnâ€™t been deferential. Sheâ€™s hit him hard, and truthfully, on repeated occasions. She hasnâ€™t shaken his hand. And when asked to name something she liked about him, she chose his children, a compliment thatâ€™s as much if not more to their mothers than?to Trump himself.\nDuring her time as first lady, Clinton often seemed bewildered by how people perceived her, desperate to crack some code that would allow her to be liked. President Obamaâ€™s debate line about how she was â€œlikable enoughâ€? was cutting not just because it delivered a poor verdict on those efforts but also because it mocked her desire to receive that affirmation.\nIf you need a barometer for how much things have changed in those two decades, letâ€™s flash back to a 1995 lunch with what the New York Times then described as â€œa group of women who write about the First Ladyâ€™s social functions, style, gossip and personal advice.â€? Clinton was forced to describe herself as â€œnaive and dumbâ€? about national politics after the failure of her health-care-reform efforts, and to ask for assistance on â€œhow she could better make the public see her in the sympathetic, more complicated way in which she sees herself.â€?\nAfter years of straining for approval, it was a race against Trump, a man whose good opinion isnâ€™t worth earning, that seems to have?cracked that code for Clinton. From where Trump stands, Clinton might be â€œsuch a nasty woman.â€? But from where I sit at home, she also seems freer than ever.\nopinions\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\nI watched the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton . I tweeted, took notes, and picked winners and losers.\nMy choices are below!\n[ Subscribe to Ciquizza, the Fix's news ? and entertainment! -- quiz show podcast ]\nWinners\n* Hillary Clinton: This was the Democratic nominee's best debate performance. She finally figured out the right calibration of ignoring and engaging Trump. Given her considerable edge in the electoral map , Clinton didn't need a moment in this debate, she simply needed to survive. But she had a moment, anyway ? with a stirring answer in response to Trump's comments about women and the allegations against him of groping nine different women. Clinton, borrowing from Michelle Obama's speech on the same subject , was deeply human and relatable in that moment. Throughout the rest of the debate, she did what we know she knows how to do well: She deftly dropped a series of opposition research hits and sprinkled in a series of attempts to goad Trump into mistakes. She came across as calm and composed in the face of his, at times, tough-to-watch interruptions. ("Such a nasty woman,â€? Trump said of Clinton as she was speaking toward the end of the debate.) Her performance wasn't perfect; she struggled to defend the Clinton Foundation, for example, but Trump managed to throw her an opening to talk about his own foundation's issues. All in all, Clinton won ? a clean sweep of the three debates.\n* Chris Wallace: Wallace was the best moderator of the four debates ? three presidential, one vice presidential. Poised and confident, he sought to steer the conversation without dominating it. He allowed the candidates to debate issues back and forth but, when they veered off course and didn't answer his questions, he made sure to let them know about it. And, as was the case in other Fox-sponsored debates in the primary season, Wallace's questions were just top-notch. On immigration, on the women alleging that Trump groped them, on the Clinton Foundation, Wallace asked blunt questions that demanded straight answers.\n* Vladimir Putin: The Russian leader had to be thrilled about the amount of airtime he and his country received in the debate. And Trump, while insisting that he and the Russian president are not, in fact, friends, repeatedly said that he knew for a fact that Putin had no respect for Clinton. Any airtime for Putin in a debate with tens of millions of Americans watching probably make him very, very happy.\nAt the third and final presidential debate, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Russian President Vladimir Putin would "rather have a puppet as president." (The Washington Post)\n* David Fahrenthold: The WaPo reporter who has broken every piece of news about the Trump Foundation didn't get mentioned by name during the debate but he was all over it. Clinton mentioned Fahrenthold's reporting about the six-foot portrait Trump bought of himself ? with charity money. Wallace noted that Trump had used foundation money to pay off fines ? another Fahrenthold scoop . This was the biggest night for Fahrenthold since he won the Ciquizza !!! (Side note: Make sure to read my conversation with Dave about how he happened onto the Trump Foundation story and how he continues to break big news on it.)\n*Puppets: There hasn't been this much conversation about puppets in a presidential debate since, well, ever. Also, making â€œpuppetsâ€? a winner allows me to post this GIF of Gob and Franklin Bluth :\nLosers\n* Donald Trump: Top to bottom, this was Trump's most consistent and best debate. But, it wasn't a good debate for him. Not at all. His signature moment ? and the defining moment of the entire debate ? came when he refused to say he would concede if the election results showed he had lost. Trump's I'll-just-wait-and-see answer was a total disaster and will be the only thing people are talking about coming out of the debate.\nTrump's first 30 minutes were actually quite good. But, as has so often been the case in this campaign, Trump simply couldn't stick to his plan. As the debate wore on, he became more and more short-tempered and curt; it culminated with his sarcastic praise for Clinton regarding ISIS and his â€œsuch a nasty womanâ€? interruption. Trump's task in this debate ? to fundamentally rejigger its course ? was always a bridge too far. But it's hard to see how he even made incremental progress toward that goal on Wednesday night.\n* Down-ballot Republicans: For an hour or so, the likes of Pat Toomey (Pa.), Richard Burr (N.C.) and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) had to be, generally speaking, happy with Trump's performance. But then came the question of whether he would respect the election results if he lost and Trump's total debacle of an answer. It's hard for me to see how Republicans in close down-ballot races can afford to keep sticking by a candidate who has broken with centuries of tradition when it comes to the peaceful handover of power. And you can expect every single Republican ? those in tough races and even those who aren't ? to be asked tomorrow (and the day after that and the day after that) whether they agree with Trump's view on the rigged nature of the election. Not exactly a closing message any of them would choose.\n1 of 20\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

She said he â€œchokedâ€? during his meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto by not pressing his proposal to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and make Mexico pay for it.\nShe later said Vladi?mir Putin preferred a â€œpuppet as president of the United States,â€? referring to Trumpâ€™s repeated praise of the Russian president as a strong leader. â€œYouâ€™re the puppet,â€? he shot back.\nâ€œI never met Putin. This is not my best friend,â€? Trump said a few minutes later, while casting doubt on the finding by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia is behind a series of hacks aimed at disrupting the U.S. elections.\nWhen Trump emphasized his hard-line views on immigration and border security, he opened himself up to Democratic attacks when he remarked, â€œWe have some bad hombres here, and weâ€™re going to get them out.â€?\nâ€œâ€˜Hombresâ€™? The only bad hombre here is @realDonaldTrump and his racist, xenophobic rhetoric,â€? Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democratic nominee for a closely contested U.S. Senate seat in Nevada, wrote on Twitter.\nIn the hours leading up to Wednesdayâ€™s debate, Trumpâ€™s unpredictability flared up. He skipped his morning walk-through, according to a campaign aide. Details surfaced about his motley guest list, which ranged from President Obamaâ€™s estranged half-brother Malik Obama, to Leslie Millwee, who emerged in recent days to accuse former president Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her more than three decades ago.\n[ The presidential debate: Can Donald Trump change his trajectory? ]\nTrumpâ€™s debate problems started at Hofstra University in New York on Sept. 26. For weeks leading up to the eagerly anticipated matchup, polls showed he was chipping away at the lead that Clinton had gained after the Republican and Democratic conventions. But he failed to capi?tal?ize , missing chance after chance to scold Clinton for labeling half of his supporters a â€œbasket of deplorablesâ€? or to raise her use of a private email server as secretary of state.\nHe lingered in talk about the â€œbirtherâ€? controversy that many Republicans wish he would have dropped long ago. Trump reignited feuds with comedian and actress Rosie Oâ€™Donnell and with Alicia Machado, the 1996 Miss Universe winner from Venezuela who has said Trump called her â€œMiss Piggyâ€? and â€œMiss Housekeeping.â€?\nTwo days before the second debate, The Washington Post reported on a 2005 tape on which Trump can be heard bragging about forcing himself physically on women sexually. The comments were a focal point at the debate in St. Louis, where he apologized for the remarks but also dismissed them as â€œlocker room talk.â€?\nWhile Trump won some credit for putting Clinton on defense over her emails and the Clinton Foundation, the second faceoff was still in large part about him and he did little woo skeptical moderate voters.\nIn the week and a half since then, a series of women have come forward accusing Trump of making sexual advances without their consent. He once again denied all the allegations Wednesday night and tried to move past them, declaring that no one has more respect for women than he does.\nBut toward the end of the debate, Trump, who desperately needs to improve his image among female voters, attacked Clinton in a way that could further complicate the task.\nâ€œSuch a nasty woman,â€? he said with disdain in his voice.\npolitics\nNews and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11.\npost_newsletter353\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

When the final presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump started, it seemed as if it might be the best of the three and certainly Trumpâ€™s best. By the end, it was the story of Trump in Campaign 2016 in microcosm, a series of angry exchanges, interruptions, insults that served to undercut the good he might have accomplished earlier.\nIn the opening minutes on Wednesday night, Trump seemed a different candidate from the Trump of the first two debates and the unshackled Trump on the campaign trail. He was more subdued, more focused on policy and substance, effective in making the case for himself and against his opponent. He appeared to have disciplined his worst instincts.\nBut that was only for a time. Then he became the campaign trail Trump, irritable when criticized, unwilling to accept the assessment of the intelligence community about Russian interference in the election, denying the accusations of nine women who said he had groped or kissed them against their will, and repeatedly lashing out at his rival.\nFinally, it was the Trump who in the past few days has railed against a rigged election system. Asked directly by moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News whether, if he lost, he would accept the outcome of the election as legitimate, he hedged. He would decide at the time, he would â€œkeep you in suspense.â€? It was, as Wallace suggested, an unprecedented departure in the history of the country. It was also a major mistake. Yet Trump seemed not to care at all.\nScenes from the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas\nView Photos\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump go head-to-head during the final debate in Las Vegas.\nCaption\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump go head-to-head during the final debate before election.\nOct. 19, 2016??? Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton answer questions during the third and final debate at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. Melina Mara/The Washington Post\nBuy Photo\nWait 1 second to continue.\nIn that sense, this final debate was what everyone expected, a repetition of what has come before. The likelihood is that it will do little to alter the trajectory of the campaign and that leaves Trump in a perilous position.\nClinton came to the last debate leading in the polls and looking to expand the electoral map. Yet the 90-minute forum was no cakewalk for her. She not only took fire from Trump, she took tough questions from Wallace on issues that had been treated lightly in the first two debates.\nIn some ways, when the focus was on the issues, whether abortion or immigration or taxes and spending, the debate might have been judged as the most even of the three. Certainly partisans on each side no doubt saw a decisive performance by their candidate.\nIt was remarkable how the two could carry on serious debate about some issues ? what to do in the Middle East, the state of the Affordable Care Act ? and then be so personal in their attacks almost with the next breath, as when Trump, near the end, uttered â€œsuch a nasty womanâ€? as Clinton was talking about Obamacare.\nClinton could afford to play mostly to her constituency, given the state of the race. Trump needed to do more than make those in his coalition who most dislike Clinton cheer his attacks. But as he has repeatedly in the campaign, Trump managed to undermine his best moments with his worst, likely leaving him short of his goal ? if it was his goal ? to bring new voters to his side.\n[ Clinton, Trump made 24 notable claims at last nightâ€™s debate, and we fact-checked them ]\nThrough the course of the debates, Clinton has expanded her lead over Trump. Her margin in national polls has increased from about three points just before the first debate to an average of about seven points at the time the candidates took the stage Wednesday night on the campus of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. The same has happened to her advantage in the electoral college, to the point that Trump has no easy or obvious path to the 270 votes needed to win the election, short of a dramatic turnaround.\nThe Fixâ€™s Aaron Blake breaks down the key moments of the third presidential debate on Oct. 19 between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\nPolls and projections on the eve of Wednesdayâ€™s debate consistently estimated Clinton with enough states in her column to put her well over 270. Equally concerning for Trump is the fact that the remaining competitive states, in addition to predictable swing states that have consistently been battlegrounds in recent elections, include a handful of traditional Republican strongholds.\nArizona appears the most attractive target for Clinton among those red states. The Clinton campaign will send first lady Michelle Obama to Arizona on Thursday in an effort to take that state away from Trump. Georgia also appears competitive, though perhaps harder than Arizona for the Democrats.\nThen there are Texas and Utah. Texas will be exceedingly difficult for Clinton to win, but three recent polls surprisingly put Trumpâ€™s margin in low single digits there. And then there is Utah, where Trumpâ€™s bombast has turned off voters and independent Evan McMullinâ€™s candidacy scrambles the state of play.\nJim Messina, Obamaâ€™s 2012 campaign manager, made a telling observation during a panel discussion here on Tuesday night, pointing out the degree to which this campaign threatens to shatter the GOPâ€™s southern block of states and create an almost solid blue line up and down the East Coast.\nMessina noted that almost the entire Eastern Seaboard, from Maine to Florida, could end up in her column on Nov. 8, particularly if Clinton were able to widen her current lead. South Carolina is the one exception, still presumably for Trump. Other Southern coastal states ? Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida ? are either in play or already tilting strongly toward the former secretary of state.\nThatâ€™s not to say all this will come to pass, only that at this point that Trump has managed to squander ? through self-inflicted wounds ? whatever assets he seemed to have before his latest descent began. He has run an undisciplined campaign, replete with wild charges, the promotion of conspiracy theories and fights with members of his own party. He did so again Wednesday night.\nHis travel schedule suggests either that there is no electoral map strategy inside his campaign or that Trump has overridden the advice of his advisers. He was in Colorado on Tuesday, rather than Arizona. He was recently in Wisconsin, which looks out of reach at this point. He will be in Ohio and Florida and North Carolina over the next few days, but also plans a stop in Virginia, despite no objective evidence that he has much chance there.\nThe debates have brought to a close an important chapter in the campaign. Trump and Clinton will continue to take aim at one another on the campaign trail, but the window for persuading voters is closing quickly. With voting now underway in a series of states and with more states to begin soon, the focus will increasingly shift to the more granular competition of turning out every vote.\nHere too, Trumpâ€™s campaign is at a huge disadvantage, dependent either on the candidateâ€™s ability to rouse organically a silent army of voters who have stayed on the sidelines in recent elections and will materialize at the polls this year or, more realistically, on relying on efforts by the Republican National Committee to function as his get-out-the-vote operation.\nAll of that may be immaterial to Trump. He will chart whatever course he chooses during the final 19 days, as he has done since he first announced his candidacy, as he did again in the final debate. But this election remains Clintonâ€™s to lose and Trump hasnâ€™t found a way to change that equation.\npolitics\nNews and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11.\npost_newsletter353\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

A defiant Donald Trump used the high-profile setting of the final presidential debate here Wednesday night to amplify one of the most explosive charges of his candidacy: that if he loses the election, he might consider the results illegitimate because the process is rigged.\nQuestioned directly as to whether he would accept the outcome should Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail on Nov.?8, Trump demurred. â€œI will keep you in suspense,â€? the Republican nominee said. Clinton called Trumpâ€™s answer â€œhorrifying,â€? saying he was â€œtalking down our democracy.â€?\nAfter a sober start, the candidates shifted gears into a series of fiery exchanges over their fitness to serve as president and character traits. But over the course of the third and final debate, they delved deeper into their substantive differences than they did in the first two forums and offered a clearer contrast in the directions they would take the country. They drew sharp distinctions on the economy, trade, terrorism, immigration and hot-button social issues including abortion and guns.\n[ Winners and losers from the third presidential debate ]\nRussian President Vladimir Putin loomed as an unseen third presence onstage. Clinton and Trump sparred over which of them would be more effective as commander in chief in dealing with his aggression and Russian cyberattacks. Clinton labeled Trump as Putin's â€œpuppetâ€? ? prompting Trump to snap back, â€œYouâ€™re the puppet!â€? ? while Trump charged that Putin had â€œoutsmarted and outplayedâ€? her when she was secretary of state.\nHere are key moments from the third and final presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, Oct. 19, in Las Vegas. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\nAfter Clinton cited the findings of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russian government had committed espionage ? including by hacking the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta ? to interfere in the U.S. election, Trump said he did not agree with that conclusion.\nâ€œHillary, you have no idea,â€? Trump said. â€œOur country has no idea.â€?\nClinton and Trump clashed intensely about each otherâ€™s character deficiencies in an urgent bid to persuade undecided voters just 20 days before Election Day and as people in many states already have begun casting ballots.\nTrump was trying to present himself in a more presidential light than at the other two debates, but at times he could not contain his impulses to jab and insult.\n[ Where Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton stand on the issues ]\nAs Clinton was needling Trump for not paying taxes, Trump interjected, â€œSuch a nasty woman.â€?\nThe animus between the two had reached such a critical mass that the candidates dispensed with the traditional gesture of shaking hands, before and after the debate.\n1 of 20\nScenes from the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas\nView Photos\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump go head-to-head during the final debate in Las Vegas.\nCaption\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump go head-to-head during the final debate before election.\nOct. 19, 2016???

Melina Mara/The Washington Post\nBuy Photo\nWait 1 second to continue.\nTrump responded angrily to a question about the chorus of women who have stepped forward in recent days to accuse him of unwanted kissing and groping, in some cases recalling episodes dating back decades. â€œI didnâ€™t know any of these women,â€? Trump insisted, dismissing all of their stories as â€œlies.â€?\nClinton sought to claim the moral high ground by recounting Trumpâ€™s recent mockery of the womenâ€™s appearances and physiques on the campaign trail.\nâ€œDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,â€? Clinton said. â€œHe goes after their dignity, their self worth, and I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a woman anywhere who doesnâ€™t know what that feels like. We now know what Donald thinks, what he says and how he acts toward women. Thatâ€™s who Donald is. I think itâ€™s up to all of us to demonstrate who we are.â€?\nTrumpâ€™s retort: â€œNobody has more respect for women than I do.â€?\nIn the debate hall, the audience laughed, prompting moderator Chris Wallace , of Fox News Channel, to admonish them. â€œPlease, everybody,â€? he said.\nThe 90-minute debate, held on the sprawling campus of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, addressed a variety of issues that have received scant attention on the campaign trail, such as the Supreme Court and abortion rights.\nThe debate opened with a discussion of one of the most consequential decisions awaiting the next president: filling at least one vacancy on the Supreme Court. Clinton cast herself as a champion for progressive values, saying she would appoint justices who would defend womenâ€™s rights and gay rights and help to overturn the Citizens United ruling that has opened the floodgates to money in politics.\nâ€œI feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful, corporations and the wealthy,â€? Clinton said.\nTrump said he would appoint conservative justices who would be strict constitutionalists ? â€œso, so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.â€? And he accused Clinton of wanting to appoint justices who would severely restrict gun rights, saying the Second Amendment is â€œunder absolute siege.â€?\nIn her retort, Clinton noted that because she lived in Arkansas for 18 years and represented Upstate New York in the Senate, she has an appreciation for gun traditions. â€œBut I also believe that there can and must be reasonable regulation,â€? Clinton said.\nClintonâ€™s agenda of gun restrictions is especially popular among suburban women, who are among the key swing demographics in this election.\nClinton and Trump sparred intensively over abortion rights, with Trump acknowledging that if he gets two or three appointees to the Supreme Court, the landmark Roe v. Wade decision would be overturned â€œautomatically.â€?\nTrump went on to describe late-term abortion procedures in graphic language, suggesting that many women end their pregnancies in the final one to four days. â€œYou can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb,â€? he said.\nClinton used the moment to make a gender-based argument, telling Trump: â€œYou should meet with some of the women Iâ€™ve met with, women Iâ€™ve known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family could possibly make. . . . The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families.â€?\nOne of the sharpest differences between the candidates was on immigration and border security. Trump tried to put Clinton on the defensive, saying the country would fall apart if the border with Mexico is not strengthened.\nâ€œWe have no country if we have no border,â€? Trump said, vowing to build a wall. â€œHillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders.â€?\nExpounding upon the influx of illegal drugs into the United States, Trump used a Spanish word in declaring, â€œWe have some bad hombres here and weâ€™re going to get them out.â€?\nClinton said she opposes mass deportations, as Trump has proposed, because â€œI donâ€™t want to rip families apart.â€? And she portrayed Trump as a hypocrite because he has used undocumented workers to grow his real estate empire, including to build Trump Tower, his iconic showpiece in New York.\nClinton also accused Trump of getting weak in the knees when he met with Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto in Mexico City this summer because he did not bring up his vow that he would make the Mexican government pay for the border wall.\nâ€œHe choked,â€? Clinton said. â€œAnd then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said, â€˜Iâ€™m not paying for that wall.â€™ â€?\nTrump seemed to argue for a hands-off policy in Syria, effectively conceding that the rebel-held portions of Aleppo ? which are under heavy bombardment from Syrian government forces and their Russian allies ? were already lost. â€œIt has fallen, I mean, from any standpoint. What do you need, a signed document? I mean, from any standpoint,â€? Trump said.\nHe criticized Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad as â€œa bad guy,â€? but praised him for outsmarting President Obama and others who had called for Assad to step down. â€œHeâ€™s just much tougher, and much smarter, than her and Obama,â€? Trump said.\nIn the end, Trumpâ€™s argument for U.S. policy in Syria was to leave Assad alone, or seek to partner with him and the Russians to fight the Islamic State.\nâ€œHeâ€™s a bad guy. But you may very well end up with worse than Assadâ€? if he was ever deposed, Trump said. â€œIf she did nothing, weâ€™d be in much better shape.â€?\nTrump again and again tried to cast Clinton as corrupt, saying the global charitable foundation run by her family is actually â€œa criminal enterpriseâ€? because it has accepted millions of dollars from foreign governments and multinational corporations.\nClinton defended the foundationâ€™s
 work and argued that Trumpâ€™s charitable endeavors often work to his own benefit.\nâ€œIâ€™d be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people to buy a 6-foot portrait of Donald,â€? Clinton said, referencing a report in The Washington Post. â€œI mean, who does that?â€?\nThe dynamic of the presidential race has reversed since the two candidates met on Sept.?26 for their first debate. At that point, Trump was cutting into Clintonâ€™s lead in the polls and surveys indicated that Trumpâ€™s supporters were more enthusiastic than hers.\nThough both campaigns have hit bumps since then, Clinton has moved ahead in the national polls and has a lead in nearly every swing state as well. Trumpâ€™s lead has eroded even in states that previously seemed safe. At least one recent poll has shown Trump behind in three states won by GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012: Georgia, Arizona and Utah.\nThe election has taken a strikingly personal and disturbing turn in recent weeks, as Trump has escalated his attacks on Clinton and her family while responding to scrutiny over his own treatment of women. Trump has assailed former president Bill Clintonâ€™s past marital indiscretions and has accused him of sexually assaulting women.\nIn the hours before the debate, Trump signaled that he would aggressively prosecute long-held grievances against the Clintons in a play to his base. Trump invited several controversial guests to sit in the audience for the debate, including Malik Obama , the presidentâ€™s half brother and an avowed Trump supporter.\nTrump also invited Pat Smith, the mother of an American killed in the 2012 attacks on U.S. diplomatic buildings in Benghazi, Libya ? during Hillary Clintonâ€™s tenure as secretary of state. Smith delivered one of the more emotional speeches at the Republican National Convention this summer, blaming Clinton for the death of her son.\nAnother Trump guest was Leslie Millwee, who recently accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her in 1980. Millwee went public with her allegations earlier Wednesday via Breitbart, the conservative website that was run until recently by Trump campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon. Her accusations were widely circulated within the hard rightâ€™s online community.\nDavid A. Fahrenthold and Jose A.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) changes his grandson's diaper while his daughter says her dad can also clean up "the mess in Washington." (Ron Johnson)\nThe ability to steer clear of?the media has become a necessary skill for a vulnerable Senate Republican looking to survive in the Year of Donald Trump.\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has spent most of this election ducking questions about the GOP nominee, whom he supports. (He didn't even mention Trump's name in a recent debate.)\nBut instead of avoiding attention, this week the vulnerable one-term senator made a strategic decision to draw it?to his campaign. Adding one more indignity to the year's list of tough breaks, Johnson launched an ad in which he gets peed on. (Not a metaphor.)\nIn the end, of course, Johnson prevails in his quest to change his?grandson's diaper. He even slam dunks the diaper in the trash from the opposite end of the kitchen, a satisfied smile on his face. The message is supposed to be: Johnson can clean up a mess, whether it's baby pee or "the mess in Washington."\nBut the message we can't help but take away from this spot?is a slightly different one: Johnson would really like Wisconsin voters to start noticing him. Like, now. Please.\nIt's probably not a coincidence this ad comes after a state poll shows his Democratic challenger, former senator Russ Feingold, up by 12 points. (Other polls have shown the race closer. A RealClearPolitics average of the latest polls has Feingold up by almost five?points.)\nSince the start of this campaign, Wisconsin has been near the top of?our most-likely-to-flip parties list. Johnson's?race is currently at second most likely to flip , behind only Sen. Mark Kirk (R) in Illinois. That's largely because Johnson is running for reelection in a state that has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate every election since 1988.\nWhich means Johnson has to run?a spectacular race to keep his seat. He's currently outperforming Trump by an average of four to five?points, but the way this presidential race is going for Republicans, that may not be enough. Hillary Clinton is up by some seven?points in Wisconsin this year, according to the?trusty RealClearPolitics average ?of recent polls.\nRunning a spectacular race seems to mean different things to Johnson's team on different days. One day, it's successfully ducking the media and questions about his party's nominee. The next, it's getting peed on by a baby. Thanks, 2016.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) talks with moderators before his Oct. 10 debate in Phoenix with Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.), their only scheduled debate before next month's election. (Ross D. Franklin/AP)\nIt was buried halfway through a CNN story , but it went off like a land mine with progressive election watchers. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is heavily favored to win reelection in 22 days, campaigned for Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) with a pledge to oppose any new nominee to the Supreme Court if Donald Trump lost the presidency.\nâ€œI promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up,â€? McCain told Philadelphia radio host Dom Giordano.?â€œI promise you. This is where we need the majority, and Patrick J. Toomey is probably as articulate and effective on the floor of the Senate as anyone I have encountered.â€?\n[ What happens to Merrick Garlandâ€™s nomination in December? ]\nMcCain's comment appeared to contradict what Republicans have said since refusing to hold hearings on President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland ? that there would be a debate on the Supreme Court after the presidential election. While Democratic candidates for Senate have tried to make hay of the Supreme Court stalemate, conservatives have cheered at how little attention the Garland nomination has received.\nIan Millhiser, a legal writer at the Center for American Progress, was the loudest voice condemning what McCain had said.\nâ€œImagine a world where [late Justice Antonin] Scaliaâ€™s seat ? and two others ? remain vacant for five years because a Republican Senate refuses to confirm anyone named by the president,â€? wrote Millhiser. â€œThen imagine that all three of these seats are filled five or nine or thirteen years from today, when Republicans finally manage to gain control of both the White House and the Senate.?What reason would Democratic governors have to obey the decisions of such a court?â€?\nElection law academic Rick Hasen chimed in : â€œThis is why Democrats need to retake the Senate if they hope to get a Supreme Court nominee on the Court. I expect if they have even a one-vote majority they will nuke the filibuster if they need to.â€?\nIn a statement, McCain's office clarified that the senator would â€œthoroughly examine the record of any Supreme Court nominee put before the Senate.â€? But few Republicans have been asked to consider an election outcome that remains quite possible: A Clinton victory with short coattails, leaving Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in charge of the upper house and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) in command of the Judiciary Committee.\nLast week, at a town hall meeting in Davenport, Iowa, Grassley feigned exasperation at a question about Garland. â€œYou had to ask that one, didn't you?â€? he said. But after explaining why it was good to avoid an election-year SCOTUS battle, Grassley suggested that the fight could start in January.\nâ€œWe ought to let the people have a voice, and let the new president make a decision,â€? said Grassley. â€œSo whether Hillary wins, or Trump wins, I think it has to be done on January 20 or after that. And I think our Senate majority leader said the same thing.â€?\nAnd last month, in a short conversation between votes, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) told The Washington Post that there needed to be Supreme Court votes after the election.\nâ€œIt couldn't be long,â€? Flake said. â€œSome people would say, 'Oh, hold out as long as you can.' But politically, you can't hold off that long. And you shouldn't. I think we ought to move on him as soon as we get to the lame duck. Frankly, we'll be lucky if ? assuming Hillary Clinton wins ? she appoints him.â€?\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

The very next day, Trump's Tape ? came out, and the day after that, Ayotte announced that she couldn't vote for Trump anymore.)\nFour other vulnerable Senate Republican candidates have also said they won't vote for Trump ? Sens. Mark Kirk (Ill.), John McCain (Ariz.)?and?Rob Portman (Ohio) and Rep. Joe Heck (Nev.). But tweeting about it and talking about it on the debate stage are two very different things.\nHere's a look at how Trump has tripped up some Senate Republicans in their debates ? and, on the flip side, how some candidates tried to score points talking about Trump.\n1. John McCain: I know you are, but what am I\nIn their Oct. 10 debate, McCain (Ariz.) didn't really have an answer for why, as his opponent, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D) pointed out, he had endorsed Trump more than 60 times ? then pulled the plug this month? after the hot-mic tape was reported.\nMcCain pivoted to his opponent's support for Hillary Clinton instead ? a â€œI-know-you-are-but-what-am-Iâ€? attack that Senate Republicans are increasingly relying on to get through these final few weeks of Trump.\nâ€œI wonder, since I renounced my support, if Congresswoman Kirkpatrick is going to renounce her support for Hillary Clinton,â€? McCain continued. (Kirkpatrick, who is hoping to get a boost from Clinton's investment in the state, said she supports Clinton.)\nSo if McCain isn't going to vote for Trump, whom is he going to vote for, the moderator asked. McCain: â€œI think I might write in Lindsey Graham. He's an old, good friend of mine and a lot of people like him.â€?\nMcCain also struggled to talk about whether he trusts Trump with nuclear weapons when Kirkpatrick directly asked him if he did.\nHis response: â€œIsn't that kind of a nonsense question? I've said I don't support him. I do not see a scenario where the finger would be on the button. Do you?â€? He asked Kirkpatrick if she trusted Clinton with the nuclear codes; she said she did. When?Kirkpatrick prodded him again on it, McCain responded: â€œNo,â€? then pivoted to ? you guessed it ? attacking Clinton.\n2. Sen. Pat Toomey: I haven't decided whom I'll vote for\nIn Monday's Pennsylvania Senate debate, Toomey was asked by the moderator three times to give a â€œyes or noâ€? answer on whether he would support Trump for president.\nThree times, Toomey dodged.\nâ€œI have not reached a point where I can endorse Donald Trump, because I have so many concerns about his candidacy,â€? he finally said , later adding: â€œAt some pointâ€? he â€œprobably willâ€? say for whom he's going to vote, â€œbut there is more ethics we need to talk about.â€?\n3. Sen. Ron Johnson: Trump who?\nSen. Ron Johnson, right, during?a debate with Democratic challenger Russ Feingold. (Sarah Kloepping /The Green Bay Press-Gazette via AP)\nIn his debate Friday, one of?the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents, Ron Johnson (Wis.), wouldn't say Trump's name in his debate with former senator Russ Feingold (D). Seriously. Johnson's response ?to whether he'd continue to support Trump despite the The Tape ? is 72 words long, with?not one mention of the GOP nominee's name:\nâ€œI've supported areas of agreement but I've not been shy about disagreeing with our candidate and I'm not going to defend the indefensible. Which is truthfully is kind of a marked difference between myself and Senator Feingold, who must be about the last American that believes that Hillary Clinton is trustworthy. He has completely supported her even though she has a decade's worth record of corruption, lying boldface to the American public.â€?\n4. Rep. Joe Heck and Sen. Marco Rubio:?Going on the offensive\nNot every candidate was thrown back on his heels when it comes to Trump. In Nevada, a battleground state that Trump is within striking distance of winning, Rep. Joe Heck (R)?has taken heat from?Nevada Republicans?for rescinding his endorsement. He even got booed when he announced it.\nBut Heck?was ready for a comeback in his debate Friday with Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto,?who tried to frame Heck's?breakup with Trump as a desperate political act.\nHeck's response ?immediately took the firepower out of that argument. He said?his decision was?â€œextremely personalâ€? because his wife experienced domestic abuse in a past relationship, and he has personally treated domestic abuse victims.\nâ€œAs an emergency room doctor, I've taken care of far too many women that have been victims of domestic violence or sexual assault, and I have great empathy for anyone who has ever had to experience such a tragedy,â€? he said.\nAnd in Florida on Monday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R) was ready to fight back on Trump, too.\nHe is still supporting Trump, but Rubio occupies a different space?than other Senate Republican candidates because he has also directly opposed Trump. Rubio reminded?debate watchers of?that fact Monday : â€œOn this stage tonight, thereâ€™s only one person thatâ€™s ever run against Donald Trump and tried to defeat him, and that was me. Thereâ€™s only one person on this stage tonight whoâ€™s ever voted against Donald Trump, and that was me.â€?\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) speaks during an African American veterans and business leaders roundtable event in Phoenix on Friday, Aug. 12, 2016. (Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg)\nAn issue that has been mostly absent from this yearâ€™s Senate campaigns ? the fate of the Supreme Court ? suddenly erupted Monday after Sen. John McCain indicated during a talk-radio appearance that Republicans would move to block any high-court nominee made by a President Hillary Clinton should the Democratic nominee win.\nMcCain (R-Ariz.) made his remarks on WPHT-AM radio in Philadelphia, during an interview in support of fellow Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.). â€œI promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up,â€? he said. â€œI promise you. This is where we need the majority, and Pat Toomey is probably as articulate and effective on the floor of the Senate as anyone I have encountered.â€?\nThe remark immediately raised hackles of Democrats who have complained about GOP treatment of President Obamaâ€™s judicial nominees ? most prominently Merrick Garland, whose Supreme Court nomination has sat in limbo for more than six months after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) resolved to save the vacancy for the next president.\nMcCainâ€™s comments raised the prospect that the vacancy could extend much longer than that, particularly if Republicans maintain their control of the Senate. Even if Democrats win the majority, they would still need a handful of GOP votes to confirm any Supreme Court nominee ? current Senate rules require 60 senators to close debate and move to an up-or-down vote.\nIf Republicans were in fact â€œunited against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton â€¦ would put up,â€? that could mean the Supreme Court would remain an eight-member body indefinitely ? and perhaps force a change to Senate rules allowing for simple-majority confirmation of Supreme Court nominees.\nMcCainâ€™s office issued a statement Monday afternoon backing off his pledge of blanket opposition.\nâ€œSenator McCain believes you can only judge people by their record, and Hillary Clinton has a clear record of supporting liberal judicial nominees,â€? spokeswoman Rachel Dean said. â€œThat being said, Senator McCain will, of course, thoroughly examine the record of any Supreme Court nominee put before the Senate and vote for or against that individual based on their qualifications as he has done throughout his career.â€?\nLater in the day, during a campaign stop in Chandler, Ariz., McCain avoided the more strident position when responding to a question from local business officials about the court.\nBut the 30-year incumbent, facing his most difficult election since his first race in 1986, made clear that he hopes the issue of defending the court from a Democratic Senate majority and president is something that should galvanize conservatives.\nâ€œThereâ€™s estimates as many as three vacancies could be coming over the next three years,â€? he said. â€œThat can affect us for decades. So itâ€™s my passionate argument for keeping the United States Senate in Republican hands, as a check and balance to whoever the president of the United States is.â€?\nAfter a second stop Monday, with the leaders of the Arizona Farm Bureau, McCain said in an interview that a Republican Senate would temper the types of justices Clinton could get confirmed as president ? not that it would prevent the confirmation of any Clinton nominee.\nâ€œHillary Clinton has supported all the liberal nominees that have come before the Senate when she was in the Senate,â€? he said.\nDuring Clintonâ€™s eight years as senator, President George W. Bush nominated two Supreme Court justices, John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr., both of whom she opposed. As senator she held sway over which lower-level federal judges from New York were nominated and confirmed.\nMcCainâ€™s Democratic opponent, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, trailing in recent polls, slammed the five-term incumbent for advocating â€œpure, partisan politics at its worstâ€? and â€œpromising broken government if Trump doesnâ€™t win.â€?\nAfter McCain walked his comments back, Kirkpatrick spokesman D.B. Mitchell said the retraction did not ring true: â€œhe said what he meant, and meant what he said.â€?\nAnd the retreat did not stop the Democratic National Committee from emailing a fundraising appeal seizing on his original comments.\nâ€œThe GOP has already caused President Obamaâ€™s nominee to have the longest Supreme Court wait in our nationâ€™s history. If Sen. McCain is to be believed, theyâ€™re willing to keep up their shameful behavior for years,â€? read the email, which asked for a donation of $10 or more.\nKane reported from Chandler, Ariz.\n400+\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Scott Applewhite/AP)\nUpdate: Even though he may be right, McCain really didn't want to talk to a local reporter about this -- or other issues -- this week:\nWatch John McCain literally run away from a reporter after drawing fire for comments on SCOTUS (h/t @PowerPost ) https://t.co/eKslJaX6m4\n? Ben Gittleson (@bgittleson) October 19, 2016\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)? may have backed off ?a bit on?his promise this week to hold up whoever Hillary Clinton would nominate to the Supreme Court if she became president. But there is no legal reason he has to.\nSenate Republicans could conceivably hold up a Supreme Court nominee indefinitely, legal scholars tell me. And it's possible?that if?Clinton wins next month, they would consider doing?just that.\nWe have actually been over this before. The night Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Russell Wheeler with the Brookings Institution pointed out that there is nothing in the Constitution that says the Senate has to?confirm, or even consider, the president's nominee.\n(The Constitution says the Senate "shall advise" the president, which over time we've taken to mean will approve or disapprove of. But despite precedent, Wheeler says there are very few courts that would interpret "shall" as "must.")\nSo while holding up a Supreme Court nomination might be contrary to the way we've done things for decades, there is nothing in our rule book that would stop?Senate Republicans from doing it.?President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland holds the record (by almost 100 days) of the longest wait for his nomination: 216 days and counting. As incensed as Democrats may be about that,?they can't really file a lawsuit or anything to try to get Republicans to consider Garland.\nRepublicans can keep up the blockade?when there is a new president (and likely a new Supreme Court nominee) too, Wheeler says. They could?do it if they held onto the majority, and they could do it if?Democrats take control of the Senate with a thin majority, which would allow?Republicans to blockade the 60 votes it will take to approve a Clinton nominee. Clinton could, in theory, appoint a Supreme Court nominee while the Senate is on a break, but if Senate Republicans were in the majority, they could prevent a break from ever happening.\nAnd don't count on Republicans nominating Garland after the election in a lame-duck session. Even Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) thinks that's unlikely .\nThat's because the same calculations?driving the current impasse would apply in the event of a Clinton win. (The current official GOP rationale ??the need to wait for the election of a new president ? would disappear. The political realities would not: replacing one of the court's most conservative justices in recent history with a moderate or liberal one isn't the sort of Senate accomplishment a Republican incumbent would look forward to explaining to base voters back home.)\nOn the other hand, just as we could envision a world where the Supreme Court goes years with eight?justices, we could envision a world where Republicans get punished at the ballot box for it.\nRight now, the average voter does not seem to care much about the GOP?blockade ? at least, not enough to?boot Republicans out of office for it. So?the?Supreme Court vacancy has pretty much faded from Senate Democrats' campaign strategy.?But that could change if days stretch into years without a ninth Supreme Court justice. (There is a law that says there will be nine justices, but it's been followed loosely . The court has sat with six, seven, even 10 justices at different points in history. )\nAmericans' apathy is in spite of the fact the current court has?already opted not to?take up some pretty big decisions on such issues as President Obama's immigration reform and teachers unions. Some of those non-decisions favored Republicans , others Democrats. But could you imagine another few years of deadlocked or non-decisions? That is objectively unsatisfying -- and it's possible that Americans might start to care about how many justices are on the Supreme Court.\nThen, if?there were other vacancies opening up during President Clinton's presidency ? two justices are 80 or older?right now ? Republicans would have a harder time justifying a?blockade of multiple nominees.\nThere is one surefire way Democrats could short-circuit?a Republican Supreme Court blockade: Go nuclear ? specifically, to change the rules (again) regarding how the Senate approves judicial nominations. In 2013, Senate Democrats changed the filibuster rules so that?just a simple majority is needed to confirm most judicial nominations. But they left Supreme Court justices to the original 60-vote threshold. The outgoing Harry Reid?has floated the possibility of lowering the bar?to confirm Supreme Court justices. But he will have?retired by?January 2017, and his likely replacement, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.),?doesn't seem to want to go that far yet.\n"I hope we won't get to that," Schumer told CNBC's John Harwood . "And I'll leave it at that."\nWhich means that McCain is right: Senate Republicans can block a Supreme Court nominee for as long as they want. The question now becomes whether they are up for it.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

They now examine the background and beliefs of their own appointees in nano-grained detail, because they have learned the hard way that justices can turn into reasonable people once on the Court and free of political obligations to the party.\nNow Republicans research a candidate back through everything he or she has ever written or said, back through their college days, back past grade school crayon drawings, right into the womb and DNA testing for reliable reactionary markers predicting decisions like money IS speech, corporations ARE people, and ?maybe even that Donald Trump IS sane.\nIn any case (so to speak) the GOP has their eye on the ball here, and have their sophist thinking caps on. Because they revere the Constitution so deeply, they rewrote it recently to say that presidents only get to appoint Supreme Court justices in the first three of their four-year terms. They then added another clause that says that voters must have a say in any Supreme Court appointments that happen in this period of time. They then added another clause that says that the voice of the people only counts if they vote Republican.\nJohn McCain made this rather explicit this week when he said â€œI promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up, I promise you.â€?

(John Minchillo/Associated Press)\nThe Halloween party thrown by LeBron James for his Cavaliers teammates and crew was certainly a wildly costumed bash . It also served as the perfect vehicle for taking a few spooky jabs at the rival Warriors.\nOne photo from the party posted online by DJ Steph Floss, who bills himself as â€œthe official DJ of the NBAâ€™s Cleveland Cavaliers,â€? showed a skeleton playing a drum kit with the phrase â€œ3-1 Leadâ€? on the front. That, of course, refers to the advantage Golden State held in the NBA Finals before James and the Cavs staged an unprecedented rally.\nA photo posted by DJ Steph Floss (@djstephfloss) on\nOct 30, 2016 at 8:08pm PDT\nAnother photo taken at the Halloween bash showed that James was not above playfully declaring that a specific pair of Warriors had been rendered dead and buried. That would be Golden Stateâ€™s all-star back-court duo of Steph Curry and Klay Thompson.\nThose little tombstones were part of a dessert spread that James himself showed off on his own Instagram account. (â€œPhenomenal,â€? indeed!)?At this point, we can only wonder if, somewhere else in there, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala were given similar treatment.\nA photo posted by LeBron James (@kingjames) on\nOct 31, 2016 at 11:13am PDT\nWeâ€™ll see if this winds up as bulletin-board material for the Warriors, especially with them and the Cavs heavily favored to meet in the Finals for a third straight year. However, it only seems fair, given a comment Curry made in January, when his squad visited Cleveland for the first time since winning the 2014-15 NBA title on the Quicken Loans Arena floor. Of the visitorsâ€™ locker room there, the Golden State star said,?â€œHopefully, it still smells a little bit like champagne.â€?\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane)\nLeBron James didnâ€™t just throw a Halloween party for his Cavaliers teammates and crew, he used it as an opportunity to take a few lighthearted shots at the rival Warriors. Positioned among some spooky cookies were a pair of miniature tombstones with the names of Steph Curry and Klay Thompson on them, and a skeleton was arranged at a drum kit bearing the phrase, â€œ3-1 Lead.â€?\nA photo posted by DJ Steph Floss (@djstephfloss) on\nOct 30, 2016 at 8:08pm PDT\nThe â€œ3-1â€³ reference refers, of course, to the lead the Warriors blew, in unprecedented fashion, to the Cavs in this yearâ€™s NBA Finals. Naturally, some media members covering?Golden State were interested in hearing what those players thought of it, and letâ€™s just say that Thompson was not amused.\nâ€œMan, I donâ€™t care about that,â€? Thompson said Tuesday to? ESPNâ€™s Chris Haynes , who reported that the all-star guard was â€œvisibly irritated by the subject.â€? Itâ€™s possible that Thompson is still irritated by his performance in Game 7, when he scored 14 points on 6-of-17 shooting, including 2 for 10 on three-pointers, while posting a game-low plus/minus figure of minus-11.\nPer Haynes, Curry seemed to react more in the spirit of things, shaking his head and giggling after saying,?â€œIâ€™m just going to keep it quiet.â€? Draymond Green offered a big smile when asked about the skeletonâ€™s drum kit, and he said,?â€œMore power to them. Iâ€™ve already got enough fuel. I donâ€™t need more. Enjoy.â€?\nGreen would certainly seem to have fuel in abundance, to judge from he comments he made before the season but which were published Monday.?â€œIf Cleveland comes out of the East, I want to destroy Cleveland,â€? the versatile forward told TNTâ€™s David Aldridge . â€œNo ifs, ands and buts about it. But I also know that thereâ€™s steps to get to that point. And if and when we get to that point, I want to annihilate them.â€?\n[ Green wants to â€˜destroyâ€™ and â€˜annihilateâ€™ Cavaliers in Finals rematch ]\nSo each side has provided the other with bulletin-board material. In fact, Warriors guard Shaun Livingston guessed that the Cavsâ€™ Halloween gloating may have stemmed from comments Curry made in January, when his team played in Cleveland for the first time since winning the 2015 NBA title on the Quicken Loans Arena floor. Of the visitorsâ€™ locker room there, the Golden State superstar said, â€œHopefully, it still smells a little bit like champagne.â€?\nâ€œI donâ€™t think they like that Steph said that,â€? Shaun Livingston told ESPN. â€œâ€¦ Guys see it and everybody feels their own way about it, but it just fuels everybody for the next time we play them.â€?\nKevin Durant wasnâ€™t yet with the Warriors when they blew that 3-1 lead, but he knows all too well how it feels to cough up that advantage, having done so with the Thunder this spring when they lost to Golden State in the Western Conference finals.

This doesnâ€™t have as much to do with the Chicago Cubsâ€™ cleanup hitter, who turned the smallest offensive play in baseball into the biggest offensive surge of the season. But itâ€™s worth wondering if the Cubsâ€™ best hitter of 2016 ? indeed, arguably the best hitter in the National League for the entirety of the regular season ? could possibly turn the offensive fortunes with one swing, with nothing less than the World Series on the line.\nFirst, the characters: Ben Zobrist, the Cubsâ€™ versatile 35-year-old veteran who currently plays left field and bats fourth, and Kris Bryant, the Cubsâ€™ supremely talented 23-year-old third baseman, who hits second.\nZobrist has been perhaps the most consistent Chicago hitter for the entirety of this postseason.\nâ€œReally good, veteran at-bats,â€? Cubs General Manager Jed Hoyer said. â€œHe delivers against good pitching. So steady. I love the fact that heâ€™s in the middle of the lineup with the lowest strikeout rate and high on-base. Just the kind of grinding at-bat that we want from a veteran guy with kind of a slow heartbeat.â€?\n[ As World Series shifts to Cleveland, game theory gets a designated change ]\nWhich is how he approached one of the Cubsâ€™ most important plate appearances of the postseason, though it didnâ€™t look like it at the time. In the top of the fourth inning of the fourth game of the National League Championship Series at Dodger Stadium, the Cubs didnâ€™t yet have a hit against Los Angeles rookie Julio Urias. The Cubs trailed in the series 2-1, and they had not scored in 21 innings, including shutout losses in both Games 2 and 3.\nZobrist ? again, hitting cleanup ? changed the series. He dropped down a bunt toward third base, where Justin Turner was playing deep. He easily beat out the throw for a single.\nThe next four Cubs: single, run-scoring single, run-scoring groundout, two-run homer from Addison Russell. Chicago went up 4-0 in the inning and scored 18 runs in Games 4 and 5 before beating the Dodgers in the sixth game back at Wrigley Field.\nâ€œAfter Ben laid down that bunt,â€? said Theo Epstein, the Cubs president of baseball operations, â€œwe just started having better at-bats.â€?\nCould one swing have similarly changed the World Series?\n[ Three keys to a Cubs World Series comeback ]\nOver the first four games of the series, the Cubs had scored just seven runs ? fewer than two per game, including two shutout losses. On Sunday night in Chicago, when Wrigley Field was tense with the possibility of elimination, the Cubs had one harmless single through three innings against Cleveland right-hander Trevor Bauer.\nAnd Bryant came up.\nâ€œI really havenâ€™t been contributing much,â€? he said later.\nTo that point, he was 1 for 15 in the World Series. In the first, he took a called third strike against Bauer.\nThis time, Bauer got him to take one strike. â€œI like the fact that he wasnâ€™t just swinging at anything,â€? Cubs Manager Joe Maddon said. And then, with the count 1-1, Bauer threw Bryant a 92-mph sinker.\nBryant drilled it to left-center, where it cut through a stiff breeze that was blowing in. The home run gave the Cubs something they absolutely need to beat the Indians ? a lead, because a lead limits Cleveland Manager Terry Franconaâ€™s ability to expertly deploy his devastating bullpen, led by lefty Andrew Miller.\n[ The Cubsâ€™ not-too-crazy path to a curse-breaking Wold Series win ]\nâ€œThatâ€™s what we all have to be able to do,â€? Maddon said of laying off the pitcherâ€™s pitch and waiting to get a pitch he could handle. â€œThatâ€™s the kind of thing that could get him rolling, thereâ€™s no question about that.â€?\nIt got the Cubs going. Anthony Rizzo followed with a double, Zobrist singled him to third, and Russell managed something of a fortunate break with a spinner down the third base line that went for an RBI single. David Rossâ€™s sacrifice fly capped a three-run inning, and the Cubs had all the runs they would need in a 3-2 victory.\nWe know now, more than a week later, that Zobristâ€™s bunt altered the NLCS and helped the Cubs win a pennant. What we donâ€™t know is whether Bryantâ€™s home run simply turned around Game 5 ? or the entire World Series.\nsports\nGet the top Olympics news by email\nMajor news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens.\npost_newsletter333\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Winslow Townson/Associated Press)\nBATON ROUGE, La. ? Already it has congealed into a two-part national ritual. First comes the unveiling of the mid-season rankings from the College Football Playoff Selection Committee, from its command-central boardroom at a surreal hotel with a gaudy atrium near the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. Just after that, there comes, each autumn, like pumpkins on the porch, the hasty reminder that these mid-season rankings have no relevance to anything except the glories of idle chatter because only the final rankings really matter.\nBut look here.\nOn Saturday in college football America, it grew clear that in some cases, the beleaguered mid-season rankings do matter. It appears we might be living the rest of the season with an ornery Louisville, resentful because the 12-member committee snubbed it to No. 7 last Tuesday when Louisville saw itself as something loftier than No. 7. What a fine dash of spice to add to the balance of the season, an ornery Louisville with Lamar Jackson, who holds a Katie Ledecky-type lead in the national race for the Heisman Trophy.\n[ QB Will Worth leads Navy to its first win over Notre Dame in five years, 28-27 ]\nThe two of them, Louisville and Jackson, just went to Boston College for a game that figured to be intriguing only to next of kin, and maybe not even next of kin. Louisville had just finished the sin of slogging around with Virginia the previous week, needing late Jackson skyrockets to escape. No one could have known the size of the boost it would receive on Tuesday evening, from the committee at the surreal hotel.\nâ€œI donâ€™t think it made it tougher at all,â€? Louisville Coach Bobby Petrino wound up telling reporters in Chestnut Hill, Mass. â€œI think theyâ€™re all a little bit upset. If anything, it motivated us, and our practices were really good the rest of the week.â€? Of those practices, he said, â€œWe practiced fast. We practiced hard. We had great focus.â€?\nLouisvilleâ€™s 52-7 win at Boston College as some sort of formality, digest this: Boston Collegeâ€™s defense ate breakfast Saturday as the No. 9 such unit in the country. It did so with players left over from its 2015 defense, which ranked No. 1. It had allowed 298.5 yards per game this year. At the 6:17 mark of the second quarter, the frightening force that went through it, Jacksonâ€™s Louisville, had 308.\nâ€œLouisville is one of the top-three talented teams in college football,â€? Boston College Coach Steve Addazio told. â€œThat quarterback is electric.â€?\nThrowing and running, he has accounted for 46 touchdowns.\nGood grief.\nAfterward, Petrino fielded a question about whether the romp constituted as a potential â€œstatementâ€? toward the committee. Normally, a coach would answer this by pooh-poohing the thought, saying something along the lines of, â€œCommittee? Iâ€™m sorry, I didnâ€™t know there was any committee. To which committee do you refer?â€?\nInstead, Petrino went right in: â€œI hope so.â€?\n[ Maryland Coach DJ Durkin learns who is the boss in 59-3 loss to Michigan ]\nAnd now, the Cardinals (8-1) are miffed. The committee placed them behind unbeaten Alabama, unbeaten Clemson, unbeaten Michigan, once-beaten Texas A&M, unbeaten Washington and once-beaten Ohio State. Second-ranked?Clemsonâ€™s Tigers, who narrowly defeated Louisvilleâ€™s visiting Cardinals in a fur-and-feathers-flying affair on Oct. 1, should be No. 1 on strength of schedule, according to Petrino.\nMost loudly, Texas A&M, then 7-1, ranked No. 4, ahead of No. 5 Washington, then 8-0, based on a thornier schedule. Well, as has been known to happen with college football Novembers, things just got thicker. Texas A&M, with its haughty schedule and its lone loss a badge of honor at No. 1 Alabama, went to Mississippi State (3-5) Saturday and relearned some things a lot of us had forgotten. For one thing, it learned you donâ€™t want to go messing around in Starkville without your head on straight.\nWhen that fine bowl of a stadium at Mississippi State gets going, there isnâ€™t any better atmosphere in the land and itâ€™s not just the cowbells; itâ€™s the din and the cowbells. It all got going on Saturday because its team romped up to a 28-7 lead on Texas A&M, with Bulldogs quarterback Nick Fitzgerald making off on an early 74-yard touchdown run and then, when things got closer late, a 4-yard run that cemented a 14-play, 73-yard drive.\nWith former quarterback Dak Prescott off to Dallas Cowboys nascent stardom, Mississippi State still has a terrific coach, Dan Mullen, who said, â€œTheyâ€™re young guys who are starting to get it.â€? They had lost thrice this year on the final play of the game, and Mullen said, â€œYou go, for the third time of the season, into a locker room of kids who tried to give you everything that they have, and have it taken away on the final play of the game, you are almost out of things to say.â€?\nInstead, they changed the national landscape, and they left Texas A&M Coach Kevin Sumlin saying, â€œThey dictated play today,â€? and they left Texas A&M sitting outside the big boardroom probably for good at 7-2. That leaves, for now ? and for-now matters! ? a rambunctious chase toward No. 4.\n[ Virginia Tech overcomes ejection to defeat Duke ]\nThat includes No. 5 Washington (9-0), which went on a tricky trip to California and may have found some committee-snub motivation itself, obliterating the locals in Berkeley, 66-27. It includes No. 6 Ohio State (8-1), which had sputtered of late and seemed to need some sort of reassurance that it remains a Tyrannosaurus Rex, which a 62-3 win over No. 10 Nebraska might have affirmed. That 59-point margin could remind some wackos (hi) of Ohio Stateâ€™s 59-0 win in the 2014 Big Ten Championship Game against Wisconsin, which helped push it from No. 6 to No. 4 in the final committee ranking, into a playoff which it then won unstoppably.\nAnd it includes Louisville, a fascinating bunch which, harmed in perception by narrow evasions of Duke and Virginia, might just post some numbers ACC?Atlantic Division.\nDoes it benefit from posting scores such as 52-7?\nâ€œYou know, I guess we do,â€? Petrino told the reporters. â€œYou know, itâ€™s sad because thereâ€™s something called sportsmanship. Maybe I made a mistake. Maybe looking back at itâ€? ? the shocking 63-20 win over Florida State on Sept. 19 ? â€œwe should have kept all the starters in and scored 80 points and, you know, did that. I donâ€™t understand why itâ€™s like that. I really donâ€™t.â€?\nNext in our national ritual, the committee will reconvene in Dallas-Fort Worth, and it will discuss the matters of the game, and it will issue its second rankings of the season on Tuesday evening. It will give Louisville a fresh ranking, maybe even No. 6, and then Louisville might just go back to practice as if that ranking matters.\nsports\nGet the top Olympics news by email\nMajor news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens.\npost_newsletter333\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Most of the student protests have been centered in areas where Democrat Hillary Clinton won at the polls, including states along each coast, major cities, and on college campuses nationwide.\n[ High school students in Montgomery County protest Trumpâ€™s election ]\nThe D.C. studentsâ€™ protest came a day after hundreds of students at a Maryland high school in Montgomery County walked out of their classes and into the streets to protest Trump. That march originally involved students at Montgomery Blair High School but gained strength as peers from nearby schools joined them throughout the day. George Washington University students also participated in an anti-bigotry rally in front of the White House on Tuesday, demanding that their school issue statements vowing to protect minority students and reproductive health care on campus.\nD.C. officials had been aware of the planned high school protest since this past weekend, with students using social media to spread information about the event. Kimberly Martin, Wilsonâ€™s principal, sent an email to the school community Monday morning emphasizing that the protest was not a sanctioned school event and that students who miss class would receive unexcused absences.\nBut Martin wrote that school administrators and teachers defend studentsâ€™ rights to peaceful protest and self expression.\nâ€œWilson Social Studies teachers, and many other teachers, empower students to be inquisitive, informed, and engaged citizens who use critical thinking, inquiry and literacy to prepare for college, careers, and civic life,â€? Martin wrote in the email. â€œHowever, students will be reminded to follow their regular class schedule, as we cannot ensure the safety of any student that chooses to leave the school before dismissal.â€?\n[ Trump just laid out a pretty radical student debt plan ]\nSome charter schools not only allowed their students to attend, but they also had teachers and administrators accompany them to the protest.\nTim Shaw, an eighth-grade humanities teacher at Capital City Public Charter Middle School, said civic engagement is an important component of the schoolâ€™s curriculum; the school encouraged students to attend the rally, with parental permission.\nâ€œOnce we heard about it, we really wanted to get our students to participate in peaceful public assembly. Itâ€™s a human right,â€? Shaw said. â€œWe are really trying to teach students how to be involved and participate in the democratic process.â€?\nHasinatu Camara, 72, cried as she watched the young students protesting in front of the Trump hotel. The D.C. native said watching the students Tuesday reminded her of when she was young in the 1960s, witnessing the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee compel change through protest during the Civil Rights Movement.\nâ€œBut the color line is not here anymore like it was back then,â€? she said. When I watched SNCC ? they were young and they were fearless. They were led by people like Stokely Carmichael and Marion Barry. These could be Marion Barryâ€™s grandkids.â€?\nT.

Unhappy with the election of Donald Trump, several hundred joined the rally near Yale University. ( Stan Godlewski/For The Washington Post)\nNEW HAVEN, Conn. ? Among Americaâ€™s demoralized Democrats, none were more stunned at Donald Trumpâ€™s electoral victory than those at the nationâ€™s left-leaning college campuses who had expected to rejoice at the rise of the first female president.\nHere at Yale University, a deep-blue bastion in a solid blue state, Hillary Clintonâ€™s defeat led some mournful partisans to gather outdoors on election night for a primal scream. A funereal funk then settled over the Ivy League campus as many students expressed fear at what the coming Trump administration will mean for Muslims, Mexican immigrants and other groups subject to the Republicanâ€™s slashing campaign rhetoric.\nâ€œI donâ€™t think I had really prepared myself for the abject, utter loss,â€? said Theo Torres, 23, a law student from Denton, Tex.\nTimothy Pepler, 29, a divinity student from Windsor Locks, about an hourâ€™s drive north of campus, called it â€œa level of despair I have never felt in my entire life.â€? Torres and Pepler joined several hundred students and others in a march through New Haven on Thursday night to show solidarity with immigrants and others who might feel threatened under Trump policies.\n[ Yale professor: My students arenâ€™t snowflakes, and they donâ€™t melt ]\nTheir gloom was echoed at other colleges across the country where Democrats outnumber Republicans and where even some conservatives have voiced reservations about the president-elect and the direction he is taking the GOP. Spontaneous election-night protests on some campuses morphed into days of rallies and gatherings that included flag-burning, anti-Trump chants and tense confrontations between\nepithet-hurling students on both sides.\n[ Mobs of tearful students protesting Trump victory swarm college campuses ]\nRepublican students here who openly backed Trump were few in number and discreet in their revelry. Emily Reinwald, 21, of Stafford, Va., co-president of Yale College Republicans, said she and another Trump supporter shook a bottle of champagne and popped the cork early Wednesday outside their campus residence. But they were careful not to gloat in front of housemates, most of whom had voted for Clinton. Reinwald acknowledged slightly mixed feelings. Her heart this year was with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a conservative Republican whom Trump defeated in the GOP primaries.\nâ€œI celebrated Hillary Clinton not winning,â€? she said. â€œMaybe more than I celebrated Trump winning.â€?\nEmily Reinwald, 21, of Stafford, Va., is a Yale University student and co-president of Yale College Republicans. (Nick Anderson/The Washington Post)\nThe Yale College Republicans offer a telling view on the tensions Trumpâ€™s candidacy generated among conservatives, especially in the climate of a largely liberal campus that has been through a year of discussion and debate about tolerance and inclusion. Although the group officially endorsed Trump this year ? unlike its counterparts at Harvard ? that decision divided its members. Some opposed to the Republican nominee fled to start what they call the Yale New Republicans.\n[ U-Va.

He is president of the Buckley Program at Yale, an organization named for the late conservative icon William F. Buckley Jr. that promotes intellectual diversity on campus through forums and other events. Altman said he doesnâ€™t know which party speaks for him, but he said he voted for Clinton. â€œIâ€™d much rather be critiquing Hillary Clinton for four years than having to defend Donald Trump,â€? he said.\nIn this file photo from Nov. 9, 2015, Yale University students and supporters participate in a march across campus to demonstrate against what they see as racial insensitivity at the Ivy League school. (Ryan Flynn/AP)\nYale, a 315-year-old school with 12,400 students and a world-class faculty, has deep connections to national politics. Despite its liberal leanings, Yaleâ€™s history also reflects a strong current of conservatism that produced generations of New England Republicans. Presidents William Howard Taft, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush graduated from its college, and President Gerald Ford from its law school.\nDemocratic President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, also are famous Yale law grads.\nThe latest presidential campaign occurred during an exhausting year for Yale. In fall 2015, racial tensions rose on campus after students claimed that a fraternity barred black women from a party and a university instructor issued an email critique of warnings against Halloween costumes deemed culturally insensitive. In February, the university expelled a former captain of the menâ€™s basketball team, Jack Montague, after investigating an allegation against him of sexual misconduct. Montague denied wrongdoing and later sued the university, claiming a breach of contract.\nIn April, Yale President Peter Salovey announced that the university would not change the name of Calhoun College , a residential unit named for a 19th century U.S. vice president, John C. Calhoun, who was a staunch advocate of slavery. That decision provoked another uproar. In August, Salovey formed a committee to examine â€œprinciples on renamingâ€? and indicated that he could be open to reconsidering the Calhoun name decision.\n[ A year after protests at Yale, hereâ€™s what has changed ]\nNow the presidential election outcome has left many students distraught.\nOn election night, some emailed an economics professor, Steven Berry, to ask if he could postpone a midterm exam scheduled the next morning. He agreed to make the exam optional ? with additional stakes put onto the final exam for anyone who wanted to skip the midterm. Most ended up taking the test Wednesday.\nUniversity officials said academic work must go on. They said they would not issue exemptions, known as â€œdeanâ€™s excuses,â€? granting students a temporary reprieve from testing requirements because of postelection trauma.\nâ€œDeanâ€™s excuses are not designed to respond to reactions, howsoever deeply felt or unsettling, to an event such as a national election,â€? the dean of academic affairs, Mark Schenker, told the Yale Daily News. Instead, Schenker said, students who need help could turn to the universityâ€™s mental health and counseling services.\nSome found solace in other ways.\nOn Wednesday, they grabbed colored chalk and scrawled messages on a plaza in front of Sterling Memorial Library. One read: â€œ#stillwithher and her and her and her and all the capable, powerful women OUT HERE.â€? Others papered bulletin boards anew with fliers declaring â€œLove Will Trump Hate,â€? and other slogans, as if in hope that the campaign could resume.\nâ€œA lot of my friends have been crying,â€? said Rita Wang, 19, a sophomore from Edison, N.J.

(Nick Anderson/The Washington Post)\nDonald Trumpâ€™s victory in Tuesdayâ€™s presidential election provoked intense reactions on many college campuses. Students who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton were stunned, while those who backed the Republican were elated. Some media reports suggested that liberal faculty on left-leaning campuses were coddling grief-stricken students who had voted for Clinton, by scrapping exams and other required assignments in the days after the election. Here, a Yale University economics professor rebuts that notion. ? Nick Anderson\n[ At deep-blue Yale University, students shocked to be facing Trump presidency ]\nBy Steven Berry\nCountless media reports claim that university students are so devastated by the election results that they have stopped functioning. Professors are said to have obliged their â€œspecial snowflakesâ€? by canceling class requirements and exams. â€œChaos on Campus,â€? read one headline. Another was illustrated with a photo of a screaming toddler.\nThe stories feed a long-running media narrative that students, particularly at elite universities, are intellectually brittle and unable to cope with opposing points of view. Even President Obama has warned against any move to so-called â€œsafe spacesâ€? that are supposedly free from opposing points of view. That is, surely, not the nature of the universityâ€™s academic enterprise.\nSteven Berry. (Courtesy of Yale)\nLet me tell you about my students. This term, I am teaching Introductory Microeconomics to a large lecture hall of Yale undergraduates. It is a tough course. We teach the freshmen from a textbook pitched to advanced majors and MBAs. All students, including liberals, learn exacting mathematical arguments in favor of markets, demonstrating the social costs of taxation and the inefficiency of bad regulation. All the students, including conservatives (and yes, they are here in good numbers), learn a rigorous treatment of inequality, market failures and optimal regulation. By the time we reach the difficult three-hour comprehensive final exam, all have to confront and be tested on arguments that challenge their worldviews. At the end, we give real grades on a strict curve, making it impossible for â€œeveryone to do well.â€?\nLet me note that my students are not atypical. In fact, a majority of Yale students take the course.\nSo, how do my supposed snowflakes do when confronted with hard work, disappointing grades, and arguments that confront their ideological pieties at every turn? They do the work, they learn the material, and they are unfailingly polite. I have the best job ever.\nIt was a surprising turn, then, when some media outlets decided that my students were, in fact, the very most special snowflakes. Late on election night, a large number of students emailed me. They were unexpectedly riveted and drained by the ongoing national election drama. Our second midterm exam was scheduled for the next day. Neither Clinton nor Trump supporters were likely to find much time for sleep and they had all studied much less than they expected. Could we please postpone the exam? As a teacher of economic policy, I was pleased that my students were properly transfixed by historic events. Perhaps it was, after all, a bad idea to schedule the exam for the day after the election, but the exam could not be postponed.\nA smaller number of student emails were darker, focused on intensely personal consequences. A few students from immigrant families were suddenly terrified (rightly or wrongly) that family members would soon be deported. These students were not afraid of ideas.\nEconomists like clever solutions, and I thought I had one. Every time I teach the class, I offer students in some personal difficulty the following â€œstandard offer.â€? If they are unable to take the second midterm for personal reasons, I will transfer the weight of that exam entirely onto the upcoming final exam, which also covers the material on the midterm. In light of historic events and the poor timing of the exam, I made a quick decision to make a version of my standard offer to everyone, Trumpâ€™s late-night celebrants included. As it turns out, Harvard Professor Greg Mankiw, Republican economist and former adviser to President George W. Bush, made a similar offer to his introductory economics students.\nThe next morning, the sun rose as usual and I sent the students an email, reminding them that the great majority of them would actually be better off taking the exam. That afternoon, I sat in an empty exam room, waiting for the studentsâ€™ arrival. My smartphone buzzed. Apparently, a Yale economics professorâ€™s special snowflakes were so upset by the thought of President Donald Trump that they couldnâ€™t function and so their idiot professor had made an exam â€œoptional.â€?\nLook, itâ€™s fine to make fun of me. But my students arenâ€™t snowflakes, they donâ€™t melt at the mere thought of opposing ideas, do they? I looked out at the near-empty classroom. Shouldnâ€™t the students be arriving by now?\nThe doors burst open and students who had been studying notes in the hallway outside flowed into the room. Almost all the students were there. Their heads bent over the exam, all math and graphs, with little jokes and tricks embedded in the questions. It was hard and most students took the full 75 minutes. No crying, no whining, no excuses. As the students flowed out, a few paused to talk. â€œYour offer meant so much to me,â€? one said.\nWe old folks have plenty to answer for. The next generation is going to have to be tough. Luckily, I was right: my students donâ€™t melt.\nSteven Berry is a Yale University economics professor.\nlocal\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Brent Lewin/Bloomberg)\nThousands of students, professors, alumni and others at elite schools including?Harvard, Yale and Brown have signed petitions asking universities to protect undocumented students after a presidential campaign that made illegal immigration a flash point.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump made enforcement of immigration laws a touchstone, a position that was popular among?many voters but leaves college officials deeply concerned about immigrant students who were admitted because of their academic achievement and potential. Those students now face fears about educational opportunity swept away and possible deportation.\n[ Donald Trump plans to immediately deport 2 million to 3 million illegal immigrants ]\nWhen Enrique Ramirez applied to Harvard, he didnâ€™t write that his family was supposed to return to Mexico after a work visa expired. When he was accepted, he didnâ€™t know if there were any other students in his precarious position. After President Obama issued an executive order offering protection to students from deportation, the possibility of authorization to work and the chance to get driverâ€™s licenses, he wrote about his situation and began to hear from other students at Harvard. And last week about 20 of them were together, in tears, calling their families, as the election results rolled in.\nâ€œIt just seemed like a very bad thing had happened,â€? said Ramirez, who is 22 and hopes to go to law school next year.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has vowed to immediately deport 2 million to 3 million people who are in the country illegally, focusing on those who have been convicted of crimes. The Obama administration similarly focused removal?efforts on criminals, and his administration deported a record number of people from 2009 to 2014 as compared to previous presidents, according to Department of Homeland Security data.\nThereâ€™s a lot of uncertainty and anxiety at this point, said Terry Hartle, of the American Council on Education.\nExactly how many undocumented immigrants are enrolled in U.S. colleges is not known. Some are protected from deportation through Obamaâ€™s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative, known as DACA. Some arenâ€™t.\nDACA created a database ? and the Department of Health and Human Services vigorously encouraged students to enroll ? but the database provided no legal protection for those who signed up, Hartle said.\nâ€œThis means the federal government has a database of people whose legality in the country can be questioned,â€? Hartle said. â€œThat creates anxiety across the board.â€?\nPeople arenâ€™t sure whether Trump will follow through on campaign rhetoric on deportations, Hartle said; in an interview Sunday night, Trump seemed to focus on people with a criminal record separate from their immigration status, which people in the DACA database, by definition, do not have.\nâ€œThe big question is what will the Trump administration do ? if anything ? with the three-quarters-of-a-million names in the DACA database,â€? Hartle said. â€œNobody knows. Stay tuned.â€?\nHe said itâ€™s far too early to know whether any colleges will choose to become â€œsanctuary campusesâ€? ? or even just what that means. Itâ€™s drawing off the idea of sanctuary cities, he said, and with officials refusing to help authorities identify and find students who may not be in the U.S. legally, â€œbut whether a college can say, â€˜Weâ€™re a sanctuary,â€™ and have it make any meaningful difference is unclear.â€?\nOn Monday, a group of students presented a list of demands to Harvard administrators, representing the estimated 40 undocumented students enrolled, and those who support them.?The Harvard Crimson ?on Monday first reported about the petition, which is?now signed by more than 4,400 people. The students hope to meet with university leaders to discuss it later this week.\nThey asked Harvard to do things such as commit to support the students enrolled by hiring a dean of equity, diversity and inclusion, create a fund to help students with legal expenses, hire a counselor to work with students facing immigration-status stress, and proclaim Harvard Memorial Church a refuge for students facing deportation.\nLorgia Garcia-Pe?a, an assistant professor,?said Harvard has been good about supporting undocumented students, but that not all are even aware that help is available.\nâ€œWhat students are asking for specifically is some sort of central office that can serve as a liaison,â€? something more than a single staff member who is pulled in many directions, â€œin a time when weâ€™re anticipating this will be more difficult for undocumented students emotionally, legally and in other ways,â€? Garcia-Pe?a said. â€œWeâ€™re just hopeful that the administration is going to listen to its students, make Harvard a safe space ? and act quickly.?â€¦ Hopefully theyâ€™ll understand the urgency.â€?\nDavid Cameron, a spokesman for the university, said in a statement Monday that Harvard has long worked to ensure the broadest possible reach of education and research, including on immigration issues.\nâ€œHarvardâ€™s policies have supported all our students at both the college and professional schools to make certain they can fully participate in, and access all, that Harvard has to offer,â€? Cameron said. â€œPresident Faust was an early and strong supporter of the Dream Act and the Administrationâ€™s efforts with DACA to provide students with legal status.?We are following developments in Washington closely and will be engaged in these core issues.â€?\nAt Yale, more than 2,000 people asked the university to make the campus in Connecticut a haven for illegal immigrants, the Yale Daily News reported Monday.\nA bulletin board on the Yale University campus days after the Nov. 8 presidential election.

After Trumpâ€™s victory,?â€œtheyâ€™re much more anxious now, about themselves, and about their families, and will they be able to complete their education,â€? Pomona President David Oxtoby said. â€œItâ€™s been challenging.â€?\nPomona College in Southern California (Jeff Hing/Pomona)\nPomona is one of the most prominent schools in the country to publicly advertise itself as welcoming to undocumented students. It offers need-based aid to all students it admits. Oxtoby has been a staunch advocate of education for undocumented immigrants, saying the country has a moral obligation to help excellent students of all backgrounds who graduated from U.S. high schools.\nâ€œThereâ€™s nothing to hide,â€? Oxtoby said in 2014 about the collegeâ€™s stance on undocumented students. â€œItâ€™s not a secret. Weâ€™re proud of this.â€?\nOn the flip side, there is real pressure to enforce immigration laws, and Trump begins his presidency with a promise to voters to do so.\n[ Federal immigration actions pose questions for colleges about undocumented students ]\nBut students at many schools pushed back with protests and rallies.\nThere's an action on Wednesday and it would be great if we could have it spread #SanctuaryCity #SanctuaryCampus #SanctuaryEverywhere pic.twitter.com/NLJsChvA7l\n?

(Scott Soderberg/University of Michigan)\nStudents at colleges across the country are walking out of class, holding rallies and marching on campus to protest the election of Donald Trump as president. But at the University of Michigan, a different kind of protest has taken shape: Hundreds of students and others have signed a petition decrying anti-Trump rhetoric from the schoolâ€™s leadership.\nAfter a wrenching campaign that left the country deeply divided, tensions have been particularly raw at the University of Michigan in the days following the election, with attacks on students that may have been motivated by their religion. Some students saw another kind of animosity on campus, as well.\n[ University of Michigan student wearing a hijab threatened with being lit on fire ]\nAmanda Delekta, a sophomore, started the #notmycampus petition out of frustration last week, after what she described as university leaders offering safe spaces and encouraging students to attend a vigil, rather than encouraging debate about the results. â€œFor the University of Michigan, that prides itself on critical thinking and open dialogue, I was shocked to see that,â€? she said.\nIt spread quickly. Some wrote anonymously, such as a freshman who said she withheld her name because she is scared to even take out her laptop because it has a GOP elephant sticker on it. Another student wrote, â€œI have experienced more verbal attacks and insults in the past week than I have in my entire life.â€?\nMany signed their names, saying they were disgusted by rigid viewpoints, stereotyping and self-righteousness ? especially at a state flagship that is one of the most prestigious public universities in the country.\nA spokesman for the university, Rick Fitzgerald, said there have been no anti-Trump protests on campus. He said the gathering Wednesday was intended to bring students together after the election. And he said an event at the law school, promoted online as â€œpostelection self-care with food and play,â€? was not related to the election but was one of a series of routine events hosted throughout the year by Counseling and Psychological Services.\nIn a message to campus Wednesday, Mark Schlissel, the universityâ€™s president, announced a series of events, including the student vigil, several programs offering support for students, and analytical discussions. He also wrote, â€œOur responsibility is to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty.â€?\nReebehl El-Hage, a senior studying engineering, said by phone Tuesday that he didnâ€™t vote for Trump but objected to what he called Schlisselâ€™s condemnation of people who did. He had expected the president to understand there were two highly emotional sides ? not to choose one of those sides.\nThe University of Michigan seeks diversity, El-Hage said. Just last month, Schlissel announced the school will invest $85 million over the next five years to boost diversity on campus. â€œThey seek diversity in race, ethnicity, religion. But when it comes to diversity in opinion, theyâ€™re clearly biased on one side.â€?\nAs a Lebanese American student, he wrote on the petition, that?he had never felt marginalized because of the color of his skin. As a conservative, however, â€œit is a whole other story.â€?\nAnd he wrote that Trump won not?because of racism and bigotry, but â€œbecause, as a nation, we have continuously ignored the plight of a large portion of the country who, for the past 8, 12, even 16 years, has been clamoring over its struggles to no avail,â€? citing issues such as rising insurance premiums and the loss of factory jobs.\nOne student wrote that the school had become â€œan echo chamber for those with liberal views,â€? which shuns and shames people who disagree:\nContrary to popular belief, there are minorities who supported Trump and the Republican Party. I, myself, am a member of the LGBT community . . . I will not be labeled as a racist, sexist, xenophobic, and laughably homophobic person simply because I voted for a certain candidate. That overgeneralization is exactly what causes violence, division, and unnecessary tension.\nMichigan, like many universities across the country, has witnessed ugly and frightening incidents on campus since the election. The schoolâ€™s symbolic rock was painted with â€œKill them allâ€? over Republican and Democratic symbols, and university police are investigating three other incidents: A student who returned from class to find a swastika on his door; a student pushed down a hill and yelled at for being in America, with a reference to her religion; and a woman who was forced to remove her hijab.\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Andrews November 15 at 3:58 AM Follow @travismandrews\nRembrandt Pealeâ€™s portrait of Thomas Jefferson hangs in the Blue Room of the White House. (AP)\nIn 1819, well after helping to found the United States of America, Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.\nIt was the stateâ€™s first ?true public university.\nKnown as the â€œFather of the University of Virginia,â€? Jefferson was laid to rest at his home in Monticello, less than 10?miles from his school.\nJefferson embodied the contradictions of his time. He was a slave owner, who wrote â€œall men are created equalâ€? in the Declaration of Independence. But Martin Luther King Jr., for example, regularly evoked Jeffersonâ€™s words in his speeches. On Sept. 12, 1962, King?spoke at the New York Civil War Centennial Commissionâ€™s Emancipation Proclamation Observance in New York City. There?he said , â€œJefferson with keen perception saw that the festering sore of slavery debilitated white masters as well as the Negro. He feared for the future of white children who were taught a false supremacy. His concern can be summed up in one quotation, â€˜I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just.â€™â€?\nNow, a group of students and faculty members at the very school Jefferson founded have chastised the university president for quoting him in a statement she made after the election of Donald Trump.\nFollowing Trumpâ€™s victory, University President Teresa Sullivan sent an email urging students to remember their own responsibility in the world, the Cavalier Daily reported .\nSullivan wrote, â€œBy coincidence, on this exact day 191 years ago ? November 9, 1825, in the first year of classes at U.Va. ? Thomas Jefferson wrote to a friend that University of Virginia students â€˜are not of ordinary significance only: they are exactly the persons who are to succeed to the government of our country, and to rule its future enmities, its friendships and fortunes.â€™ I encourage todayâ€™s U.Va. students to embrace that responsibility.â€?\nIt wasnâ€™t the first such email quoting Jefferson that Sullivan had written to the student body. As The Washington Postâ€™s Susan Svrluga reported , a week earlier she sent one out after someone scrawled the word â€œterroristsâ€? on the door of a dorm room where two Muslim students resided.\nIn that letter, Sullivan advocated peace on campus, writing, â€œThomas Jefferson was the first American president to wrest power from an opposing party, yet he also provided a potent precedent for the peaceful transfer of power and the healing of a divided nation.â€?\nWith the second email, a contingent of the campus decided theyâ€™d had enough.\nAssistant Professor of Psychology Noelle Hurd drafted an open letter ?addressed to the schoolâ€™s president â€œto provide [Sullivan] with some constructive and respectful feedback regarding [her] messages.â€? This email?denounced her usage of quotations by Jefferson, the schoolâ€™s founder, due to the fact that he was a slaveholder.\nFour hundred and sixty-nine students and faculty members signed the letter.\nThe letter read, in part:\nWe are incredibly disappointed in the use of Thomas Jefferson as a moral compass. Thomas Jefferson owned hundreds of slaves. Other memorable Jefferson quotes include that Blacks are â€œinferior to the whites in the endowments of body and mind,â€? and â€œas incapable as children of taking care of themselves.â€? Though we realize that some members of our university community may be inspired by quotes from Jefferson, we also realize that many of us are deeply offended by attempts on behalf of our administration to guide our moral behavior through their use.\nIt stated that, â€œalthough some members of this community may have come to this university because of Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s legacy, others of us came here in spite of it.â€?\nFinally it stated, â€œFor many of us, the inclusion of Jefferson quotes undermines the messages of unity, equality, civility, and inclusivity that you are attempting to convey.â€?\nâ€œThe intention of the email was to start a conversation with our administration regarding ways to be more inclusive,â€? Hurd told the Cavalier Daily. â€œIn the current climate, we must seize every opportunity to communicate that this university welcomes individuals from all backgrounds.â€?\n[ A professor offered to send Trump protesters to Canada ? if they â€˜promise never to come backâ€™ ]\nPolitics professor?Lawrie Balfour, who also signed the letter, said that a simple mention of Jefferson is enough to undo progress ? a cycle thatâ€™s oft repeated during her decade and a half with the school.\nâ€œIâ€™ve been here 15 years,â€? Balfour? told the Cavalier Daily. â€œAgain and again, I have found that at moments when the community needs reassurance and Jefferson appears, it undoes I think the really important work that administrators and others are trying to do.â€?\nSullivan quickly responded on Monday with a letter that reaffirmed the universityâ€™s â€œlong-standing tradition of open discourseâ€? in which she wrote, â€œI fully endorse their right to speak out on issues that matter to all of us, including the Universityâ€™s complicated Jeffersonian legacy.â€?\nâ€œIn my message last week, I agreed with Mr. Jeffersonâ€™s words expressing the idea that UVA students would help to lead our Republic. He believed that 200 years ago, and I believe it today,â€? Sullivan wrote, continuing to state this doesnâ€™t indicate that she agrees with all of the manâ€™s actions, thoughts or politics.\nIn her response to a letter asking her not to quote Jefferson, Sullivan continued to, indeed, defiantly quote Jefferson.\nShe wrote:\nUVA is still producing leaders for our Republic, and from backgrounds that Mr. Jefferson could not have anticipated in 1825, when he wrote the words that I quoted. Todayâ€™s leaders are women and men, members of all racial and ethnic groups, members of the LGBTQ community, and adherents of all religious traditions. All of them belong at todayâ€™s UVA, whose founderâ€™s most influential and most quoted words were â€œ . . . all men are created equal.â€? Those words were inherently contradictory in an era of slavery, but because of their power, they became the fundamental expression of a more genuine equality today.\nThe irony of the situation was not lost on many Twitter users. Others appeared to be angry.\nUVA is upset about their pres using a jefferson quote lol man wild times\n? jimmy vesey (@dudelawless) November 15, 2016\nHe. Founded. The.

He wrote on Twitter, â€œWe should rename Washington High School after San Francisco native, poet and author Maya Angelou. Maya Angelou High School. No schools named after slave owners.â€?\nAnd, as The Post reported , â€œIn 1997, [New Orleans], following a policy of not honoring slave owners, swapped George Washingtonâ€™s name on an elementary school for Charles Richard Drew, a black surgeon who lived from 1904 to 1950.â€?\nSullivan argued that, in the case of UVA, using select Jefferson quotes is not the same as honoring his actions.\nâ€œQuoting Jefferson [or any historical figure] does not imply an endorsement of all the social structures and beliefs of his time,â€? Sullivan wrote in her letter.\nRegardless, Hurd said his contradictions, if left unexplored, could create a hostile environment.\nâ€œThe point is not that he is never appropriate,â€? Balfour told the Cavalier Daily. â€œBut the point is that the move that says, he owned slaves, but he was a great man, is deeply problematic, and I think it will continue to prevent us from being the kind of inclusive, respectful community that President Sullivan and the rest of us envision.â€?\nMore from Morning Mix:\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Trump tweeted to condemn "professional protesters, incited by the media." (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\nProtests that erupted over the election of Donald Trump continued Sunday night in cities across the country, pushing the demonstrations into a second week.\nEven as these rallies continued, Trump ? who has?alternately criticized and praised the demonstrators ? addressed the protesters in an interview broadcast Sunday night, one of the?few public statements he has made since his victory speech.\nâ€œI would tell them donâ€™t be afraid, absolutely,â€? Trump said during the?interview on â€œ 60 Minutes .â€? He added: â€œDonâ€™t be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, donâ€™t be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time.â€?\nThousands of people have protested in cities across the country since Election Day, with the demonstrations beginning in Portland before Trump was officially declared the winner. That city?has seen its sprawling?protests devolve into what police called a riot, and during nights of heated, sometimes violent unrest, authorities said they arrested more than 100 people last week.\n[ A complicated past lies behind Portlandâ€™s violent protests ]\nThe Portland police said Monday afternoon that they determined a 14-year-old boy is the suspect they believe shot and injured a protester there early Saturday morning. The teenager was charged with attempted murder and unlawful use of a weapon, police say.\nPolice had said that the 21-year-old protester who was injured was shot in the leg during the march. In addition to the 14-year-old, who was not named, police said that Shamar Xavier Hunter, 18, identified as the driver of the car that pulled up to the injured protester, was charged in connection with that shooting and another one earlier in the month.\nBut on Sunday night, the Portland police?said there were no arrests at the protest as the?gathering there was peaceful. People came together for a vigil, and a number of speakers discussed a host of issues with the crowd there.\nSolid crowd here in Portland.

While hundreds were arrested in different cities last week, things had calmed by the end of the weekend. In New York, where 79 people were arrested during rallies from Wednesday through Saturday last week ? most of them on the first night, with just a handful scattered from Thursday on ? no people were arrested Sunday night, police said.\nThese demonstrations have largely remained peaceful, according to police, though there have been issues reported at gatherings in?Portland, Oakland and Indianapolis , where police said some at the demonstrations threw rocks and bottles and damaged property.\nSome protesters said they have taken to the streets to rally against Trumpâ€™s litany of statements belittling different groups and his pledges involving immigration and other issues, while?others said they wanted to be with like-minded people after the electionâ€™s unexpected outcome.\nProtesters walk through downtown Santa Ana, Calif., on Sunday. (Ana Venegas/Orange County Register via AP)\nOn Sunday,?Kellyanne Conway, who served as Trumpâ€™s?campaign manager, told Fox News that it was up to President Obama and Hillary Clinton to calm the protesters.\nâ€œItâ€™s time really for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to say to these protesters, â€˜This man is our president,â€™â€? she said.\nObama and Clinton both called for unity last week, with the president saying to Trump during the public part of their White House meeting, â€œIf you succeed, then the country succeeds.â€?\n[ â€˜Itâ€™s now or neverâ€™: How anti-Trump protests spread across the U.S. ]\nSen.

By this point, thousands of people had taken to the streets in demonstrations from coast to coast.\n[ â€˜Not my presidentâ€™: Thousands protest Trump in rallies across the U.S. ]\nTrump?also suggested during the â€œ 60 Minutes â€? interview, without offering any evidence, that â€œin some cases, you have professional protesters.â€? This line of thinking was echoed Sunday by Conway as well as?former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani , who has been touted as a possible attorney general in the Trump administration.\nTrump also complained of what he viewed as a double standard in the response to the demonstrations.\nâ€œPeople are protesting,â€? he said. â€œIf Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, â€˜Oh, thatâ€™s a terrible thing.â€™ And it would have been a much different attitude.

(Getty Images)\nAmerican flags flying for a Veterans Day ceremony at Brown University were snapped in half, torn up and thrown away, according to a veteran who watched it happen and another student who videotaped what he saw happening and posted it online.\nThat prompted other students to counterprotest, according to?the campus newspaper, the Brown Daily Herald , with a senior upset by the actions organizing a group to sit on the schoolâ€™s green to protect the remaining flags. And it opened an intense debate about the meaning of patriotism and sacrifice on the Ivy League campus in the days after a divisive election, with some students saying in online debates that itâ€™s hard to love a country that has committed atrocities and oppressed minorities.\n[ Mobs of tearful, angry students protesting Trump victory swarm college campuses ]\nAt American University last week, some students set American flags on fire to protest Donald Trumpâ€™s election as president and â€œwhite America,â€? saying the country was â€œgoing down in flames,â€? and American flags were destroyed at protests elsewhere in the country in recent days.\n[ Student protesters burn American flags at confrontation over Trump victory ]\nNicholas Strada, a neuroscience major whoâ€™s in an eight-year undergraduate and medical school program at Brown, was in a constitutional law class Thursday when he saw people putting up flags for the ceremony, all along the walkways that crisscross the schoolâ€™s main green.\nWhen he left class, the first flag he saw was snapped in half, just dangling, he said. So he went and bought a roll of tape. While he was fixing it, he noticed a pile of flags lying on the ground, and then another. So he started putting those flags back into the ground, he said.\nThen he saw someone grabbing flags out of the ground and throwing them against a tree. He put those back. Then he saw the same person taking a pile of them and walking off with them. â€œThat wasnâ€™t the only person,â€? he said. â€œSomeone was walking down the path and stomping on them one by one. I went over and nicely asked, â€˜Could you not do that? People just put them up.â€™ . . .?I explained they were for Veterans Day. She said, â€˜I donâ€™t care about that right nowâ€™ and walked off.â€?\nâ€œI was out there for a while,â€? he said. â€œA few people stopped to help.â€?\n[ Tensions over Trump literally ignite when firecrackers are tossed into a college protest ]\nTristan Hood, whoâ€™s studying economics at Brown after four years in the U.S. Air Force, including two tours in Iraq, was one of the people helping to set up the flags. When they noticed later that half the flags were missing, he and two other veterans went looking for them. They found some in a trash can. And they saw a handful of students ripping more flags out of the ground, tearing them up and stomping on them.\nHe said the university administration is very supportive of veterans, but that some students are hostile to the military or confused about what it does. The rhetoric got venomous, he said. â€œThey call us babykillers?â€¦ they say all we do is hide behind a veil of integrity and honor and go around the world enslaving people,â€? Hood said. Some students seem to assume all veterans are white men, he said, but â€œwe have everybody. Itâ€™s a melting pot.â€?\nDuring the Iraq War, Hood said, he remembered people who were frustrated with the conflict, which he thought was reasonable. â€œBut people were careful not to attack the actual service members. It seems like the dialogue has changed, with direct comments against the vets,â€? he said.\nTheir service isnâ€™t political, he said, and nor was the ceremony.\nCass Cliatt, a spokesman for the university, responded to questions with an email:\nWe are investigating the accounts of vandalism to American flags set out on Brownâ€™s College Green to celebrate Veterans Day. Every year members of our campus community come together to honor our veterans and their?commitment to serving our country. The flags were planted a day in advance as part of an event held on Veterans Day, where student veterans and ROTC undergraduates joined students, faculty and staff from across campus for a?Veterans Day procession and ceremony. According to some accounts we have received, members of our community diligently worked to restore the removed flags, some of which had been removed and left nearby. Other flags were?removed by the organizers of the event and replaced the morning of the Veterans Day ceremony. We do not condone the activities that led to the flags being removed, and destruction of property is subject to disciplinary review.\nâ€œWith all the divisions going on, I donâ€™t want to bring more divisions and back-and-forth,â€? Strada said. But debate flared on social media over the weekend, including on a site that?is full of anonymous comments for students.\nAnother student wrote, in part: â€œAre you kidding me? If you despise this country so much then leave it if it makes you that sick and almost makes you puke. The United States is amazing. It is filled with opportunity and amazing people. I love this country and Iâ€™m sick of others in the Ivy League not feeling the same way. . . .\nâ€œI do not care how the hyper sensitive community reacts to my pro-American statements. I am sick of the near censorship present on our campus. And I stand by our nation. I stand by our veterans which include my parents and my grandparents and many before them for generations back. I do not care for those with anti-American sentiments who reside among us. I am an American, and God bless our country.â€?\nA student responded: â€œIt is hard to love a country that does not love you back. It is hard to love a country that has destroyed the homes and families of those you love. It is hard to love a country that does not hold itself accountable for the atrocities it has committed. I love this country too, but I am here out of necessity. I am here because my family had no where else to go, due to actions committed by the US and others.â€?\nAnd another wrote, in part: â€œThe idea that â€˜if you despise a country so much just leaveâ€™ is one that is steeped in hubris, classism, and a complete lack of understanding of the state of the world that we live in. For many Black Americans, there is no â€˜homeâ€™ for them to return to, because their countries of origin were not documented. For many immigrants/asylum seekers/refugees, they cannot go back to their home because their countries are literally getting bombed daily due to the actions (or inactions) of powerful Western entities. Many do not have the financial resources to go back to their homes, and even if they did, they would exist under fear of death because of wars, dictatorships, and regimes that the US and other powers have sponsored or produced.â€?\nAnd a veteran responded: â€œAs a student veteran, I just want to say I get it and I support you. It hurts a lot though. My community has seen, done, and endured unimaginable things and sometimes the only time it feels like all those terrible sacrifices arenâ€™t forgotten is when we see a couple $2 flags on the main green once a year. We were taught to see the flag as a representation of the ideas of freedom and unity we fought for, even though it is rarely achieved. You have assigned the flag a different set of values.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)\nBy Elizabeth Dwoskin , Caitlin Dewey and Craig Timberg November 15 at 7:31 PM Follow @lizzadwoskin Follow @caitlindewey Follow @craigtimberg\nFacebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg took to the social networkâ€™s website over the weekend to dispute allegations that â€œfake newsâ€? had tilted the election for Republican Donald Trump. â€œMore than 99% of what people see is authentic,â€? he wrote, adding it was â€œextremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election.â€?\nBut such reassurances have buckled under mounting criticism. On late Monday, Zuckerberg acted, joining Google in taking the most serious steps yet to crack down on purveyors of phony stories by cutting off a critical source of funding ? the ads that online platforms have long funneled to creators of popular content.\n[ No, this video does not show Obama urging undocumented people to vote ]\nThe move has raised new questions about long-standing claims by Facebook, Google and other online platforms that they have little responsibility to exert editorial control over the news they deliver to billions of people, even when it includes outright lies, falsehoods or propaganda that could tilt elections.\nSuch claims became increasingly unsustainable amid reports that News Feed and Trending Topics, two core Facebook products, had promoted a number of false, misleading and fantastical political stories, such as an article saying Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump, which was shared by over 100,000 users. There were â€œvote onlineâ€? memes that assured Democrats in Pennsylvania that they could cast their ballots from home and a widely shared news release claiming Hillary Clintonâ€™s health disqualified her from serving as president.\nOver the weekend, the No.?1 Google hit for the search â€œfinal election countâ€? was an article from a little-known site claiming that Donald Trump had won the popular vote by 700,000 votes. ( Clinton won the popular vote ).\nFacebook, Google and other Web companies have sought to walk a fine line: They donâ€™t want to get into the practice of hiring human editors, which they believe would make them vulnerable to criticisms of partisan bias and stray from their core business of building software. Yet outsiders, as well as some within Silicon Valley, are increasingly clamoring for technology giants to take a more active role in policing the spread of deceptive information.\nâ€œIt is very difficult for Facebook to say they are not a gatekeeper when they drive such an enormous share of the attention of most news consumers across the world,â€? said Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. â€œThey need to figure out some editorial mechanism; with their scale comes responsibility.â€?\n[ Facebook has repeatedly trended fake news since firing its human editors ]\nWhen Facebook detects that more people than usual are clicking on any given story, the companyâ€™s software algorithms instantaneously spread and promote that story to many other users in the network ? enabling articles to â€œgo viralâ€? in a short period of time and making it harder to catch false news before it spreads widely.\nThe moves by Google and Facebook this week take aim at false stories but donâ€™t impact Facebookâ€™s News Feed or Google Search rankings, the places where fake news has actually spread. Instead, the tech giants are seeking to exert financial leverage that could prompt sites to clean up their act. Publishers make money when Google and Facebook help place ads on their websites, and they share that revenue with the technology giants. Companies found to be in violation of the policy risk losing a major source of ad dollars.\nNearly 1.2?billion people log on to Facebook every day; almost half of Americans rely on the social network as a source of news, according to the Pew Research Center. Google accounts for roughly 40 percent of traffic to news sites, according to Parse.ly, a start-up that analyzes Web traffic data for news publishers.\nGoogle spokeswoman Andrea Faville declined to detail how the company would determine the difference between false and accurate information going forward. â€œWe use a combination of automated systems and human review,â€? she said\nFacebook spokesman Tom Channick emailed a statement about the new policy: â€œIn accordance with the Audience Network policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news. While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.â€?\nFacebook, Google and other sites have struggled to find automated solutions to clamp down on fake news, because there is not always a clear line between true and false news online, said a former Facebook employee who worked on the News Feed product and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to burn bridges with company.\nThe most influential sources of political misinformation on Facebook are not Macedonian fake-news sites or satirical pages but the thousands of partisan news outlets, pages and blogs that derive their traffic from News Feed, the employee said. Because those stories arenâ€™t strictly â€œtrueâ€? or â€œfalse,â€? itâ€™s difficult to design a software algorithm that can distinguish among them.\nSome civil-liberties experts said it was dangerous to push Facebook to take on a greater editorial role. â€œIf we wouldnâ€™t trust the government to curate all of what we read, why would we ever think that Facebook or any one company should do it?â€? said Jonathan Zittrain, faculty director at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard.\nOver the past year, Facebook has struggled to strike a balance. In May, the company was accused by former employees of suppressing news stories that had a conservative bent in its trending-news section, which appears on the upper right corner of a userâ€™s Facebook page. In an effort to quell the criticism, Zuckerberg met with conservative leaders and launched an internal investigation into bias at the social network. (The investigation, conducted by Facebook and not by an outside firm, found no evidence of anti-conservative bias.)\nThe company also published a set of editorial guidelines that detail how human editors and algorithms work together to pick what stories should appear in the Trending Topics.\nThe controversy over trending news reflects Facebookâ€™s challenges in curating content on the medium. Facebook had quietly used a handful of journalists, hired as freelance contractors, to help the curate the Trending section. Those contractors were replaced in late August by a team of engineers who defer most editorial decisions to the Trending sectionâ€™s algorithms. The social network still has an editorial team that manages trending news, and it also allows users to flag hoaxes or fake stories in its News Feed product.\nIn recent months, Zuckerberg has repeatedly emphasized that Facebook is a technology company, not a media company. Still, â€œthere is more we can do here,â€? he said in his weekend blog post. He said he was proud of Facebookâ€™s role in the election and hoped to have more to share soon. The challenge, he wrote, is that any major changes run the risk of introducing unintended side effects or biases.\nâ€œThis is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully,â€? he wrote, adding, â€œIdentifying the â€˜truthâ€™ is complicated.â€?\nAbby Ohlheiser contributed to this report.\nbusiness\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(See item No. 1 on their to-do list, below).\nBut Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, would love to get more than just the bare minimum done to set the stage for President Trump in January.\nHere are six things on Congress's (arguably optimistic) to-do list between now and then:\n1) Make sure the government doesn't shut down\nThe U.S. Capitol during the 2013 government shutdown (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\nCongress hasn't approved an actual spending bill in years; every time they get close to a deal, it dissolves, and to avoid a government shutdown, they?end up passing a short-term spending bill that keeps funding levels from years past.\nThat's exactly what we're expecting to go down this month, when a short-term spending bill they passed before the election runs out Dec. 9. All indications are Congress will simply extend that bill?to about March, when it becomes Trump's problem. (Apparently the Trump team requested this set-up.)\nBut for the Trump administration, there are pros and cons to pushing off a budget deal until spring, which we'll quickly run through here.\nPro: It will allow Trump?to weigh in on the first budget of his presidency.\nCon: It's not clear Congress can pass a full budget. Budgets are a tricky thing to get done these days, thanks in part to a hard-line Republican conference that opposes significant?spending and a sizable Democratic minority that opposes significant spending cuts.\nThat means a short-term budget passed in December could set the stage for drama in March, the most extreme outcome being a potential government shutdown. (We'll know more about the likelihood of that?the closer we get to March).\nOne more con: Having a?big budget debate in March will test Congress's ability to multitask. The?Senate could still be debating Trump's Cabinet (and Supreme Court!) nominees in the spring.\n"Weâ€™ve got a lot of appointments to fill. The Senateâ€™s going to be very, very busy," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned recently .\n2) Everything else\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) with Senate Republican leaders. (Susan Walsh/AP)\nHonestly, making sure the government doesn't shut down is the only big must-do on Congress's to-do list.\n"Everything else is just a 'nice-to-have,' " says budget expert Stan Collender.\nBut Republicans, who will control both chambers of Congress?for the next two years, would love to clear the decks so they can start 2017 by working with Trump on their shared priorities (like, say, repealing Obamacare ). Their get-ready-for-Trump-to-do list mostly includes bipartisan-approved bills, since they'll need Democrats to help them pass most of these:\n2a) Approve?money to fight?the?opioid crisis: This week, the House of Representatives is considering a big medical research bill that would also include money to fight the opioid crisis. The stars are aligning to get this passed: The?medical research package is a priority for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). And the bill also includes money to fund President Obama's and Vice President Biden's "moonshot" to try to cure cancer, which means this could be one of the?final bills Obama signs.\n2b) Pass a defense policy bill:?This sounds boring for anyone who's not a defense wonk or an investor in Boeing, but this bill ? which has no money attached to it until Congress figures out how to pass a full budget ? could set wide-ranging policy, like whether women are required to sign up for the draft ( so far, it looks like that's a no ) and whether religious organizations that work with the?military?must have?LGBT ?and gender-orientation protections in place.\n(Obama signed an executive order in 2015 requiring all federal contractors to have LGBT protections; Republicans in Congress want to make an exception for religious organizations.)\nThe House is expected to vote on this bill Friday.\n2c) Approve aid for the Flint water crisis: Congress has yet to agree on how big of a check to write to the city of Flint, Mich. The town's water was poisoned by corrosive lead pipes almost three years ago and its? mayor says the city still needs to replace up to 20,000 pipes before the tap water is fully potable again. Democrats are the ones beating the drum to get this item done.\nIt's been 431 days since Flint's children were found to have elevated levels of lead in their blood. Families still cannot drink the water. https://t.co/kd8toAVs67\n? Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) November 28, 2016\n2d) Aid to fight Zika: Congress?also agrees it needs to?figure out a way to pay for research and prevention of the spread of the Zika virus, which is at risk of spreading in the contiguous?U.S. (As of Nov. 23, there were 182 confirmed cases from local mosquitoes ? all in Florida ? according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. )\nBut despite spending most of the summer bickering over this , Congress has yet?to settle on how?much money to approve. The Obama administration had asked for $2 billion; earlier this year, Congress came to a tentative agreement of $1 billion?before negotiations collapsed.\nA health worker sprays for mosquitoes in Brazil. (Leo Correa/AP)\n2e) Up Iran sanctions: Obama's Iran nuclear deal isn't dead (yet). And it's unclear where tearing it up is on Trump's to-do list. But even if he keeps the Iran deal,?a Republican-controlled Congress and Republican-controlled White House could give Trump?more opportunities to slap sanctions on Iran for violating it. If they have time, Politico reports that the Senate could start that process this month by voting on an Iran sanctions bill.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	U.S.
1149452	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/02/two-thirds-of-trump-voters-viewed-the-election-as-americas-last-chance/	Two-thirds of Trump voters viewed the election as America's last chance	2016-12-02 00:00:00	By Philip Bump December 2 at 8:36 AM Follow @pbump\nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump. (BILL WECHTER/AFP/Getty Images)\nOne of the more common refrains during America's nearly ever-present campaign season is that this election, this year, is the most important of our lives. We documented this in July, noting that it was first used in one form or another back in 1856 , but has been common since at least 1980. Why is each election most important? Well, that's often a bit more nebulous.\nAccording to a new survey from PRRI and The Atlantic , we can describe one way in which voters in 2016 felt this was the most important election in history. Forty-one percent of respondents ? including two-thirds of those who voted for Donald Trump ? felt that the 2016 election was critical because it was our last chance to "stop America's decline."\nThe fraction of Hillary Clinton voters who agreed with that sentiment was much smaller, at only a fifth.\nTrump himself positioned this election as a final opportunity for his party, at one point telling the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody that 2016 was "the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning" -- in part thanks to shifting demographics. The idea of decline clearly also overlaps with the motto embroidered into his hats. America was once great; it no longer is; Trump will reverse that. The decline will stop.\nResponses to the question also correlate to age and economic status. Older Americans were more likely to agree with the sentiment, as were members of the white working class.\nThis is unsurprising in part because those are also voters who broadly supported Trump. Which raises the chicken-and-egg component that always lingers around questions like this. Did those voters feel like this was the last chance to halt the country's decline and therefore voted for Trump? Or did they prefer Trump and therefore embrace his rhetoric?\nPRRI and The Atlantic asked some questions which get a bit deeper into the "why" of the decline. What is it that has changed?\nIn one question, the researchers asked if people thought that things had changed so much they now felt like strangers in their own country. Trump voters were slightly more likely to agree with that point.\nThey also asked if efforts to increase diversity usually comes at the expense of white Americans. The overlap of Trump support and racial tension has been well documented , suggesting that this question might get at the question of decline.\nThe poll found that Trump voters were significantly more likely to say that they agreed than were Clinton voters.\nHalf of Trump voters agreed with each sentiment. But, then, half didn't.\nThe net result of the election is that those voters who were worried about the decline of the United States are now among the most optimistic about the next four years. About 28 percent of Americans think the quality of life in their local communities will improve under Trump ? but more than half of members of the white working class who voted for Trump think that it will. (Overall, most people think things will stay about the same.) In other words, for now at least, Trump's core base of support felt that this was an unusually important election ? and that the results stopped what they perceived as the worst-case scenario.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Donald Trump has not changed.\nAt his first rally since being elected president, Trump only occasionally read from his teleprompters, instead entertaining the audience with whatever was on his mind. He recounted in great detail all the ways that he won, noted that world leaders now call him from â€œtheir magnificent rooms,â€? and gleefully reflected on how it was â€œa lot of funâ€? fighting Democrat Hillary Clinton, to which the crowd chanted: â€œLock her up! Lock her up!â€?\nHe complained about his partyâ€™s top leaders, prompted the crowd to boo their state governor, referred to a third-party candidate as â€œthat guyâ€? and told the crowd to keep going as they booed â€œthe extremely dishonest press.â€? He announced his pick for secretary of defense, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, but told the crowd to keep it a secret until Monday. He mocked a small group of protesters as they were led out: â€œThey donâ€™t know that Hillary lost a couple of weeks ago.â€?\nSomewhere amid the insults, grievances and brags,Trump promised to heal this divided country.\nâ€œIâ€™ve always brought people together. I know you find that hard to believe,â€? Trump said Thursday night as he kicked off the â€œDonald J. Trump USA Thank You Tour 2016â€? of states he won. â€œWe are going to bring our country together, all of our country. Weâ€™re going to find common ground, and we will get the job done properly.â€?\nPresident-elect Donald Trump held a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday, holding what his team called "USA Thank You Tour 2016." (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\nThe election might be long over, but Trump seems intent on continuing to campaign. While many presidents-elect before him have used the weeks between Election Day and Inauguration Day to promote policy ideas and reach out to Americans who voted for someone else, Trump fired up his base.\n[ The trick to persuading Trump? Flattery, proximity and snappy pitches ]\nâ€œWhat presidents-elect often do is they try to create the impression that thereâ€™s a healing period now, that thereâ€™s a coming together,â€? said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian. â€œThe impulse generally has been to create a new sense of shared national unity, rather than to show a divided country. Thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s usually not an impulse to hold these rallies.â€?\nAfter George W. Bush was first elected in 2000, he held a series of roundtable discussions that focused on themes of his campaign, such as tax cuts, education reform and faith-based initiatives. In 2009, President-elect Barack Obama took a whistle-stop tour on his way to the inauguration, following part of the route taken by Abraham Lincoln on his way from Illinois to the 1861 inauguration.\nThe speech rolling on Trumpâ€™s teleprompters focused on policy and promises of unity ? but he couldnâ€™t stay on script. After being cloistered away in his skyscraper and private clubs for more than three weeks, Trump was clearly excited to be back on a rally stage, feeding off the energy of the half-filled US Bank Arena. At one point, his oldest son tweeted: â€œHe is having a good time tonight.â€?\nAlthough Trump was his same self, everything had changed. He is now the president-elect. His words are now even more scrutinized. And security is even tighter ? leading law enforcement to shut down several bridges leading into the city for nearly two hours during rush-hour traffic, angering many Cincinnatians. Trump blamed the gridlock for his smaller-than-expected audience.\nâ€œI didnâ€™t know what came with this position,â€? Trump said upon taking the stage, â€œand I didnâ€™t know that they closed down the roads.â€?\n1 of 15\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

But we're never going to know,â€? unless there is a recount, said University of Michigan professor J. Alex Halderman, speaking as part of Stein's team.\nIn Wisconsin, where Trump defeated Clinton by a percentage point, state officials have said a recount will begin Thursday.\nClinton's campaign has joined Stein's recount effort, though it has said it does not expect the outcome of the election to change.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Pat McCrory (R), with his wife, Ann, by his side, tells supporters on Nov. 9 that the results of his contest against Democratic challenger Roy Cooper will be contested. (Jonathan Drake/Reuters)\nOn Nov. 8, North Carolinians went to the polls and chose a new governor: Democrat Roy Cooper. Cooper defeated incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory by?more than 10,000 votes. Itâ€™s a clean win that should bar a recount.\nDespite this, McCrory and other Republican Party officials are engaging in an effort to subvert the election results by tainting them with unfounded allegations of widespread voter fraud and elections officialsâ€™ misconduct. Doing so is not only dangerous, but it also creates the perception that the election results are unreliable when they are not, and it fuels future legislative efforts to disenfranchise voters. This weekâ€™s vote by the North Carolina State Board of Elections to grant the McCrory campaignâ€™s request for a recount of 90,000 votes in Durham County illustrates how merely claiming that the results â€œlook suspiciousâ€? leads to public distrust and encourages a witch hunt for nonexistent â€œirregularities.â€?\nMcCrory originally announced he was filing protests in 51 counties. But so far, his legal team has only filed challenges in a third of North Carolinaâ€™s 100 counties. He has targeted areas that are predominantly African American. These protests take three basic forms ? that a voter is a felon, that a person who voted early died before Election Day or that a person voted in two states.\n[ I used to love playing violin. But mastering it broke my heart. ]\nFrom attending these hearings, we saw that the individuals who filed the protests did not have any personal knowledge of the voters they were challenging. Itâ€™s not as though?they knew their neighbor died or was convicted of a felony or that they overheard someone at a?cafe bragging about voting in two states. Instead, political operatives are using publicly available databases to cross-reference names of voters and people with felony convictions, people who have died, and people who voted in other states. The felony protests in particular tend to challenge the votes of minorities disproportionately and are often submitted without any sort of verification that the person being challenged is the same person found in the amateur database searches. The databases often have wrong information about the nature of a conviction. Having a felony charge does not disenfranchise someone if they end up pleading guilty to a misdemeanor. Using unreliable data results in large numbers of false positives.? Nevertheless, local officials are then enlisted to challenge individual voters based on this unreliable information.\nThe effort is highly organized. Challengers are using a template to file complaints. Descriptions and reasons are the same, word for word. And in most cases, local election officials have dismissed the protests as meritless. Every accusation of a â€œdead voterâ€? has proved to be a vote cast by a living person who voted ? either during early voting or by an absentee ballot ? and then died. Unfortunate but not fraudulent.? Those handful of votes were removed from the final count.\nWhen examined, most claims regarding felons voting were incorrect. Some instances were cases of mistaken identity. In other cases, people had felony convictions but had completed their sentences and had their rights restored. Many of the allegations are easily disputed with a few minutes of Internet research by verifying someoneâ€™s date of birth to show the voter is a different person from the person with a felony conviction, or by finding out whether they have served their full sentence and determining their date of registration. In North Carolina, once people?with a felony conviction serve their?sentence, they are legally entitled to re-register and vote.\n[ No one can stop President Trump from using nuclear weapons. Thatâ€™s by design. ]\nEven obviously legal votes are being challenged. Wake County voter Francis De Luca, who also heads the Civitas Institute, filed a lawsuit last week aimed at throwing out the votes of people who registered and voted during early voting in North Carolina. Same-day registration was reinstated when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit struck down the stateâ€™s?voter suppression law this past summer. The court found that the law eliminating same-day registration targeted African Americans with â€œalmost surgical precision.â€?\nBut even though the complaints are dismissed, the damage is done. Not only are legitimate voters tarnished with having committed voter fraud in public documents available to all, but doubt has been cast over an election for no reason.\nWhy does all of this matter?\nFirst, if North Carolinaâ€™s gubernatorial election results are considered â€œcontested,â€? thereâ€™s a mechanism for the candidates to ask the state legislature to choose the victor by a majority vote. The statute giving the legislature that power also provides that no court can review their decision.? Although there is no evidence of any problems with the statewide election returns, stoking doubt is an obvious effort to create the appearance that the election results are fairly contested. They are not.\nSecond, claiming voter fraud without any supporting evidence is dangerous. Free speech is protected, but one cannot yell â€œfire!â€? in a crowded theater. Itâ€™s dangerous. So, too, is making an allegation of election fraud with no solid evidence. It causes irreparable damage to the publicâ€™s faith in the democratic process.\nThird, we have already seen a willingness for state legislators to run roughshod over minority voters. And despite a federal court rejecting North Carolinaâ€™s previous voter suppression efforts, we expect to see more attempts to deprive people of their right to vote in the next legislative session. Undoubtedly, fears stoked in this election will be used to push those regressive changes through the legislative process.\nWhat we are seeing right now in North Carolina is not new. Improper purges of legal voters using database matches of voter rolls with lists of people with felony convictions and people who have died was the subject of extensive litigation in Florida after the 2000 presidential election. This time as well, it is a systemic effort to undermine a specific election with the added benefit of disenfranchising African American voters disproportionately. Itâ€™s also a test. It will determine who will prevail in the battle over whether people of color and other underrepresented voters such as youths, people with disabilities, the homeless and students will be able to cast a ballot and have that vote counted. All of this appears to be part of a national effort to test the limits of legally permissible disenfranchisement, and North Carolina is ground zero.\nItâ€™s time to move past the dangerous rhetoric being used by McCrory and his allies to disparage the election results. Only then can we focus on the real threat to democracy in North Carolina ? the continual effort to keep people of color and others from fairly and equally participating in civic life.\n0\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Christopher Dolan/The Citizensâ€™ Voice via AP, File)\nBy Marc Levy | AP December 4 at 12:32 AM\nHARRISBURG, Pa. ? A Green Party-backed campaign changed its strategy to force a statewide recount of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Nov. 8 presidential election, won by Republican Donald Trump, and said late Saturday night that it will seek help in the federal courts, rather than the state courts.\nThe announcement that it would seek an emergency federal court order on Monday for a recount came hours after it dropped a case in the state courts.\nâ€œMake no mistake ? the Stein campaign will continue to fight for a statewide recount in Pennsylvania,â€? recount campaign lawyer Jonathan Abady said in a statement issued around 11:30 p.m. â€œWe are committed to this fight to protect the civil and voting rights of all Americans.â€?\nIn the statement, Abady said barriers to a recount in Pennsylvania are pervasive and the state court system is ill-equipped to address the problem.\nGreen Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has framed the campaign as an effort to explore whether voting machines and systems had been hacked and the election result manipulated. Steinâ€™s lawyers, however, had offered no evidence of hacking in Pennsylvaniaâ€™s election, and the state Republican Party and Trump had asked the court to dismiss the state court case.\nThe decision came two days before a state court hearing was scheduled in the case. Saturdayâ€™s court filing to withdraw the case said the Green Party-backed voters who filed it â€œare regular citizens of ordinary meansâ€? and cannot afford the $1 million bond ordered by the court by 5 p.m. Monday. Green Party-backed efforts to force recounts and analyze election software in scattered precincts were continuing.\nThe case in Pennsylvania court has been part of an effort spearheaded by Stein to force recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, three states with a history of backing Democrats for president that were narrowly and unexpectedly won by Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nA recount began Thursday in Wisconsin, while a recount could begin next week in Michigan. Trumpâ€™s victory in Pennsylvania was particularly stunning: the stateâ€™s fifth-most electoral votes are a key stepping stone to the White House, and no Republican presidential candidate had captured the state since 1988.\nStein had said the purpose of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s recount was to ensure â€œour votes are safe and secure,â€? considering hackersâ€™ probing of election targets in other states and hackersâ€™ accessing of the emails of the Democratic National Committee and several Clinton staffers. U.S. security officials have said they believe Russian hackers orchestrated the email hacks, something Russia has denied.\nThey have sought unsuccessfully in recent days to get various counties to allow a forensic examination of their election system software.\nLawyers for Trump and the state Republican Party argued there was no evidence, or even an allegation, that tampering with Pennsylvaniaâ€™s voting systems had occurred. Further, Pennsylvania law does not allow a court-ordered recount, they argued, and a lawyer for the Green Party had acknowledged that the effort was without precedent in Pennsylvania.\nThe case also had threatened Pennsylvaniaâ€™s ability to certify its presidential electors by the Dec. 13 federal deadline, Republican lawyers argued.\nOn Saturday, a GOP lawyer, Lawrence Tabas, said the case had been meant â€œsolely for purposes to delay the Electoral College vote in Pennsylvania for President-Elect Trump.â€?\nThe stateâ€™s top elections official, Secretary of State Pedro Cortes, a Democrat, has said there was no evidence of any sort of cyberattacks or irregularities in the election. Any recount would change few votes, Cortes predicted.\nAs of Friday, Trumpâ€™s margin of victory in Pennsylvania was 49,000, or less than 1 percent, out of 6 million votes cast, according to state election officials. Final counts were outstanding in some counties, including heavily populated Allegheny County, but state and county officials did not expect any outstanding uncounted votes to change the outcome of the presidential election in Pennsylvania.\nPennsylvaniaâ€™s automatic statewide recount trigger is 0.5 percent. Stein drew less than 1 percent of the votes cast.\n___\nFollow Marc Levy on Twitter at www.twitter.com/timelywriter.

The Latest on recounts in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania (all times local):\n5 p.m.\nThe Michigan elections board has ordered an immediate halt to the presidential recount if a federal judge lifts his previous order that the recount occur.\nThe Board of State Canvassers issued the instruction Wednesday in a 3-1 vote. The move is intended as a way to quickly stop the recount if the judge rules before the board meets again Thursday morning.\nRepublican Colleen Pero says the recount is underway more than 20 counties and is set to start in 13 more counties Thursday.\nThe board acted a day after the Michigan Court of Appeals ordered it to dismiss Green Party candidate Jill Steinâ€™s recount petition.\nU.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith, who heard arguments Wednesday, plans to issue a written decision, but he didnâ€™t say when.\n___\n3:20 p.m.\nWisconsinâ€™s presidential recount is more than 70 percent complete, and Democrat Hillary Clinton has gained just 82 votes on President-elect Donald Trump.\nTrump won Wisconsin by more than 22,000 votes.\nThe latest results were reported Wednesday by the Wisconsin Elections Commission.

Lawyers for the state Republican Party and Attorney General Bill Schuette told Goldsmith that his earlier ruling is moot after the Michigan appeals court said the Green Party candidate didnâ€™t qualify for a recount.\nThe appeals court said Jill Stein won just 1 percent of the vote and isnâ€™t an â€œaggrievedâ€? candidate under state law. More than 20 counties so far have been recounting ballots since Monday.\nThe appeals court told the Michigan elections board to reconsider Steinâ€™s petition and reject it. The board plans to meet after Goldsmith makes a decision. Goldsmithâ€™s order started the recount this week. The issue for him was timing ? not whether a recount was appropriate.\n___\n10:45 a.m.\nThe Michigan elections board will wait to decide whether to end the stateâ€™s presidential recount until it sees what a federal judge does.\nThe Board of State Canvassers met Wednesday, a day after the Michigan Court of Appeals ordered it to dismiss Green Party candidate Jill Steinâ€™s petition.

He says stopping the recount would increase voter suspicion about election integrity.\nStein is appealing to the Michigan Supreme Court.\nTrump attorney Eric Doster says itâ€™s â€œpretty clearâ€? the board must end the recount because fourth-place finisher Stein isnâ€™t an â€œaggrievedâ€? candidate.\n___\n1:30 a.m.\nA federal judge could decide whether to end Michiganâ€™s presidential recount after the stateâ€™s second-highest court said the Green Party nominee was ineligible to seek a second look at millions of ballots.\nThe federal judge who on Monday ordered the recount to begin will hold a hearing Wednesday on whether to stop it.

(AP Photo/John Locher)\nThree leading Republicans were asked over the weekend whether or not they agreed with Donald Trump's tweeted assertion that millions of voters had cast illegal ballots (part of Trump's effort to rebut his popular vote loss).\nTrump's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus said that such a scenario was "possible." House Speaker Paul Ryan said he didn't know if millions of illegal votes were cast, because he is "not really focused on these things." Vice-president-elect Mike Pence echoed Ryan's sentiment, saying that he didn't know that the claim was false.\nAll three should have listened to representatives from another leading Republican: Donald Trump. In court filings submitted in an effort to block recount efforts by Green Party candidate Jill Stein in Michigan and Pennsylvania, attorneys for the president-elect stated unequivocally that there was, in fact, no evidence that any voter fraud had occurred.\nThe most direct statement was made in the Trump campaign's filing in Michigan.\n"On what basis does Stein seek to disenfranchise Michigan citizens? None really, save for speculation," it reads. "All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake." The filing notes that both Michigan's Republican governor and the White House articulated confidence in the results of the election. The former refers solely to Michigan, of course, but the latter citation by Trump's lawyers argues that there was no evidence of Russian interference at the national level.\nWhy is Stein conducting a recount, the lawyers ask? "Stein aims to sow doubts regarding the legitimacy of the presidential election."\nAfter a judge rejected the state's request for a delay, Michigan election officials are expected to begin recounting presidential ballots Dec. 5 at noon. It is likely to end by Dec. 13. (Reuters)\nIn the Pennsylvania filing , the lawyers are more careful to constrain their dismissal of the idea of voter fraud to the state.\n"On what basis does Stein seek to disenfranchise the voters of the Keystone state? None really," it reads. "There is no evidence -- or even any allegation -- that any tampering with Pennsylvania's voting systems actually occurred."\nAs evidence to that end, the lawyers point to statements before the election from the secretary of state.\nWhy did the secretary of state Pedro Cortes hold a press conference in October to rebut claims that Pennsylvania's elections might be hacked? Because of unfounded claims made before the election by Donald Trump.\n"Unfortunately, in recent weeks," Cortes said at the time, "some have decided to take a different approach. Some have suggested that our system lacks integrity and security. Some have suggested that fraud is rampant and election officials at the local and state level have ill intended motives. This is not only wrong and uninformed ? it is dangerous."\nAfter the election, Trump narrowed his complaints about possible fraud to three states that he lost.\nSerious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!\n? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016\nIn none of those three states is there actually evidence of rampant voter fraud. In all three, the secretaries of state have offered the same assurances as did Cortes that no impropriety occurred. (To wit: California , New Hampshire and Virginia .)\nAfter Trump's tweets, our Aaron Blake pointed out that those?tweets set up a tricky conflict between the president-elect's?attempts?to rebut the recount efforts and his push to claim popular vote success. His lawyers clearly didn't have many concerns about waving away the idea of fraud in two states that make up 7 percent of the country's population -- and with good reason, since there's no evidence at all that rampant voter fraud occurred anywhere.\nPut another way: All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake. If Trump's lawyers can say it in a legal document, one would think that Trump's other allies could say it, too.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Burden, Kenneth R. Mayer and Charles Stewart III December 5\nNicole Kirby looks over results during a statewide presidential election recount on Thursday in Milwaukee. (Morry Gash/AP)\nThanks to the efforts of Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, a recount is underway in Wisconsin.?It is highly unlikely to change the outcome ? as Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign has stated ? but it is much more likely to overturn some conventional wisdom about counting votes. In particular, we may learn, yet again, that computers are better than humans at counting ballots.\nWisconsinâ€™s most recent experience with a statewide recount provides some useful background for the current recount. In 2011, David Prosser ran against JoAnne Kloppenburg for a seat on the state supreme court. After the initial count, Prosser was 7,316 votes ahead of Kloppenburg, out of 1.5 million votes cast. Kloppenburg demanded and received a recount. The recount added votes to both candidateâ€™s total, although more to Kloppenburgâ€™s. Ultimately, Prosser won by 7,004 votes. This is a tiny change.\nAnother way to think about it is to take the absolute difference between the number of votes for a candidate in the original count and in the recount. The absolute difference means it didnâ€™t matter whether the candidate gained or lost votes in the recount. For instance, if Candidate Smith received 100 votes in the original count and 102 votes in the recount, the discrepancy would be 2?percent. It would also be 2?percent if the candidate had 98 votes in the recount.\nBased on that calculation, the discrepancy between the initial count and the recount in the 2011 race was 0.18 percent. It would take a much larger discrepancy ? at least 0.80?percent in Clintonâ€™s favor, and more likely greater than 7?percent ? to change the outcome in Wisconsin and award its electoral votes to her. (Below we show the basis of this calculation.) Even still, winning Wisconsin would not be enough for her to win the electoral college.\nFor many advocating a recount in Wisconsin, a primary concern is that computers were involved in counting at least some of the ballots. In 2016, 90?percent of all votes were cast in municipalities that used computerized optical scanners to count votes. It seems obvious that we should be more skeptical of machines that count ballots than humans who count ballots. But the evidence suggests that machines actually do a better job.\nRepublicans and Democrats react to the announcement that Hillary Clinton's campaign plans to join a vote recount in Wisconsin initiated by former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\nRecounts help us study the accuracy of the methods that provided the initial ? and often only ? vote count in an election. If the recount is a fully accurate vote count, then we can use it to gauge the accuracy of the original count. Better yet, if we have one set of ballots that were originally counted by hand and another set of paper ballots counted by computer scanners, then we can assess the accuracy of the two methods.\nIn the only study we know of, political scientists Stephen Ansolabehere and Andrew Reeves examined every recount in New Hampshire from 1946 to 2002. From 1946 to 1962, when New Hampshire had only hand-counted paper ballots, the average discrepancy between the original count and recount was 0.83?percent. In 2002, when there were recounts in six New Hampshire races, the discrepancy was 2.5 percent in races in which the ballots were originally hand-counted, but only 0.6 percent in races in which they were machine-counted.\nCloser scrutiny revealed a race in one town, Bradford, where the hand-counting had gone terribly wrong. According to an interview with a state official, the team that was hand-counting votes in Bradford for one particular state legislative race decided to knock off for the night and never resumed counting the next day. Removing Bradfordâ€™s data reduced the average discrepancy in hand-counted jurisdictions to 0.87?percent, but this is still higher than the discrepancy in races with machine-counted ballots.\nThe same finding emerges in Wisconsin. When we analyzed the 2011 Wisconsin recount, we found that the average discrepancy for scanner-counted paper ballots was 0.17?percent, compared with 0.28?percent for hand-counted paper. In other words, both methods are highly accurate, but scanners are slightly more so.\nWhy would scanners be superior? As the Bradford story illustrates, scanners donâ€™t get tired or bored as easily as humans do. Human counters also feel pressure to get the job done quickly and accurately, which creates stress that machines do not feel.\nOf course, even if scanners are more accurate on average, this wonâ€™t always be true. A machine that malfunctions could cause a big discrepancy.\nLeaders of the Green Party in Wisconsin and Hillary Clinton's campaaign said that it will participate in the recount, exploring whether there was any "outside interference" in the election results. (Reuters)\nHuman error can also occur when scanners are used. In the 2011 Wisconsin recount, the jurisdiction with the greatest discrepancy between the original count and the recount was the town of Larrabee, which recorded 322 total votes on election night and 391 (69 more) in the recount. The reason is that on election night the results from one of the townâ€™s scanners were not written down on the tally sheet that was sent to the county clerk. Thus, the problem was not with the scanner but with the procedure to transfer the results from the scanner to the paper report form.\nOf course, past patterns may not apply to this recount. And regardless of the recountâ€™s outcome, we believe it is valuable to scrutinize the accuracy of vote-counting. The big downside in Wisconsin is that a full recount takes a lot of time and resources. This is actually a good reason to favor what are called â€œrisk-limiting auditsâ€? rather than statewide recounts to verify election results when there is no hard evidence of widespread fraud or malfeasance. Risk-limiting audits, advocated by mathematicians such as Philip Stark and Ron Rivest , use a small number of randomly selected ballots to test whether the original vote count most probably called the correct winner.\nBut with a full recount underway regardless, all eyes will be focused on Wisconsin for the next few weeks. We should expect three things: the recount will discover only small discrepancies between the election night totals; both methods of counting ballots ? hand and scanners ? will prove highly accurate; and scanners will be more accurate than humans.\nStephen Ansolabehere is professor of government at Harvard University.? Barry C. Burden is the Lyons Family Chair in Electoral Politics at the University of Wisconsin?at Madison and director of its Elections Research Center.? Kenneth R. Mayer is professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin?at Madison. Charles Stewart III is Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Political Science at MIT and co-director of the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project.\n[Our estimates of how large of a discrepancy is needed to change the Wisconsin outcome are based on the following. Clinton currently trails Trump by 22,177 votes.? If the recount revealed only 22,178 new votes for Clinton and none for Trump, she would win by one vote. There are currently 1,404,000 votes for Trump and 1,381,823 for Clinton. The calculation then is (22,178 + 0)/(1,404,000+1,381,823) = 0.80 percent.? More likely, however, both Trump and Clinton would gain votes. Letâ€™s say that Clinton got 55 percent of the new votes uncovered in the recount. Then, to get a net 22,178 new votes for Clinton, Wisconsin would have to uncover 199,594 new votes ? for 110,886 for Clinton and 88,708 for Trump.? This works out to a discrepancy of 7.2 percent.]\nMore from Monkey Cage:?\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\nWith a recount of the Wisconsin presidential results moving forward and another recount possible in Pennsylvania, I reached out to Marc Elias , general counsel for Hillary Clinton's campaign, for some answers. Why was Clinton taking part in a recount pushed for by Green Party candidate Jill Stein? Was there any reasonable hope the results might change? ?And, if not, wasn't this whole thing the opposite of Clinton's post-election message that the country needed to come together? Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited, is below.\nFIX: Explain why you at the Clinton campaign decided to participate actively in Jill Steinâ€™s recount in Wisconsin even though you didnâ€™t find any major anomalies in your own post-election research into potential hacking or fraud?\nElias: First, we are going to participate because itâ€™s a recount involving our election.? We made clear that we were not planning to initiate any recounts.? However, Jill Stein has now filed for a recount in Wisconsin.? As one of the candidates in the race we are necessarily involved in the process and will participate.? We do not expect to challenge ballots, or delay the electors from being certified by the state. ?Our role will be to observe the process and ensure that Secretary Clinton and her votersâ€™ interests are protected and that there is an accurate vote count.? As a side note, I have been surprised at how much attention my Medium post has received and even more surprised by some of the ways it has been interpreted.? ?Let me be clear: We have not asked for a recount.? We have not sought a recount.? We have not pushed for a recount.? What we have done is say that if there is going to be a recount, we will participate in the ways I have described.\nFIX: Did your canvas and research turn up ANY signs of hacking? Widespread fraud?\nElias: We have received lots of information and opinions from many experts -- including data scientists and computer security experts -- that hacking of the system is?possible.? We did not receive any evidence that it actually happened.? Obviously, we know that the Russian state entities hacked into the Democratic Party.? And we know that they hacked into several prominent Democrats' emails, including the Clinton campaign chairmanâ€™s.? We also know that there were pre-election efforts to break into various state voter files.? Thus, we believe it was a prudent and necessary step for us to take to see whether they could have also hacked into the voting systems.? To date we do not have any actionable evidence to suggest that this happened.? With respect to fraud, we have found no evidence of widespread fraud in connect with the elections in these states or any other in 2016.\nFIX: How much reasonable hope ? if any ? should Clinton supporters have in the possibility of the results in Wisconsin (or other states like Michigan and Pennsylvania) being overturned? Is there any historical precedent for that happening given the margins in the states?\nElias: Our participation is not meant to signal to anyone that we believe the results of the election will change.? I have been involved in many recounts and there is no precedent for a recount changing the results of an election with the margins present in these states.? If the campaign thought that the results could change based on a recount, we would have sought them.? We didnâ€™t.\nFIX:?How surprised were you at Donald Trumpâ€™s tweetstorm about vote fraud?Sunday?night ? And in your own research did you find any evidence that backs up his claim about voting irregularities in Virginia, New Hampshire and California?\nElias: I would like to say I was surprised, but I canâ€™t say that I am.? Hillary Clinton won at least 2.2 million more popular votes than Trump . Unfortunately for our campaign the popular vote is not how we choose presidents, we do so through the electoral college. ? But it is clear that Secretary Clinton handily won the most votes from the American people.? The fact that Mr. Trump cannot accept that fact is troubling.\nWe found absolutely no evidence of fraud or irregularities in the states you list, or any other.? Of course, he is free to file for his own recounts or contests and if he does I promise we will participate in those as well.\nFIX: Finish this sentence: â€œA recount in Wisconsin is a ____________ decision.â€? Now, explain.\nElias: "Jill Stein."\nDr. Stein sought this recount, not Secretary Clinton.? Indeed, Dr. Stein has also criticized our decision to participate in the recount.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

Pat McCrory (R) concedes closely contested governor's race	2016-12-07 00:00:00	By Amber Phillips December 5 Follow byamberphillips\nIt's official: The last ??and most heated ? outstanding gubernatorial race of the year has come to a close, with incumbent GOP Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina conceding in a Monday video message to Democratic challenger Roy Cooper.\nIncumbent GOP Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina conceded in a video message Dec. 5 to Democratic challenger Roy Cooper. (Office of Governor Pat McCrory)\nâ€œDespite continued questions that should be answered regarding the voting process, I personally believe that the majority of our citizens have spoken,â€? McCrory said.\nMcCrory is now the first North Carolina governor to lose reelection. His concession brings to a close a nearly month-long saga that seemed to grow more ? not less ? convoluted and heated by the day, and a four-year governorship that was marked by flash points on LGBT rights, police brutality and gerrymandering.\nHis defeat is?also a rare bright spot in an otherwise dark 2016 election cycle for Democrats: McCrory's?loss makes him the only incumbent governor to lose this year ? and one of just a handful of sitting governors to lose in the modern era.\nCooper, North Carolina's attorney general, thought this election was over on?election night. He claimed victory with a?4,000-vote lead out of 4.2 million votes cast. But McCrory refused to concede, citing unproven suspicions about manual vote counts in Democratic-leaning Durham County. McCrory requested a recount, and?he and his allies spent weeks scouring voter rolls across the state for evidence of fraud.\nBut?McCrory's voter fraud challenges failed to present any evidence of the kind of widespread voter fraud that would swing the election by thousands of votes. At least eight Republican-controlled boards of elections rejected all or most of the challenges because of lack of evidence.\nAnd as provisional and absentee ballots were counted, Cooper's lead surged past 10,000 votes, which is the state's maximum vote margin to conduct a recount.\nSo confident was Cooper of his lead that his campaign announced a transition team in the midst of the recount drama.\nRoy Cooper, the Democratic challenger in North Carolina's gubernatorial race, released this video statement on Nov. 18. (Roy Cooper)\nâ€œIt will be the honor of my life to serve this great state,â€? Cooper said in a statement Monday after McCrory conceded.\nMcCroryâ€™s contest-every-vote strategy came?under criticism from election officials and newspaper editorial boards. In one county, a dead person they claimed voted was actually alive. In another county, two alleged convicted felons were not felons at all. In another, an election protest was thrown out after the GOP lawyer who filed it didnâ€™t show up until after the hearing ended.\nâ€œIt puts a cloud over the integrity of the election process of North Carolina,â€? Rhonda Amoroso, a Republican State Board of Elections member, told? the Raleigh News & Observer :\n[ From bathroom policy to protests, North Carolina's governor can't seem to escape the hot seat ]\nThere was also a remote possibility that the GOP-dominated legislature could step in to try to settle this. But the chips would have had to fall a very certain way for that to happen, and GOP legislators had indicated that theyâ€™d be reluctant to get involved, even to try to save a governor from their own party.\nMcCroryâ€™s camp said that given the closeness of the race, it made sense to wait until every last vote was counted for either side to declare victory.\nIn McCrory's concession, he reiterated that he still had concerns about voter integrity.\nThe final year of McCrory's four-year tenure was marked by?drama surrounding some of the country's touchiest subjects. Prominent LGBT rights groups got involved in trying to unseat McCrory?after he signed a bill this spring that limited which public bathrooms transgender people could use and blocked municipalitiesâ€™ ability to pass anti-LGBT-discrimination laws.\nMcCrory's approval rating dropped ?after the law was signed, and backlash to it reverberated across the business, sports and entertainment communities. PayPal pulled out of a deal with the state, and Bruce Springsteen canceled a concert there. The NBA and the NCAA also canceled their moneymaking basketball tournament games in the state.\nThe boiling?debate over the bathroom law had just dropped to a simmer this summer when McCrory was forced into yet another defensive position, this time over another controversial bill he signed into law.\nIn July, three judges on a federal appeals court struck down the state's 2013 voter ID law, writing: â€œThe new provisions target African Americans, with almost surgical precision.â€?\nThe court ruling striking down the law was a huge win for voting rights advocates, who had been playing whack-a-mole with voter ID laws across the country. And it was a blow to McCrory just months before the election: North Carolina is fast becoming one of the most crucial swing states, thanks in part to an?increasingly politically active African American community whose members?overwhelmingly vote Democratic.\nThen, in September, there was? violence , and perhaps the?biggest test of?McCrory's term, when 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was fatally shot by a police officer outside a Charlotte apartment complex. Scott's killing hit a nerve in North Carolina's largest city, and McCrory declared a state of emergency as protests, some of which turned violent, filled the streets. It was the most intense reaction in several years to a police shooting.\npolitics\n	washingtonpost	U.S.

(Brittany Greeson for The Washington Post)\nMichigan Attorney General Bill Schuette filed another round of criminal charges Tuesday in? the ongoing water crisis in Flint, the latest action in a nearly year-long investigation to hold accountable those?responsible for a disaster that exposed thousands of children to dangerously high lead levels.\nSchuette announced felony?charges against four people, including two?former state-appointed emergency managers who oversaw a disastrous switch of the cityâ€™s drinking water source to the Flint River. Darnell Earley, whom Gov. Rick Snyder (R)?put in charge of the cityâ€™s finances from late 2013 through early 2015, and?Gerald Ambrose, who held the emergency manager position through April 2015, could face decades in prison.\nProsecutors allege that the?emergency managers conspired with two Flint employees, public works Superintendent Howard Croft and utilities Administrator Daugherty Johnson, to enter into a contract under false pretenses that bound the city to use the river for its drinking water, even though the local water?plant was in no condition to properly deliver safe water to residents.\nEven after the officials were told?repeatedly?that the Flint water department wasnâ€™t ready to make the switch in 2014 and that the city should keep getting its water from Detroit, investigators say Earley and Ambrose pushed the change forward in a bid to save money. The decision ultimately exposed children and other residents to lead-tainted water and resulted in the death of a dozen people from Legionnaireâ€™s disease.\n[ â€˜If I could afford to leave, I would.â€™ In Flint, a water crisis with no end in sight. ]\nâ€œThis fixation [on money] has cost lives. This fixation came at the expense of protecting the health and safety of Flint,â€? Schuette said in a news conference Tuesday. â€œItâ€™s all about numbers over people, money over health. . . . Flint was a casualty of arrogance, disdain and a failure of management. An absence of accountability.â€?\nThe four men?charged Tuesday all? face felony charges of false pretenses and conspiracy to commit false pretenses. Earley and Ambrose also face charges of willful neglect of duty and misconduct in office.\nInvestigators have now filed 43 criminal charges against 13 current and former state and local officials.\nIn April, Schuette announced initial charges against three state and local workers for their roles in the water crisis. That included more than?a dozen separate counts against two officials at the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, as well as a Flint water quality?supervisor. They were accused of?misconduct in office and tampering with evidence, as well as for willful neglect of duty.\nIn June, Schuette?filed civil charges against two engineering firms that allegedly â€œbotchedâ€? their work on the water supply system, contributing to the crisis.\nThe following month, six more state employees were charged with misconduct in office for their alleged roles in contaminating?Flintâ€™s water supply.?Those?charges, against three Department of Health and Human Services employees and three from the Department of Environmental Quality,?included claims that some had hid or disregarded test results showing high lead levels in the blood of Flint residents?and had tampered with water test results sent to federal officials.\n[ Flintâ€™s water crisis reveals government failures at every level ]\nSo far, Schuette said Tuesday, some defendants have entered pleas, while other cases are proceeding toward trial.\nThe disaster in Flint, a once-thriving industrial city of about 95,000, began nearly three years ago. For decades, the city had used water piped in from Lake Huron, with anti-corrosion chemicals added along the way by Detroit water officials.\nIn April 2014, with the city under the control of Earley, an emergency manager appointed by the governor, officials followed through on an earlier decision?to switch to the Flint River to save money. According to prosecutors, they did so while ignoring?â€œwarnings and test resultsâ€? that the plant was unable to guarantee safe water to residents. The stateâ€™s environmental quality agency also failed to?ensure that corrosion-control additives were part of the new water supply, which allowed lead and other substances such as iron to leach from aging pipes.\nResidents began to complain almost immediately of brown, smelly water that burned their eyes and left them with rashes. Public officials repeatedly issued reassurances that the water was safe. Only after researchers in Flint publicly disclosed tests showing spikes in lead levels in childrenâ€™s blood did Flint switch back to Detroit water. Even now, more than a year later, the tap water there has not been declared safe to drink, and many city residents?are still drinking, bathing and cooking with bottled water.\nWhile investigators? Tuesday said their inquiry is beginning to wind down, they vowed to?press on until the reckoning they promised nearly a year ago is complete.\nâ€œWeâ€™re much closer to the end than we are to the beginning, but weâ€™re not at the end,â€? said Andrew Arena, the chief investigator in the probe. â€œThere are some people out there right now who know that theyâ€™ve done wrong, and they know weâ€™re coming after them.

But some Democrats, fearing that the results of such an investigation would never be released to the public, are pushing the formation of an independent body of outsiders modeled on the Sept. 11 commission.\nStill other Republicans would like to see a bipartisan investigation in Congress ? or better yet, form entirely new congressional committees and subcommittees to dig into the matter. A different group of Democrats would like to see a very unusual bicameral probe into whether Russia allegedly hacked the Democratic National Committee emails and leaked them to WikiLeaks in a concerted effort to damage Hillary Clinton.\nThe cacophony of competing voices on Capitol Hill could hamstring the rare, near-universal commitment to dig into allegations Russia interfered with the 2016 election. It may also allow Trump to discredit lawmakersâ€™ efforts as overly partisan ? the president-elect has called charges that Russia interfered in the election to benefit his candidacy â€œ ridiculous. â€?\nIn public statements, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) have both focused on channeling any Russia investigation through their intelligence committees.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington on Dec. 8. (Cliff Owen/AP)\nMcConnell on Monday said the Senate Intelligence Committee ? of which he is a symbolic member as the chamberâ€™s GOP leader ? is â€œmore than capable of conducting a complete review of the matter.â€? Ryan agreed, saying that a special panel is unnecessary because the House Intelligence Committee is â€œworking diligently on the cyberthreats posed by foreign governments and terrorist organizations.â€?\nBut if history is any guide, those investigations could be highly classified and damaged by partisan infighting. Their findings may be subject to presidential review and closely held by top lawmakers, the intelligence community and senior aides in the Trump White House.\nâ€œThere certainly is a danger in this being swept under the rug,â€? said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden (D), an Intelligence Committee member. â€œThere must be urgency and transparency in getting facts out into the open, whether theyâ€™re being investigated by the intelligence committees, other standing congressional committees, a joint committee or an independent commission.â€?\nâ€œOne of the goals of this investigation should be to release as much information as possible, while protecting sources and methods,â€? said Virginia Sen. Mark R. Warner, who will be the ranking Democrat on Intelligence starting in January.\nThe closest parallel may well be the so-called â€œtorture report,â€? produced in 2014 by the Senate Intelligence Committee documenting CIA treatment of suspected terrorist detainees in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Despite then-chairwoman Dianne Feinsteinâ€™s (D-Calif.) intense desire to see the full 7,000-page report released, all but the 528-page executive summary has remained private.\n[ Senate report on CIA program details brutality, dishonesty ]\nThat panel devolved into near chaos when the torture report was released without the support of Republicans, including the incoming chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.). When he became chairman, Burr demanded the return of all copies of the report, apparently concerned that it could be obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.\nAt a briefing, Dec. 12, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the Obama administration supports reviews by congress of suspected Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election. Earnest said intelligence agencies have been cooperating closely with lawmakers from both parties. (Reuters)\nPresident Obama this week made moves to preserve the report when he leaves office without ensuring that it immediately becomes available to the public.\nObama has also taken steps to collect information about the CIA allegations before he leaves office on Jan.?20, ordering a â€œfull reviewâ€? of the charges be delivered to him before he leaves office. Separately, a group of senior Democratic senators is pushing Obama to declassify information about Russiaâ€™s alleged election-related hacking operations before Trump is inaugurated.\nRussian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s spokesman on Tuesday issued a blunt denial of U.S. allegations that the Kremlin intervened to help Trump win the presidency, and expressed hope that Moscow will be able to â€œresetâ€? its relationship with the new administration.\nIn an interview with RT television, Dmitry Peskov dismissed the findings by the CIA that the Russian government aided Trump ? and other assertions that it was interfering in upcoming German elections ? as â€œabsolute nonsense.â€?\nThe battle over how to investigate Russian influence is likely to bleed over into the confirmation hearings of ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson , who was nominated on Tuesday by Trump to be his secretary of state. Several Republicans in the Senate, which must vote to confirm Tillerson, expressed concern over ties Tillerson has to Putin, who decorated him with the Kremlinâ€™s Order of Friendship in 2013.\nâ€œWhile Rex Tillerson is a respected businessman, I have serious concerns about his nomination,â€? Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which will hold confirmation hearings, said in a statement. â€œThe next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of Americaâ€™s interests, and will be a forceful advocate for Americaâ€™s foreign policy goals to the president, within the administration, and on the world stage.â€?\nMcConnell, however, backed Tillerson, saying, â€œI look forward to supportingâ€? his nomination.\nThe House and Senate intelligence panels have already had briefings from various officials pertaining to allegations that Russia interfered in the elections. But in the House, the committee's chairman, Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), has also criticized Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. for presenting the committee with a different take on Russiaâ€™s hacking activities than the CIA assessment that the Kremlin interfered to help Trump win.\nThe committee â€œhas an urgent need to accurately understand the current IC assessment of alleged Russian cyberactivities relating to the election, and any disagreements among IC components,â€? Nunes wrote in a letter to Clapper on Monday.\nIn a separate statement Monday, Nunes also said that he â€œdo[es] not see any benefit in opening further investigations.â€?\nBut so far, those committees havenâ€™t made any of their current information public, and they may not do so if they broaden their reach.\n[ Secret CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win the White House ]\nTo avoid such a situation, Senate Democrats ? including Feinstein ? have called for an independent commission of experts, appointed by congressional leaders, to investigate the allegations. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also supports that approach, in which both sides would have subpoena power.\nSuch a committee would be structured like the Sept. 11 commission, with both partiesâ€™ leaders appointing one to two non-lawmakers to sit on it. The president would not be allowed to appoint panel members, a courtesy often extended during the creation of other commissions, as Democrats believe Trump would have a conflict of interest because of the nature of the allegations. Democrats want a report made public 18 months after such a panel begins its work.\nMcConnell, Ryan and other committee leaders ? including Trumpâ€™s most vocal critics on the Hill ? have been dodging direct questions about whether they believe the CIAâ€™s assessment that Putin, whom Trump frequently praised during the campaign, was behind the hacks the CIA thinks were intended to help Trump prevail.\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has said â€œthereâ€™s very little doubtâ€? Russia intervened in the elections and has derided Trump for casting doubt on that conclusion, suggested that in this one instance, maybe the CIA is wrong.\nâ€œThe CIA has not always been exactly right, to say the least,â€? he said.\nIn the wake of the CIA allegations, however, McCain and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) joined calls from incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) to initiate a bipartisan probe.\nFor McCain, the election is one part of a larger examination that must focus on national security risks posed by cyberthreats, particularly related to the military. Officials already suspect that Russia may have been behind a major email breach at the Pentagon last year.\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who chairs
 the Foreign Relations Committee, has also pledged to dig into the allegations of Russian hacking next year. And Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who chairs subcommittees on the Judiciary and Appropriations committees, has also committed to investigating Russiaâ€™s alleged intervention in the elections, as well as other nefarious activities across the globe, including in the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.\nDavid Filipov in Moscow and Kelsey Snell in Washington contributed to this report.\n	washingtonpost	U.S.
