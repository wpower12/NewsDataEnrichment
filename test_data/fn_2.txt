A change.org petition that calls for Averyâ€™s pardon has also gained 268,000 signatures and counting since going live in December.\nDespite all the conversation and attention, the show hasnâ€™t drawn hordes of tourists to the county to see its setting, like Magnolia Bakery did for â€œSex and the Cityâ€? and Tomâ€™s Restaurant did for â€œSeinfeld.â€?\nBut, at least as compared with pre-â€?Murderer,â€? there is a bit of new interest in the area.\nâ€œBetween 25 to 40 vehicles have come up my driveway,â€? Chuck Avery, Stevenâ€™s brother, tells The Post of visitors who have motored up to Averyâ€™s Auto Salvage ? the family business in Two Rivers where Steven worked ? in the past few weeks. But they donâ€™t stay for long. â€œThey turn around,â€? Chuck adds.\nBut one Arkansas couple who recently visited neighboring Sheboygan County actually dropped by the shop to bring the Averys two pizzas for dinner and to give Stevenâ€™s mother, Dolores, a big hug.\nDoes this mean that more and more travelers will head to the salvage yard to pose for photos and treat the location as a spectacle?\nâ€œIâ€™m kind of wary about that,â€? Chuck admits.\nOf course, the few intrepid fan-travelers have captured their show-related sightings on Instagram.\nA photo posted by Matt Bacaling (@bacaling) on\nJan 3, 2016 at 11:15am PST\nJason Ring, the president of the Manitowoc Area Visitor & Convention Bureau ? whose 3,000-square-foot center draws 25,000 to 30,000 travelers annually ? says he believes itâ€™s possible for these â€œMurdererâ€?-inspired visits to increase.\n	foxnews	U.S.

So far, the family has reportedly collected $2,100 raised though the site and says an additional $1,200 has been sent to their home.\nTMZ reports the money will be used for legal fees and a private investigator.\nBut Ken Kratz, who prosecuted Avery, is fighting back with what he says is evidence that the Netflix docu-series ignored.\n[SPOILER ALERT: The following contains spoilers from "Making a Murderer."]\nKratz sent nine separate points to the TheWrap.com , including the claim that Avery told an inmate during his 18 years in prison that he was planning on building a "torture chamber" so he could rape, torture and kill young women upon his release. Kratz said the inmate also revealed Avery told him the best way to get rid of a body was to "burn it" because heat destroys DNA evidence. The body of the photographer Avery was convicted of murdering, Teresa Halbach, was found burned at Avery's Auto Salvage.\nKratz also told TheWrap.com that Halbach's phone, camera and PDA were found 20 feet from Avery's door, burned in his barrel, but said the documentary did not include this information.\nKratz suggested that Avery "targeted" Halbach citing phone records that show three calls from Avery's phone to Teresa's phone the day she was last seen. The prosecutor said that Halbach was "creeped out" by Avery who allegedly opened his door "just wearing a towel" when she visited his property for a photo shoot for AutoTrader magazine.\n"She [went to her employer and] said she would not go back because she was scared of him," he told People magazine in an e-mail.\nAvery claims that police planted the evidence and framed him for Halbach's murder. However, Kratz countered that Avery's DNA was found under the hood of Halbach's car.\n"How did his DNA get under the hood if Avery never touched her car? Do the cops have a vial of Avery's sweat?"\nAvery's defense team alleged that the blood found in Halbach's car may have been planted from an 11-year-old vial of Avery's blood.\nAvery's defense attorneys also claim that the bullet recovered at Avery's garage was planted by police, which Kratz denies.\n"Ballistics said the bullet found in the garage was fired by Avery's rifle, which was in a police evidence locker since Nov. 6, 2005," Kratz told People. "If the cops planted the bullet, how did they get one fired from [Avery's] gun? This rifle, hanging over Avery's bed, is the source of the bullet found in the garage, with Teresa's DNA on it. The bullet had to be fired before Nov. 5."\nKratz resigned from his position as Calumet County District Attorney in 2010 following a sexting scandal. He admitted to sending suggestive messages to a crime victim. He said he had a prescription drug problem at the time and said it's "exceedingly unfair to use that to characterize me as morally unfit" in "Making a Murderer."\n"Making a Murderer" filmmaker Laura Ricciardi disputed Kratz's claims that the film was made as part of Avery's defense and left out key facts that would cast Avery in a bad light.\nâ€œOur opinion is that we included the stateâ€™s most compelling evidence,â€? Ricciardi, who made the film with Moira Demos, told The New York Times .\nThe filmmakers said they offered to interview Kratz for the film, but that he declined. He said he did so because he didn't think the film was balanced.\nAvery previously spent 18 years in prison for sexual assault before he was exonerated and released in 2003 based on DNA evidence.

Using the subtitled phone chats, strangely compelling cello sounds and Wisconsin accents that make "Murderer" so distinctive, the clip chronicles a staff member's attempt to get Meyers to come back to "30 Rock."\n"Yah, Seth? the unknown voice says. "Yah, you gotta come back. Ya know?"\n"I've only been out two weeks," Meyers says. "Supposing I don't wanna come back."\nThe bit ends with a photo of Meyers rocking a bushy beard that makes him look like man-of-the-moment Steven Avery.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

And what's next?\nQ: SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?\nA: Avery made national headlines in 2003 when he was released after spending nearly two decades behind bars after being wrongfully convicted of rape. Two years later, Avery and Dassey were charged with killing Halbach, who visited the Avery family salvage yard to take photos of a minivan on Halloween. Her bones and belongings were found burned near Avery's trailer. Both were convicted and sentenced to life terms, but only Dassey is eligible for parole ? in 2048.\nQ: WHY HAS THE DOCUMENTARY BEEN SO POPULAR?\nA: Its release was impeccably timed. It was released before Christmas, while much of the nation was on holiday break and had time to delve into a 10-hour series. Also, it comes on the heels of the popular podcast "Serial," which lays out a complex legal case and has generated intense social media participation.\nQ: WHAT EXACTLY IS IN THE DOCUMENTARY?\nA: The documentary strongly suggests the possibility that Manitowoc County sheriff's deputies planted evidence against Avery, including a key found in his bedroom and blood found in the victim's vehicle. But Sheriff Robert Hermann denied that Tuesday. "They did not plant evidence," Hermann said. "I trust them 100 percent. Quite frankly, I think justice was served in this case." He said he watched the series, and added: "I call it a film. It's missing a lot of important pieces of evidence."\nQ: WHY DO AUTHORITES SAY IT'S BIASED?\nA: The series spends much of its time detailing the perspective of Avery and Dassey family members. The case's special prosecutor, Ken Kratz, refused to comment to The Associated Press, but he has told other media outlets that the documentary ignores the majority of the physical evidence. The omissions include the fact that Avery's DNA was found on the hood latch on Halbach's SUV, which was hidden on the salvage lot. Kratz has also said a bullet fired from Avery's gun was found in his garage with Halbach's DNA on it.\nQ: WHAT DO THE FILMMAKERS SAY?\nA: Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos have stood by their work. They said in an email to the AP through Netflix representatives that critics who might say they intentionally omitted or underplayed key evidence to make the series more entertaining or tragic are wrong. "Those accusations are untrue and unfounded," the statement said.\nQ: THERE'S AN ONLINE PETITION SEEKING A PARDON ? COULD IT WORK?\nA: It seems unlikely for a lot of reasons. For one thing, the request posted on Change.org started by petitioning President Barack Obama, who has no such authority in this type of case, since it's not a federal matter. The petition, which recently was rewritten to include Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and remove the word "presidential" from the text of the appeal. Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick said Tuesday in an email to the AP that the governor hasn't watched the series and that "early in his administration, Gov. Walker made the decision not to issue pardons. Those who feel they have been wrongly convicted can seek to have their convictions overturned by a higher court."\nQ: WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIMS?\nA: Halbach's brother Mike Halbach has declined comment since releasing a statement from the family before the documentary became public. "Having just passed the 10-year anniversary of the death of our daughter and sister, Teresa, we are saddened to learn that individuals and corporations continue to create entertainment and to seek profit from our loss," the statement read. "We continue to hope that the story of Teresa's life brings goodness to the world."\nThe victim from the 1985 rape case has declined comment.\nQ: WHAT HAS THE REACTION BEEN LIKE?\nA: It's been all over the map. Celebrities have tweeted about how into the series they are, late night talk show host Seth Meyers spoofed it and fake Twitter accounts have been set up for some of the main players in the case. However, Sheriff Hermann said some of his officers have received threats in emails and voicemails. He said one was from a convicted felon who said an officer should "take his own life, or else he'd come up there and take it for him." Hermann said Tuesday that threat was passed along to Florida authorities to investigate.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Bill Cosby leaves the Cheltenham Township Police Department where he was processed after being arraigned on a felony charge of aggravated indecent assault in Elkins Park, Pa.?(The Associated Press)\nBill Cosby's attraction to Andrea Constand began the moment he spied her across a Temple University gym in about 2002. The flirting ? some would say grooming ? began almost immediately.\nWhen Constand, a Temple women's basketball staffer, mentioned that her back was bothering her, the 66-year-old comedian offered his "layman's" fix in the women's locker room.\nClick here to subscribe to FOX411â€™s?YouTube?channel\n"It's one where she gets on my back with her back and her arms come under mine and I grab her and I say, 'Now you relax,'" Cosby said in a 2005 deposition. "I go up and I come down and I give that jolt and it's supposed to line the vertebrae."\nThe friendship that followed between Temple's most famous booster and the then-31-year-old employee colors the sex-assault prosecution that starts in earnest Tuesday, when Cosby's lawyers will ask a judge to throw out charges stemming from a 2004 encounter at his suburban Philadelphia home.\nIn Cosby's mind, Constand had reacted "very, very favorably" to him the day they met at Temple's arena.\nA university trustee, he began inviting her to dinner at his home, at first with others but later alone. Cosby was both a sounding board and someone who could open doors for a woman considering a career change. In November 2003, he summoned Constand to the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut, where he was performing, and arranged for her to have dinner with a casino executive in his suite. But he voiced frustration when she failed to follow through on his job leads.\n"Here's a mentor, Bill Cosby, who is in the business ? Bill Cosby, who happens to know something about what to do ? and Andrea is not picking up on it," Cosby said in the deposition, part of the sex-assault lawsuit Constand filed in 2005.\nIn the deposition, Cosby paints himself as Constand's friend, mentor and occasional partner in sex "play" that stopped short of intercourse, lest she fall in love with him.\nConstand's lawyers have since pointed out that she is gay and was dating a woman at the time.\nBasketball, a common bond between them, had taken Constand from a standout high school career in Toronto to a 1996 NIT championship with the University of Arizona to semi-pro ball in Europe and finally a job with Temple women's basketball program.\nBy her third season, though, Constand was restless, wondering if this was the end of the road for her life in basketball. She spoke frequently about it to Cosby, during phone calls, at social events and during the approximately half-dozen visits she made to his Cheltenham home.\nCosby, in the deposition, described at least two separate nights when they engaged in sex play there ? the first time, after she had four drinks, and the second time, after he gave her unidentified pills. (Cosby said he never drank or did illegal drugs, although he acknowledged getting quaaludes in the 1970s to use on women he hoped to seduce.)\nThe criminal case involves the second night, in January 2004.\nCosby said: "Andrea came to the house. ... We talked about Temple University. We talked about her position. And then I went upstairs and I got three pills ... because she was talking about stress. ... We sat for 15 or 20 minutes talking. I then said, 'Let's go into the living room.' ... I asked her to have a sit down on the sofa. We were still talking. But then we began to neck and we began to touch and we began to feel and kiss and kiss back."\nCosby described the "digital penetration" that followed as something of a favor, to help her unwind.\n"I was hoping (it) had been a sort of a contribution to happiness, friendship, a moment that we shared," Cosby said.\nConstand later said she was too drugged to remember it clearly.\nCosby, in a taped phone call with Constand and her distraught mother a year later, confirmed that he gave her pills and described the sex act.\n"Tell your mother you were awake. Tell your mother about the orgasm. Tell your mother how we talked," Cosby begged on the phone call.\nOver the next few days, his agents and handlers made a flurry of calls to their family home to offer an educational fund or suggest they meet him at his next gig in Miami. The Constands instead gave the tape to police in Canada, who referred the case to Pennsylvania investigators.\nThen-Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce Castor declined to press charges in what he viewed as a "he said, she said" case.\nWhen a federal judge released portions of Cosby's civil deposition last year, prosecutors re-opened the case. District Attorney Kevin Steele weighed Cosby's testimony, and the dozens of similar accusations that have followed, and filed charges last month before the 12-year statute of limitations expired.\nDefense lawyers will argue Tuesday that Cosby had a deal that he would never be charged. In an unusual twist, Castor will be their key witness.\nThe AP generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they agree to have their names published, as Constand has done.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

It appears voters still going for Trump -- Trump getting 47 percent of the already voted crowd compared to Rubioâ€™s 22 percent.\nSo far, the only candidate whose' taken on Trump and continued to do well is Ted Cruz. On the other hand, maybe the smartest person of all has been John Kasich, who as he says is sometimes the only adult in the room. How many adults will we see tonight at the GOP debate?\n?\nGretchen Carlson currently serves as anchor of FOX News Channel's (FNC) "The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson" (weekdays 2-3PM/ET).

That was her 10-year long caring for the Ronald Reagan we didnâ€™t know, the Ronald Reagan whose authority and intellect diminished as his mind was destroyed by Alzheimerâ€™s. From all accounts she gave him the same love and attention she did before he came down with the disease. Maybe even more so.\nThe reason I especially appreciate her final devotion to her spouse is because I, like many other Americans, can identify with it. My parents are going through a similar experience. My mom has Alzheimerâ€™s or perhaps severe dementiaâ€¦you canâ€™t really be sure which it is until after death. The bottom line is, she rarely recognizes those around her, she hasnâ€™t been able to put a sentence together for more than 2 years, and about three months ago, she lost her ability to walk.\nBut what she hasnâ€™t lost is the love of the man she married 66 years agoâ€¦my dad. I really donâ€™t think the two of them have ever loved each other more than they do now.\nRelated Image\nExpand / Contract\nThe author's parents ((Courtesy of the author))\nFortunately theyâ€™ve been careful with their money and can afford a full-time helper to move my mother around and see to her basic needs. But my father is never far awayâ€¦eating with her, talking to her, or just silently holding her hand and kissing it.\nAs hard as it is to care for a beloved whoâ€™s struck by this, there is a joyfulness in my parentsâ€™ house. They have made the wonderful discovery that while brain power can disappear, the soul (and the love that comes out of it) is still visibleâ€¦in some ways more clearly than ever. My motherâ€™s sweet and loving spirit comes through in her smile, in her eyes, and in an occasional sentence jumble, which invariably has the word â€œloveâ€? in it. My father lives for those moments. I do, too.\nMy father is two years older than my mother, and he has a host of familiar ailments that come with age, including bad knees and kidneys. But his mind is good, and his caring for my mother these past several years has been the most heroic thing Iâ€™ve ever seen him do. I have a new-found respect for the man, as Iâ€™m sure the Reagan children developed for their mom. And to develop a renewed love and respect for your parents at the end of their life is a real blessing, and helps children fulfill their obligations with joy rather than out of a begrudging sense of duty.\nNancy Reagan Timeline | PrettyFamous\nOf course there are many frustrations that come with caring for a spouse hobbled by a lost mind. And Nancy Reagan was not hesitant about sharing details of that burden. But there is a beauty to behold between couples who have devoted their lives to each other. ..even when one of them gets sick. And the prolonged care that Nancy Reagan gave to her husband must have been beautiful to see. Of course I never saw them together in the final years. But as I see my folks this weekend, I will think of the Reaganâ€™s, and their deep love that, like my parentsâ€™ love, endured through a cloudy mind.\nGod bless Nancy Reagan. God bless Ronald Reagan. And God bless their eternal love.\nRest in peace.\nDavid Asman joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in 1997 and currently serves as host of "Forbes on FOX," a weekend half-hour program that offers an informative look at the business week (Saturday from 11:00-11:30 AM/ET).

Commentators have spent all kinds of ink and airtime trying to â€œblameâ€? the media, the culture, and the Republican Party itself for Trumpâ€™s dominance in the primaries so far.\nIn fact, Obama soon pivoted to faulting the GOP?which happens to be a prime Hillary talking point. And no, I am not shocked that he is trying to help his former secretary of State (who he pretty obviously favors over Bernie Sanders) in the race to succeed him.\nObama accused the Republican Party of â€œcreating an environment where somebody like a Donald Trump can thrive. Heâ€™s just doing more of what has been done for the last 7-1/2 years.â€? Then he zeroed in on immigration: â€œItâ€™s not as if thereâ€™s a massive difference between Mr. Trumpâ€™s position on immigration and Mr. Cruzâ€™s position on immigration.? Mr. Trump might just be more provocative in terms of how he says it, but the actual positions arenâ€™t that different.â€?\nIn other words, those Republicans, theyâ€™re all a little crazy. This, of course, ignores the fact that Cruz and Rubio are aggressively attacking Trump as unqualified for the presidency, and Trump is hitting them back even harder.\nAnd hey,when Obama spoke of a GOP â€œcrackupâ€? and â€œcircus,â€? some Republicans and conservative commentators have used similar language in ripping Trumpâ€™s impact on the party. Itâ€™s hardly amazing that a Democrat would pile on.\nBut Obama also wandered into familiar territory: blaming the conservative media.\nHe said he regrets the â€œpolarizationâ€? and â€œnasty toneâ€? of politics, and that he does â€œsoul-searchingâ€? about how he can better unify the country.?\nBut the president also said?â€œobjectivelyâ€?--that â€œthe Republican political elites and many of the information outlets -- social media, news outlets, talk radio, television stations -- have been feeding the Republican base for the last seven years a notion that everything I do is to be opposed; that cooperation or compromise somehow is a betrayal; that maximalist, absolutist positions on issues are politically advantageous; that there is a â€˜themâ€™ out there and an â€˜us,â€™ and â€˜themâ€™ are the folks who are causing whatever problems youâ€™re experiencing.â€?\nWell, some conservatives have worked hard to block Obama, and the Republican Congress hasnâ€™t been very cooperative, with the Senate even ruling out action on a Supreme Court nominee before the president has picked anyone. But that is a two-way street, and Obama and the Democrats have also failed to find common ground.\nBut on the business about TV and radio and social media outlets: The president of the United States has the biggest megaphone of all. He can drown out any talk show host, blogger or tweeter. He often seems to use media criticism as a crutch to explain away his shortcomings and setbacks.\nAnd now he has a new target in the Republican front-runner who wants his job.\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

A tent was erected over the site of the service.\nThe sprawling, Spanish Mission-style library is located between the Reagan's post-White House home in the upscale Bel Air section of Los Angeles and Rancho del Cielo, the "ranch in the sky" where the Reagans spent their leisure time, sometimes on horseback, in the rugged mountains near Santa Barbara.\nThe guest list for the funeral tells a story about their lives, which stretched from Hollywood's Golden Age to the California statehouse during Reagan's time as governor to the Washington Beltway. Four of the five living first ladies and relatives of every president dating to John Kennedy were expected to attend.\nIt will bring together Democrat and Republican, an unusual tableau at a time of deep division in Washington and the 2016 campaign trail. Hillary Clinton plans to take a break from the presidential campaign to attend, and other politicians on the list cover the political spectrum, from Newt Gingrich to Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Reagan's two children, Patti Davis and Ronald Prescott Reagan, will be among the speakers at the funeral, which will include choirs and a Marine Corps band.\nJames A. Baker, who served in the Reagan administration, and former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw also will give remarks during the private ceremony officiated by the Rev. Stuart Kenworthy, vicar of Washington National Cathedral.\nOn Wednesday and Thursday at the library, lines of mourners and Reagan faithful filed slowly past the former first lady's closed casket, blanketed with white roses and peonies, Mrs. Reagan's favorite flower.\nTears often fell. The crowd, many in graying years, spoke to an era closed, a time of "morning again in America" and the Reagan doctrine intended to weaken Soviet influence during the Cold War.\nReagan left the presidency after eight years, on January 20, 1989.\n"Ronald Reagan was one of the best presidents we've ever had, and I admired them both as a couple for their love story and the support they showed to each other," said retired school teacher Mary Ellen Gruendyke, from Riverside.\nMrs. Reagan, who died Sunday at 94, planned the smallest details of her funeral. She selected the funeral's flower arrangements, the music to be played by a Marine Corps band and the list of guests invited to the private memorial.\nThe library site, where the 40th president was buried in 2004, provides sweeping views of horse country dotted with oaks and, on a clear day, a vista to the Pacific.\nThe Reagans "just fell in love" with the spot, Boston developer and Republican fundraiser Gerald Blakeley recalled in a 2004 interview. He was part of a partnership that donated the land where the library now sits.\n"We're just grateful for the Reagan years," Ray Brooks of Simi Valley said Thursday as he waited in line with his wife Jackie to board a shuttle to the library grounds, where Mrs. Reagan's casket was placed in the marble lobby with a bronze statue of a smiling Ronald Reagan nearby.\n"Everybody, no matter how they felt about those years, when they look back they remember them as good years because of the example they set. We need an example like that now," Brooks said.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Death to Americaâ€¦ and Snickers\nRIVALS GIVE TRUMP A PASS\nDonald Trump had his best debate so far, and he has Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio to thank for it.\nTrumpâ€™s campaign has been buffeted for weeks with unfavorable coverage about his business record , allegations of fraud , a lack of transparency and even claims of assault against a senior campaign staffer.\nGiven the tenor of the political discussion of late, one might have expected that the tone at Thursdayâ€™s CNN debate would have been an even more singeing version of what we heard a week prior in Detroit ? if only for the increase in combustible material.\nTrump must have been ready for the fight of his life against Cruz and Rubio, and clearly came to the stage with a more tentative air. As it turns out, he neednâ€™t have worried. Trump adopted a more presidential-sounding persona and did his best to revert to his early-debate strategy of staying out of the fray whenever possible and his rivals obliged him.\nIn a campaign that has become a referendum on Trumpâ€™s character, Cruz and Rubio didnâ€™t even raise the subject. And that was enough to put Trump in the driverâ€™s seat. Both raised issue-based critiques against Trump and tried to show him up on policy knowledge, but Trumpâ€™s supporters have never been demanding on that count.\nIn Rubioâ€™s case, it seems like he overlearned a lesson. The Florida senator was tut-tutted for making personal insults about Trump ? his spray tan, his small hands, etc. That, especially the joke about Trumpâ€™s junk, was too much.\nBut there is a difference between personal put downs and attacks on another candidateâ€™s character.\nTrump has managed to run a campaign intentionally short on policy details. He simply makes aspirational statements and then promises to â€œhire the best peopleâ€? or be a â€œgreat negotiatorâ€? to achieve the free border wall, Chinese capitulation on trade or even dealing with ISIS.\n(Trump seemed to stumble once in that regard Thursday when he backed the idea of 20,000 or 30,000 U.S. ground troops for the fight against ISIS.)\nThis election is not about issues. This election is about Trump. And certainly with only days to go before what may be the decisive batch of elections, itâ€™s certainly too late to try to put this contest on another path.\nTrumpâ€™s supporters want a charismatic, strong leader who will shake up the country. Who wouldnâ€™t? The question before the rest of the Republican Party is whether Trump is actually that person or if he is, as Rubio has previously charged, â€œa con man.â€?\nHis coloring and the size of his digits are not material to that discussion. But his record ? especially recent history like Trump University ? certainly is.\nThe absence of those attacks clearly surprised Trump who commented, â€œSo far, I cannot believe how civil itâ€™s been up here.â€? Thatâ€™s likely because Trump knew what he would have done as Cruz or Rubio: Go to your enemyâ€™s weakest spot and hit it mercilessly.\nTrump did it again and again throughout the cycle only to see his rivals start to learn the lesson. But on Thursday, they forgot what he had taught them.\nDispute deepens over Trump rally rough up - Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Ben Shapiro called on Trump to fire his campaign manager after Breitbart reporter and Fox News contributor, Michelle Fields, was reportedly assaulted at a Trump rally. Shapiro explained to Megyn Kelly on Thursdayâ€™s â€œThe Kelly File.â€?

LAT brings us the story: â€œVisitors to the valley called him the last of the mountain men, a local treasure. They admired his ability to live out his dream. After years of camping beneath these lofty trees with [Englishâ€™s son] Dennis and his wife Mary, he bid $11,000 for five acres here and won the deed. In the late 1970s, they proceeded to build a cabin that became a well-known waypoint for day-hikers and overnighters.

John Kasich in order to prevent Donald Trump from winning, according to published reports and comments from his own people.\n"If you want to stop Trump in Ohio, Kasich's the only guy who can beat him there," Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press.\nIn turn, Florida Sen. Rubio is hoping to win in his home state on Tuesday, thereby splitting the day's two big delegate prizes and keeping them out of Trump's hands.\nBut it doesnâ€™t look like Kasich is willing to play the same game. AP reporter Katie Ronayne Tweeted a quote from Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols saying in reference to the reported Rubio strategy, "We were going to win in OH without his help, just as he's going to lose in FL without ours"\nAccording to POLITICO , Rubio has denied any quid pro quo with Kasichâ€™s team. â€œI have not talked with John Kasich,â€? he said. He did seem to acknowledge to an MSNBC reporter on Friday, however, that Ohio may already be in the rear view mirror.\nâ€œThe reality at this stage is â€¦ we have a good team in Ohio, we will do as good as we can, but our focus is on Florida,â€? Rubio said.\nIn fact, the entire suggestion that the men could work together to thwart Trump seemed to have the opposite effect, with Kasichâ€™s people publicly relishing Rubio's seeming forfeiture of Ohio.\nâ€œWe welcome the support of the Rubio campaign,â€? Trent Duffy, another Kasich spokesman, told POLITICO, adding that any attempt to tell voters what to do was â€œpresumptuous.â€?\nâ€œThe voters should vote their conscience,â€? said Duffy. â€œThey should vote for the best person they think is best able to lead our country. We believe that man is John Kasichâ€¦everywhere across the country.â€?\nTed Cruz, who is running second in most polls, also scoffed at the alleged strategy. â€œItâ€™s real simple,â€? Cruz told reporters. â€œHow do you beat Donald Trump? You beat him.â€?\nPolls suggest that Kasich has a better chance in his home state than Rubio has in his. According to the RealClearPolitics poll average of the last 11 surveys in the state, Trump is besting the GOP field by 14.7 points in Florida. On the other hand, Trump is leading the pack by an average of only 2.5 percentage points in the last four Ohio polls.\nTrump continued to steal Rubioâ€™s hometown thunder Friday when he formally announced the endorsement of former presidential candidate -- and longtime Floridian -- Dr. Ben Carson.\nStanding at Trump's side in Palm Beach Friday morning, the retired neurosurgeon and conservative author gave Trump a hearty backing, and warned that a failure to rally behind him would "fracture the party in an irreparable way."\nRubio, who is coming in third in most polls, said it is Trump who could destroy the party, given the many Republicans who vow never to support him.\n"I certainly think it would fracture it," Rubio said of a Trump nomination on CBS' "This Morning.â€?\n"There is a very significant number of Republicans that will never vote for him.

His endorsement appears to serve as a counterweight to Carly Fiorina coming out for Ted Cruz earlier this week.\nAt the Miami debate Thursday night, Trump?summed up the reality, though, that Florida Sen. Rubio and Ohio Gov. Kasich face.\nHe said only â€œtwo of usâ€? can get the delegates to win ? meaning Trump and Cruz ? and â€œtwo of usâ€? cannot, referring to Rubio and Kasich.\nâ€œThat is not meant to be a criticism â€¦ thatâ€™s just a mathematical fact,â€? Trump said, urging the party to â€œbe smart and unify.â€? ?\nRubio and Kasich are vowing to win their home states, which dish out all their delegates to the primary night winner.\nDonald Trump Endorsements | InsideGov\nBut even if they win, their paths to the nomination remain unclear ? and their best angle may still be to try and deny Trump the delegates needed to clinch the nomination going into the convention in July.\nBut Trump strongly suggested that as early as next week, the GOP contest could winnow down to a two-man race.\nThe states holding primaries Tuesday are Ohio, Florida, Missouri, Illinois and North Carolina.\nThe CNN-hosted debate Thursday saw Rubio change up his campaign approach once again ? dialing back the personal attacks on Trump, which didnâ€™t do much for his numbers in the most recent round of contests.\nInstead, Rubio hit Trump?on more substantive issues.\nOne of the most pointed debate?clashes came over the diplomatic thaw with Cuba ??a huge issue in Florida, host of the CNN debate and next weekâ€™s critical primary. Trump tangled with his rivals as he claimed heâ€™s â€œin the middleâ€? on the issue.\nTrump said â€œsomethingâ€? should take place after a decades-long freeze, but, â€œI want to get a much better deal.â€?\nâ€œHereâ€™s a good deal,â€? Rubio snapped back. â€œCuba has free elections. Cuba stops putting people in jail.â€?\nHe ? along with his rivals ? did their best Thursday to draw distinctions between them and Trump.\nOftentimes, Trump seemed to lean on his â€œart of the dealâ€? to explain his approach to global challenges. But it earned him criticism from the others on stage.\nCruz hammered Trump for suggesting heâ€™d be able to re-negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran.\nâ€œI will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal,â€? Cruz countered.\nTrump also took heat from Rubio and others as he defended his claim that â€œIslam hates us.â€?\nThe Republican front-runner said thereâ€™s â€œtremendous hatredâ€? in the Muslim world and called for new laws to confront the threat. ?\nâ€œWe better expand our laws or weâ€™re being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us,â€? Trump said.?\nBut Rubio and Cruz both said â€œof courseâ€? they would not want to allow the targeting of family members of terror targets, as Trump has called for. And they chided him for his remarks.?\nâ€œThe answer is not scream all Muslims bad,â€? Cruz said.?\nâ€œThe problem is presidents canâ€™t just say whatever they want,â€? Rubio said. â€œIâ€™m not interested in being politically correct. â€¦ Iâ€™m interested in being correct.â€??\nTrumpâ€™s rivals noted America must work with other Muslim nations to confront the ISIS threat.\nFor the most part,?Trump and his three Republican presidential rivals held their personal fire Thursday night during their last debate before next Tuesday's primary in Florida ? which votes alongside four other states.\nTrump even remarked on the subdued tone: â€œSo far I cannot believe how civil itâ€™s been up here.â€?\n"I think it was good that we had a substantive debate," Cruz told Fox News' Megyn Kelly. "The last two debates were pretty ridiculous [and] I was glad to see that nonsense ending."\nOhio Gov. Kasich also stressed at the debate that heâ€™s run an â€œunwavering positive campaignâ€? all along.\nBut on the domestic front, they did battle on the best way to save Social Security -- with Trump breaking from his competition by saying he'd leave it alone despite warnings it would start?running out of money in two decades.\nâ€œI will do everything in my power not to touch Social Security,â€? Trump said. He said heâ€™d instead get rid of waste, fraud and abuse ??including by ensuring the government bids out contracts.?\nRubio, though, said, â€œYouâ€™re still going to have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that youâ€™re going to have to make up.â€? He called for gradually raising the retirement age to 70.\nCruz echoed that call, saying the program is â€œcareening toward insolvency.â€?\nâ€œWe need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security,â€? he said.?\nKasich also called for changes, though not necessarily to the retirement age.\nAs Trump consolidates support and builds his delegate lead, though, he?kicked off the debate with a pointed message to the so-called â€œRepublican establishment,â€? effectively telling them to get on board with his campaign.\nHe started his opening statement by claiming his campaign is bringing in Democrats, independents and others in huge numbers to the polls.\nâ€œThe Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace whatâ€™s happening,â€? he said, addressing tension between his campaign and senior GOP leaders. â€œWe are going to beat the Democrats.â€?\n?\n	foxnews	U.S.

"She reciprocated by secreting little notes in jellybeans in his suitcase.\nRelated Image\nExpand / Contract\nA portrait of Nancy Reagan at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. (Fox News)\n"Ronald and Nancy Reagan were defined by their love for each other," Baker added. "They were as close to being one person as it is possible for any two people to be."\nAlthough many speakers invoked the president's name, they were also quick to add that Mrs. Reagan was more than just a supportive wife. She was a force of nature herself.\n"There would be no Ronald Reagan Presidential Library without a President Ronald Reagan, and there likely wouldn't have been a President Ronald Reagan without a Nancy Reagan," said the couple's son, Ron Reagan.\nIt was her belief in what her husband could accomplish that gave his father the "chutzpah" to seek political office, he added.\nData curated by PrettyFamous\n"It would be a mistake, by the way, to consider her as somehow subordinate to him just because he was the one usually taking the center stage," Reagan said. "They were co-equals. They complemented one another."\nWhile her husband was affable, Mrs. Reagan could be loving, friendly and quick to laugh. But, if anyone did anything she thought was harmful to her husband, she was fiercely protective and sometimes quick to anger.\nFormer NBC anchor Tom Brokaw recalled that when he once questioned the hard-luck story of the president's early life, Mrs. Reagan was so angry that Reagan's own staff advised him to stay away from the White House until she calmed down. Reagan didn't mind the criticism, Brokaw said, but his wife did.\n"Occasionally I've thought that even God might not have the guts to argue with Nancy Reagan," the couple's daughter, Patti Davis, quipped.\nFor his part, Reagan spoke in public so warmly, and so often, about his wife, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney recalled, that he once told Reagan he was making every other world leader look bad in front of their wives.\n"Well, Brian," he said the president told him with a smile, "That's your problem."\nA waterproof tent was put up behind the library to shield its 1,000 invited guests from a rainy forecast. Although it sprinkled lightly during the 90-minute ceremony, the heavens didn't open up into a full downpour until its conclusion, forcing guests to open umbrellas as they left.\nAmong those in the front row were first lady Michelle Obama, who was seated next to former President George W. Bush. Hillary Clinton sat between Bush's wife, Laura, and former first lady Rosalynn Carter.\nThe sprawling, Spanish mission-style library is located between the Reagan's post-White House home in the upscale Bel Air section of Los Angeles and Rancho del Cielo, the "ranch in the sky" where the Reagans spent their leisure time, sometimes on horseback, in the rugged mountains near Santa Barbara.\nThe guest list for the funeral told the story of the couple's life together, which stretched from Hollywood's Golden Age to the California statehouse during Reagan's time as governor to Washington.\nMourners included former Reagan administration official Ed Meese, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Mike Love of the Beach Boys and singer Johnny Mathis.\nAs the group gathered briefly outside the library to chat, Mathis reminisced about how he and Mrs. Reagan would sing together during his visits to the Reagan family home. Their favorite song: "Our Love is Here to Stay."\nThe memorial service brought together Democrat and Republican, an unusual tableau at a time of deep division in Washington and on the 2016 campaign trail.\nOn Wednesday and Thursday at the library, more than 5,500 mourners filed slowly past the former first lady's closed casket, blanketed with white roses and peonies, Mrs. Reagan's favorite flower.\nTears often fell. The crowd, many in graying years, spoke to a time when it was "morning again in America" and the nation followed the Reagan doctrine to weaken Soviet influence during the Cold War.\nReagan left the presidency after eight years, on January 20, 1989.\n"Ronald Reagan was one of the best presidents we've ever had, and I admired them both as a couple for their love story and the support they showed to each other," said retired school teacher Mary Ellen Gruendyke, from Riverside.\nMrs. Reagan, who died Sunday at 94, planned the smallest details of her funeral. She selected the funeral's flower arrangements, the music to be played by a Marine Corps band and the list of guests invited to the private memorial.\nThe library site, where the 40th president was buried in 2004, provides sweeping views of horse country dotted with oaks and, on a clear day, a vista to the Pacific.\nThe Reagans "just fell in love" with the spot, Boston developer and Republican fundraiser Gerald Blakeley recalled in a 2004 interview. He was part of a partnership that donated the land where the library now sits.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

In Lebanon, the militant Hezbollah group's television station broadcast footage of the troops, advancing single file through a desert landscape as helicopter gunships provided cover.\nThe push was from the west and south of Palmyra and Syrian forces were also closing in on the ISIS-held town of Qaryatain in central Syria, Homs governor Talal Barazi said.\n"There is continuous progress by the army from all directions," he said, adding that he expected "positive results" over the next few days.\nIn the push on Palmyra, which started in earnest last week, Syrian government forces have been backed by intense Russian airstrikes.\nPalmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been in the hands of the Islamic State group since the extremists captured it last May. The seizure signified a major coup for ISIS, which emerged out of Al Qaeda to capture large swaths of Syria and neighboring Iraq in 2014.\nThe extremists cast themselves as Islamic warriors in an apocalyptic battle with Western civilizations, which they call "crusaders."\nIn Palmyra, ISIS destroyed many of the town's Roman-era relics, including the 2,000-year-old Temple of Bel and the iconic Arch of Triumph, and also killed dozens of captive Syrian soldiers and dissidents from ISIS in public slayings at the town's grand roman theater and other ruins.\nAlong with blowing up priceless archaeological treasures, among the first destructions ISIS carried out in Palmyra was the demolishing of the town's infamous Tadmur prison, where thousands of Syrian government opponents had been imprisoned and tortured over the years.\nThe advance on Palmyra comes against the backdrop of Syrian peace talks currently underway in Geneva between representative of the Damascus government and the Western-backed opposition. The talks have been boosted by a Russia-U.S.-brokered cease-fire that has mostly held since late February.\nThe Islamic State group and other militant factions, such as Syria's Al Qaeda branch known as the Nusra Front, are not part of the truce.\nOn Wednesday, Syria's U.N. ambassador and head of the government team, Bashar Jaafari, said he was handed a proposal by U.N. Special Envoy Staffan De Mistura.\nJaafari told reporters in Geneva that the government side would take the proposal back to Damascus and study it, and would respond during the next round of negotiations, tentatively scheduled for April.\nIt was not clear if this meant government negotiators were pulling out of the talks before they are officially to adjourn on Thursday.\nThe negotiations have been held up over the question of President Bashar Assad's role in any political transition to wind down the five-year conflict. The opposition has said Assad must step down as a precondition to any transition, while the government has refused to discuss Assad's departure.\nThe U.N. envoy said Tuesday the two parties had not yet discussed the matter of Assad's future.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

But senior U.S. military officials have said recently the Iraqi military doesn't have the strength to invade Mosul right now.\nHowever,?the Iraqi Air Force destroyed an ISIS missile plant in an air strike, killing?35 engineers and other experts working for the terror group, Iraqi media?outlets reported Thursday.\nTwelve Iraqi brigades, or some 36,000 troops, are needed to conquer Mosul and defeat ISIS according to U.S. officials. Currently, only a fraction of those forces have amassed in northern Iraq.\nOne staging area for an invasion force is in Makhmur, located 70 miles southeast of Mosul, an area held by Kurdish forces. A base outside of town is home to the 15th Iraqi Armored Division. It is supported by nearly 200 U.S. Marines and four powerful M777 155mm howitzer weapons, with an effective range between 15-25 miles depending on the ammunition, rounds that would fall well short of Mosul.\nThese U.S. Marine howitzers are supporting the Iraqi forces nearby.\nOn Saturday, a U.S. Marine was killed and three were seriously wounded when ISIS fired Katyusha rockets at the small U.S. base. It was attacked again two days later by a squad of ISIS fighters, two of whom were killed.\nThe base has not been attacked since, according to the U.S. official.\nThe Iraqi army at this time is conducting operations around Makhmur and is being supported by U.S. aircraft overhead, a U.S. official says. These operations stretch as far as?Qayyarah, an hour's drive from Mosul or 45 miles away, according to local reports.\nIn February 2015, the U.S. military said the Mosul operation would occur in the "April-May [2015] timeframe." The operation has been repeatedly delayed as Iraqi forces have focused their main efforts in Anbar Province in western Iraq.\nSenior U.S. military leaders including Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, the Defense Intelligence Agency chief, have expressed doubts to Congress in recent testimony about Mosul being liberated in 2016.?"I'm not as optimistic that we'll be able to turn that in?the near term, in my view, certainly not this year," Stewart?told the Senate Armed Services?Committee in February.\nLast weekend, a power Shiite cleric ordered demonstrations in Baghdad which led to the Iraqi military pulling more forces from the ISIS battlefield back to Iraq's capital to protect the government.\nLucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News Channel.

REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini  - RTSAOA4\nPope Francis will wash the feet of young refugees during an Easter Week ritual in a gesture high in symbolism inside the Catholic Church and beyond.\nThe Vatican didn't say Tuesday if non-Catholics would be among the 12 refugees participating in the Holy Thursday rite at an asylum center in Castelnuovo di Porto, north of Rome. But women will almost certainly be involved, and a Vatican official, Archbishop Rino Fisichella, noted that most of the center's residents are non-Catholic.\nThe ritual is meant to be a gesture of service, and re-enacts a rite Jesus performed on his apostles before being crucified.\nWithin weeks of becoming pope, Francis stunned conservatives by washing the feet of women, Orthodox Christians and Muslims at a juvenile detention facility. In subsequent years, he has washed the feet of other Muslims and even a Brazilian Catholic transsexual at Rome's main prison.\nVatican rules had long called for only men to participate, and popes past and many priests traditionally performed the ritual on 12 Catholic men, recalling Jesus' 12 apostles and further cementing the doctrine of an all-male priesthood.\nBut Francis in January changed the regulations to explicitly allow women and girls to participate.\nThe new norms said anyone from the "people of God" could be chosen. While the phrase "people of God" refers to baptized Christians, the decree also said that pastors should instruct "both the chosen faithful and others so that they may participate in the rite consciously, actively and fruitfully," suggesting that the rite could be open to non-Catholics as well.\nFisichella, who is spearheading Francis' Holy Year of Mercy initiative, said the choice of the refugee center was highly symbolic given the current migration crises.\n"He means to tell us that at this historic time, we must pay attention to the weakest and that we are called to restore their dignity without falling into subterfuge," Fisichella wrote in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano.\nThe fact that most of the residents aren't Catholic "is an even more eloquent" sign that respecting one another is the best path to peace, he wrote.\n"By washing the refugees' feet, Pope Francis is asking for respect for each one of them," he wrote.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

It offers 101 delegates in Saturdayâ€™s caucuses ? but Sanders will not only need to win, but win big to make any measurable difference in the race against Clinton.\nThe senator was buoyed, though, after walking away from the three contests earlier this week with more delegates than Clinton and chipping away, slightly, at Clintonâ€™s enormous lead. While the front-running former secretary of state won the marquee Arizona primary, Sanders gained a net of nearly 20 delegates by pocketing wins in the Idaho and Utah caucuses.\nSanders has tended to do better in caucus contests, and will compete in three more of them this weekend. Hawaii and Alaska, while less valuable in terms of delegates, also are holding caucuses on Saturday, alongside Washington.\nSanders, who has been barnstorming Western states, told a Spokane, Wash., crowd on Thursday that a win in Washington would mark a major step toward the White House for his campaign, as he maintained heâ€™s the best candidate to go up against the Republican nominee in November.?\nâ€œWe are the strongest candidate. â€¦ Weâ€™re going to work together to get the nomination,â€? Sanders told the crowd. â€œWe are gaining a lot of momentum. Just in the last week, we have closed the gap with Secretary Clinton.â€?\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nCounting the â€œDemocrats Abroadâ€? global primary earlier this week, Sanders said heâ€™s actually gained a net of roughly 25 delegates in recent days. Sanders returned to Washington Friday night for a Seattle rally, after a stop in Oregon earlier in the day.\nThe reality, though, is that Sanders would need a dramatic surge to catch up to Clinton or even hold her under the number needed to clinch the nomination.\nRight now, Clinton has a gaping, 1,690-946 delegate lead over Sanders, when â€œsuperdelegatesâ€? ? party insiders able to support whomever they want ? are included. Even among the so-called pledged delegates, bound to candidates by their states' elections, Clinton has 1,223 to Sandersâ€™ 920.\nIt takes 2,383 delegates to clinch the nomination.\n"The real problem is the math," said Geoffrey Skelley, a political analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, while noting Sanders does better in caucuses and is helped by â€œthe fact that his supporters are more energized.â€?\nDuring a Tuesday campaign stop in Everett, about 30 miles north of Seattle, Clinton noted she has gotten 2.6 million more votes than Sanders and more votes than anyone else, including Republican front-runner Donald Trump.\nMost of the state's Democratic leadership has endorsed Clinton, including Gov. Jay Inslee and Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell.\nBut Sanders has raised more in individual contributions from this state than any other presidential candidate.\nSeattle leads the way among large cities in per-capita individual contributions to Sanders, with about $145 for every 100 people, according to an analysis of federal campaign data. In terms of dollars, Seattle trails only New York and San Francisco in total individual contributions from cities, with $884,000 given through the end of February. That does not include individual contributions under $200, which makes up the majority of Sanders' support.\n"The senator has made clear that we're taking this all the way to the convention in July," said Sanders' Washington state director Dulce Saenz. "We have an uphill battle, absolutely. There's no denying the math, but the second half of the primary calendar is much more favorable to Bernie."\nTime will tell. After this weekendâ€™s contests, there is mostly a lull in the primary calendar until a round of delegate-heavy Eastern states vote in late April ? including New York, which Clinton represented in the Senate.\nFox Newsâ€™ Lauren Blanchard and The Associated Press contributed to this report.?\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

374031	http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/25/ted-cruz-earns-grudging-media-respect-but-is-it-too-late.html	Ted Cruz earning grudging media respect, but is it too late?	2016-03-26 00:00:00	Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print\n?\nTed Cruz is suddenly having a moment. The question is whether that moment comes too late for him to beat Donald Trump.\nCruz never managed to capitalize on winning the Iowa caucuses, which led to a streak in which Trump captured 20 states and a seemingly insurmountable lead in delegates. But now that every other candidate other than John Kasich has bit the dust, the Texas senator has emerged as the anti-Trump alternative?even among those who donâ€™t much like him.\nAnd that has produced more positive coverage?or at least more respectful coverage?from a press corps that Cruz once told me is overwhelmingly comprised of partisan Democrats. And Cruz now says the media want Trump to win because, in their ideological fervor, they think heâ€™d be the weakest candidate against Hillary Clinton.\nWhether thatâ€™s a fantasy or not, the Cruz team believes that the senatorâ€™s specifics on policy are finally helping him against what they view as Trumpâ€™s reality-show candidacy. They believe his superior ground game will help them in future contests (though most of the caucus states have already voted). And raising $72 million so far hasnâ€™t hurt.\nThe strategists recognize that the â€œWashington cartelâ€? that Cruz has been running against is embracing him with hold-your-nose enthusiasm. And they are acutely aware that Cruz is highly unlikely to reach the magic number of 1,237, since heâ€™d have to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates.\nBut one adviser said Cruz does best against Trump in closed primary states?those that exclude Democrats and independents?and that the convention is â€œlike a closed primary on steroids.â€?\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nThe pundits are taking note as the remnants of the GOP establishment, along with the conservative media establishment, reluctantly coalesce around Cruz.\nThus we have the strange specter of Jeb Bush, whose moderate record in Florida resembles that of Kasich, endorsing Cruz. The same goes for Mitt Romney, who governed Massachusetts in Kasich-like fashion (remember Romneycare?) but is now with Cruz. Carly Fiorina is also on board. As is Lindsey Graham, who once said no one would be convicted for killing Cruz on the Senate floor.\nIn the media world, the anti-Trump National Review, and conservative radio host Mark Levin, are backing Cruz.\nThe latest Fox News poll has Trump leading Cruz by just 41 to 38 percent (with Kasich trailing at 17). Thatâ€™s substantial progress for Cruz, with one giant caveat: National polls donâ€™t mean that much in a state-by-state battle for delegates.\nBut an Emerson poll has Cruz leading Trump 36 to 35 percent, a statistical tie, in Wisconsin, the next big state on the calendar. And Scott Walker, another presidential dropout, has made it pretty clear that he plans to endorse Cruz.\nAnother Cruz talking point is that he leads Hillary by 3 points in that Fox poll, while Trump trails by 11 points. (Kasich, who has brushed aside Cruzâ€™s calls to quit, actually has the strongest showing, beating Clinton by 11.) But these early hypothetical matchups mean little before the campaign is actually waged.\nCruz is making a major issue of the dustup with Trump over their wives. (The Donald threatened to â€œspill the beansâ€? on Heidi Cruz in reaction to that nude GQ photo of Melania Trump posted by an anti-Trump PAC that has no connection to the Cruz campaign.) He looked into the camera yesterday and angrily declared, â€œDonald, youâ€™re a sniveling coward,â€? insisting that he â€œleave my wife alone.â€?\nThat issue has already gotten its 15 minutes of fame, and what matters is putting points on the board. The senatorâ€™s momentum could dissipate if Trump clobbers him in such upcoming states as New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland, not to mention the June 7 contests in California and New Jersey. If Trump goes to Cleveland with anything close to 1,237 delegates, it will be hard to deny him.\nCruz, at his core, is a hard-edged conservative, while Trump has a more mixed ideology that he brands common-sense conservatism. The irony is that Cruz is now getting some late-inning help from people who never imagined being in his camp?or that Trump would be closing in on their nomination.\n?\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Bernie Sanders is looking for big wins Saturday in Alaska, Hawaii and Washingtonâ€™s caucuses, trying to cut into front-runner Hillary Clintonâ€™s sizable lead and kick-off a Western swing that he can ride to the July nominating convention.\nThe biggest prize will be Washington, in which 101 delegates are up for grabs.\nThe Vermont senator and democratic socialist is expected to do well in Washington, considering residents of Seattle, the biggest city in the Pacific Northwest and among the most the liberal in the country, are huge Sanders campaign contributor.\nThe city has also passed a $15 minimum wage, like the one Sanders wants at the federal level. And on Friday night, he drew at least 10,000 people to a rally at the Safeco Field.\nâ€œDonâ€™t let anybody tell you Hillary Clinton is the strongest candidate to take on the Republicans,â€? he told the crowd. â€œIt is just not true.â€?\nSanders hopes a win in Washington along with ones in Alaska and Hawaii, which offer 16 and 25 delegates respectively, will ignite his campaign after a rough trip across the South, and lead to wins in Oregon and California, which offers 546 delegates.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nGoing into Saturday, Clinton had a 1,223-to-920 lead on Sanders in so-called pledged delegates, who are bound to candidates by their states' elections.\nIt takes 2,383 delegates to clinch the nomination.\nTop Sanders adviser Ted Devine earlier this week expressed optimism about the campaign and told FoxNews.com that he expects Clintonâ€™s lead to be under 300 delegates by this weekend â€œwith a couple of thousands more delegates to go.â€?\nMost of the Washingtonâ€™s Democratic leadership has endorsed Clinton, including Gov. Jay Inslee and Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray.\nStill, Sanders enters Saturday optimistic after winning more delegate in three contests earlier this week. He gained a net of nearly 20 delegates with wins in the Idaho and Utah caucuses, despite losing the marquee Arizona primary to Clinton.\nSanders has done slightly better in caucus contests, winning seven of them compared to five primaries.\nHe has also raised more in individual contributions from Washington than any other presidential candidate.\nSeattle leads the way among large cities in per-capita individual contributions to Sanders, with about $145 for every 100 people, according to an analysis of federal campaign data. In terms of dollars, Seattle trails only New York and San Francisco in total individual contributions from cities, with $884,000 given through the end of February. That does not include individual contributions under $200, which makes up the majority of Sanders' support.\nDespite the optimism and fundraising numbers, Sanders would still need a dramatic surge to catch up to Clinton or even hold her under the number needed to clinch the nomination.\n"The real problem is the math," said Geoffrey Skelley, a political analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, while noting Sanders does better in caucuses and is helped by â€œthe fact that his supporters are more energized.â€?\nDuring a Tuesday campaign stop in Everett, about 30 miles north of Seattle, Clinton noted she has gotten 2.6 million more votes than Sanders and more votes than anyone else, including Republican front-runner Donald Trump.\n"The senator has made clear that we're taking this all the way to the convention in July," said Sanders' Washington state director Dulce Saenz. "We have an uphill battle, absolutely. There's no denying the math, but the second half of the primary calendar is much more favorable to Bernie."\nAfter this weekendâ€™s contests, there is mostly a lull in the primary calendar until a round of delegate-heavy Eastern states vote in late April -- including New York, which Clinton represented in the Senate.\nFox Newsâ€™ Lauren Blanchard and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n?\n	foxnews	U.S.

(SANA via AP)\nSyrian troops recaptured the ancient town of Palmyra from the Islamic State, state media and activists said Sunday.\nâ€œAfter heavy fighting during the night, the army is in full control of Palmyra ? both the ancient site and the residential neighborhoods,â€? a military source told Sky News.\nPalmyraâ€™s recapture would mark one of the biggest reversals for ISIS since Russiaâ€™s intervention in the five-year conflict.\nState media reported Saturday that government forces seized three neighborhoods inside Palmyra. Syrian troops and allied militiamen backed by Russian airstrikes took up positions in three neighborhoods that are part of the modern town, according to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\nPalmyra, affectionately known as the "bride of the desert," used to attract tens of thousands of tourists every year. ISIS drove out government forces in a matter of days and later demolished some of the best-known monuments in the UNESCO world heritage site. The extremists believe ancient ruins promote idolatry.\nRetaking the town would be a major victory for President Bashar Assad's government and its allies, which have made steady gains in recent months against IS and other insurgents, including Western-backed rebels.\nThe battle for Palmyra, now entering its fourth week according to the Observatory, has not been easy. Government forces lost at least 18 soldiers on Friday alone, including a major general, the Observatory and ISIS-affiliated media sites reported. Another 10 soldiers were killed Saturday.\nFootage broadcast on Lebanese stations aligned with the Syrian government showed smoke rising over Palmyra's skyline, as tanks and helicopters fired at positions inside the town. ISIS began evacuating civilians this week to other parts of its territories in Syria.\nNo civilians remain in the town, a Palmyra resident who left earlier this week told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity out of safety concerns.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n	foxnews	World

And so far he's only winning 37 percent.\nThere were 162 delegates at stake Saturday -- Washington with 101, followed by Hawaii with 25 and Alaska with 16.\nThe Vermont senator won 55 delegates, compared to 20 for Clinton. However, more will likely to be allocated to Sanders in several weeks, when the Washington state Democratic Party releases vote shares by district.\nBut Clinton still maintains a wide advantage in delegates, winning 1,243 to Sanders' 975 based on primary and caucuses to date.\nHer lead is even bigger when including super-delegates, or party officials who can back any candidate they wish.

Ted Cruz as unqualified to deal with complicated international threats.\nHer campaign sees the April 19 contest in New York as an important one, not just because of the rich delegate prize but because losing to Sanders in a state she represented in the Senate would be a psychological blow.\nShe hopes to lock up an even larger share of delegates in five Northeastern contests a week later.\nFox Newsâ€™ Lauren Blanchard and Joseph Weber and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n?\n	foxnews	U.S.

Moran's comments on court nominee stir up conservatives	2016-03-28 00:00:00	GOP Sen. Moran's comments on court nominee stir up conservatives\nPublished             March 26, 2016\nFacebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print\n?\nA Republican senator's remarks expressing support for Senate consideration of President Barack Obama's Supreme Court pick have angered conservatives and underscored the passion the issue stirs in GOP and Democratic activists.\nThe comments by Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran put him at odds with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other GOP leaders, who have said the chamber won't hold hearings or a vote on the nominee. Only a handful of Senate Republicans have diverged from that stance.\nMoran's statements prompted a leader of one conservative group to warn that her organization was preparing an advertising campaign "to remind Senator Moran that he represents the people of Kansas and neither President Obama nor the Democratic Party." Others didn't rule out that the comments might prompt a conservative to challenge Moran in the state's GOP primary.\nObama nominated federal judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court vacancy on March 16.\nThe fuss over Moran's comments came as the White House announced that Garland will have his first courtesy meeting next week with a Republican senator, Mark Kirk of Illinois.\nKirk faces a difficult re-election in November in Democratic-leaning Illinois. Until Moran's remarks, Kirk was the only GOP senator to call for a Senate vote on Obama's pick and one of two -- with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine -- to favor Senate Judiciary Committee hearings.\nMoran, former head of the Senate GOP's campaign organization, faces re-election this fall in a deeply conservative state that has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since the 1930s. While he is so far unopposed in the Aug. 2 Republican Senate primary, the filing deadline for candidates who might run against him is not until June 1.\nAccording to the Dodge City Daily Globe, Moran said Monday at the Dodge City Rotary Club, "I think we have the responsibility to have a hearing, to have the conversation and to make a determination on the merit."\nThe Garden City Telegram reported that on the same day, Moran told a small gathering in Cimarron, Kansas, that there should be a hearing and said, "I would rather have you (constituents) complaining to me that I voted wrong on nominating somebody than saying I'm not doing my job."\nMoran said it was extremely unlikely he'd back the nominee and expressed doubt that McConnell would let the Senate process proceed, according to both reports.\nA Moran spokeswoman said Friday that the lawmaker was not reachable for comment, but released a written statement in which he did not retreat from his earlier remarks.\n"I believe I have a duty to ask tough questions and demand answers. I am certain a thorough investigation would expose Judge Garland's record and judicial philosophy, and disqualify him in the eyes of Kansans and Americans," Moran said.\nCarrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, said "caving into" Obama was not serving Kansans and said her group was preparing a "robust" television and digital ad campaign aimed at Moran.\nDavid Christensen, lobbying for the anti-abortion Family Research Council, said Moran had earned a perfect score in the group's rating of lawmakers' votes last year and said, "Now we have this extremely important Supreme Court debate, and now is not the time for him to go wobbly."\nAsked if the episode might encourage a conservative challenge to Moran, Christensen said, "I think this definitely raises concerns among conservatives." Asked the same question, spokesman Dan Holler of Heritage Action for America said, "This is certainly a point of frustration."\nDr. Milton Wolf, whose tea party-backed campaign nearly captured the GOP nomination in 2014 from long-time incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts, tweeted this week, "How much of a coward is (at)JerryMoran?"\nMcConnell spokesman Donald Stewart declined to comment on Moran's remarks.\nThe White House said Garland, who met with five Democratic senators last week, will meet with Kirk on Tuesday. He will also meet with four additional Democrats next week, the White House said.\nIn Las Vegas, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., predicted the Senate will confirm Garland after Democrat Hillary Clinton is elected president in November.\nReid chided McConnell's strategy of opposing Senate consideration of the nominee this year, saying he couldn't comprehend what senator would follow that "dumb advice."\nHe said once Democrats win the presidential election, Republicans would choose to confirm the moderate Garland over a Clinton nominee, who might be more liberal. McConnell has said the Senate will not consider Garland during a post-election lame duck session.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Other big, upcoming primaries include Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York, Clintonâ€™s home state.\nSanders is popular among younger and more progressive Americans but continues to struggle to connect with Hispanic and African-American voters.\nHe was expected to do well in Washington, considering residents of Seattle, the biggest city in the Pacific Northwest, are among the most liberal in the country and major campaign contributors.\nHe drew more than 10,000 supporters at an outdoor rally Friday evening in Seattle. And the state appeared to have a record voter turnout, similar to others that have helped keep alive Sandersâ€™ insurgent campaign.\nMost of Washingtonâ€™s Democratic leadership endorsed Clinton, including Gov. Jay Inslee, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell.\nStill, Sanders entered Saturdayâ€™s contests optimistic after winning more delegate than Clinton in three contests earlier last week -- nearly 20 in the Idaho and Utah caucuses, despite losing the marquee Arizona primary to the former secretary of state.\nSanders has done significantly better in caucus contests, now winning 10 of the last 12.\nMost of his 15 primary-season wins have been in states with largely white populations and in the caucus contests, which tend to attract the most active liberal Democrats.\nWhile Sanders faces a steep climb to the nomination, Clintonâ€™s recent losses highlight her persistent vulnerabilities, including concerns about her trustworthiness and weak support among younger voters.\nClinton has been looking past the primary contests and aiming at potential Republican challengers.\nShe did not hold a public event after the Saturdayâ€™s results were announced.\nBut in interviews, rallies and speeches last week, she largely focused on Tuesday's deadly attacks in Brussels, casting GOP front-runner Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as unqualified to deal with complicated international threats.\nHer campaign sees the April 19 contest in New York as an important one, not just because of the rich delegate prize but because losing to Sanders in a state she represented in the Senate would be a psychological blow.\nShe hopes to lock up an even larger share of delegates in five Northeastern contests a week later.\nFox Newsâ€™ Lauren Blanchard and Joseph Weber and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n?\n	foxnews	U.S.

A year after â€˜wiped cleanâ€™ Hillaryâ€™s email still a mess\n? Power Play: Testing Trumpâ€™s inevitability\n? Trump dispatches Carson to North Dakota\n? Ryanâ€™s conundrum\n? Meanwhile, back at the mall?\nA YEAR AFTER â€˜WIPED CLEANâ€™ HILLARYâ€™S EMAIL STILL A MESS\nA year ago this morning , Americaâ€™s political class woke up to a new round of declarative-sounding claims from the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\nIn an emergency press conference earlier that month to answer revelations about her use of a â€œhomebrewâ€? email server as secretary of state, Clinton had already been clear that she had no classified information in the emails, that all the work-related emails had been turned over and that the server would â€œremain private.â€?\nBut some in the press remained unsatisfied and wondered whether there werenâ€™t other shoes to drop.\nSo her lawyer, David Kendall, put a finer point on those claims a couple of weeks later in a letter telling House investigators that they couldnâ€™t get to any more emails, even with a subpoena, because there were no emails from Clintonâ€™s â€œtenure as secretary of state on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized.â€?\nYes, folks, on this day in 2015, many Americans heard for the first time the words of Rep. Trey Gowdy, who said that Team Clinton claimed the server had been â€œwiped clean.â€?\nIn his letter, Kendall went on to declare that this whole email thing was absolutely, positively no big deal ? â€œnot an â€˜arrangementâ€™ that is â€˜unprecedentedâ€™ or â€˜unique,â€™ but instead the normal procedure carried out by tens of thousands of agency officials and employees in the ordinary course.â€?\nMany Democrats quickly rallied to their frontrunnerâ€™s cause and declared further inquests by House Republicans pointless political grandstanding. That was another way of saying that this was all very normal and fine and superâ€¦ but even if wasnâ€™t youâ€™ll never prove it, copper.\nConsider that backdrop and now consider this headline in your Twitter feed today: â€œClinton email probe enters new phase as FBI interviews loom.â€? Or this one : â€œHow Clintonâ€™s email scandal took rootâ€?\nA year later we accept as relatively uncontroversial that the server did not, in fact, â€œremain privateâ€? (hence the FBIâ€™s play in the game). We know that there were scads of classified material on the server. We know that her practices were truly unprecedented and absolutely unique.\nIt is up to partisans or media critics or sociologists to make claims about what that slipping sidewinder of a trajectory for the truth says about Clinton, the press and our relative tolerance for dishonesty.\nBut as it relates to the winning and losing of elections, ask yourself if Clinton would be having so much trouble with Sen. Bernie Sanders in March of 2016 if she had handled March of 2015 better?\nYes, there is much to explain the fact that Sanders is faring better against Clinton than Clinton fared against eventual nominee Barack Obama eight years ago ? populism, hipsterism, anti-corporatism and even avianism .\nThere is also the fact that Democrats are so delighted by what they see as the self-immolation of the GOP that they cannot be bothered with too much pragmatism. If you feel certain that the other team canâ€™t win the game, how hard are you going to get after it in practice?\n(This has been something of a ratcheting effect since Republicans undertook their current fratricidal slaughter believing that Clinton was unelectable and might even be in prison before Election Day.)\nBut just remember that in the year since we learned about â€œwiped clean,â€? Democratic primary voters have been the main victims of Clintonâ€™s shifting stories. The subtext of her claim to her party was that she had done nothing wrongâ€¦ and that she had taken every step necessary to thwart investigators even if she had. She was, she assured her party, a safe bet.\nAs it turns out she had neither done right in her electronic hygiene nor been thorough in preventing the discovery of her bad practices. She proved neither forthright nor expert at the kind of tactical blocking for which she and her husband were famed.\nClinton still looks likely to clinch the nomination with much, much less agony than her GOP counterpart and, barring more shocking revelations, has a superhighway-width path back to the White House.\nBut what she doesnâ€™t have is a smooth path to her partyâ€™s nomination and that is substantially the fault of her botched response to the email scandal of her own making.\n[Dem delegate count: Clinton 1,712; Sanders 1,004 (2,383 needed to win)]\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEEâ€¦\nIn the longstanding baseball battle of the jocks versus the nerds, the past decade has been all about the nerds. The â€œMoneyballâ€? approach to analytics combined with new technologies for measuring and tracking player performance have allowed the statistically obsessive to see the Big League game as an algorithm rather than an organism. And that approach has tended to minimize the role of managers in the dugout. In some organizations, the revered â€œskippersâ€? of yore have been reduced to functionaries implementing the spreadsheet orders of the nerds in charge. But, with less than a week until Opening Day 2016, some teams are rethinking the approach. Author Steve Kettmann checked in on one such team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and its rookie manager, Dave Roberts, who has a very old-school approach to making better baseball players: Help them to become â€œbetter men.â€?\nGot?a?TIP?from the?RIGHT?or the?LEFT?

Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said on a conference call Monday, noting the Vermont senator was born there -- though Clinton represented the delegate-rich state in the Senate.\nThe campaign escalated its battle for New York over the weekend, renewing calls for a debate in the Empire State. On Monday, Weaver said the campaign was â€œdisappointedâ€? Clintonâ€™s team has yet to agree.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nMeanwhile, Weaver claimed grassroots fundraising has collected another $4 million since Saturdayâ€™s caucus victories which he said would â€œgive us the resources to compete in Wisconsin.â€?\nSanders, despite his success over the weekend in Washington state and other contests, nevertheless faces the same reality he did a week earlier. Clinton maintains a comfortable lead in pledged delegates. And when superdelegates, or party insiders who can back whomever they want, are factored in, the former secretary of state is pulling within sight of clinching the nomination.\nSpeaking with The Washington Post, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said they â€œintend to win this thing with a majority of pledged delegatesâ€? and -- amid signs that the Sanders campaign may crank up its attacks -- said the senator will have to decide â€œwhat kind of campaign he wants to run.â€?\nThe latest delegate count shows Clinton with a grand total of 1,712 and Sanders with 1,004.\nIn terms of pledged delegates only, Clinton has 1,243 to Sandersâ€™ 975. It takes 2,383 to clinch the nomination.\nSandersâ€™ best shot may be to close the pledged delegate gap just enough to try to persuade superdelegates to switch allegiances ? a strategy he hinted at Sunday.\nSpeaking with CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Union,â€? Sanders claimed â€œthe momentum is with usâ€? and â€œa lot of these superdelegates may rethink their position with Hillary Clinton.â€?\nSanders senior strategist Tad Devine said Monday that there is ongoing communication with superdelegates, though he wouldnâ€™t give names. He claimed â€œdozensâ€? have committed to Sanders but have yet to go public.\nSanders still would need an incredible surge to get to that point. He notched three convincing, double-digit victories on Saturday in Washington state, Hawaii and Alaska. The wins helped him close the delegate gap by at least three dozen, with more delegates from the states still to be allocated.\nBut continuing the momentum in Wisconsin and then New York would be critical to have a shot in the next big round of contests in late April, when several Eastern states will be voting.\nHis campaign got a dose of positive news Monday regarding the June 7 primary in California.\nA USC Dornsife/LA Times poll showed Clinton leading Sanders 45-37 percent ? representing a much tighter race than it was last September, when Clinton led 42-26 percent.\nThe poll of 1,500 voters was conducted March 16-23, and had a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points.\nOn Monday, Devine said despite the campaignâ€™s losses in a streak of contests earlier this month, â€œWe expect to compete in every single state to the end.â€?\nFoxNews.comâ€™s Joseph Weber contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

383970	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/03/28/shocking-truth-about-how-swiftly-and-effectively-isis-has-spread-jihad-across-globe.html	The shocking truth about how swiftly and effectively ISIS has spread jihad across the globe	2016-03-31 00:00:00	Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print\n?\nPeople might sense that Islamist terror is on the rise as they follow daily news reporting, but they might be shocked at how significantly it has spiraled in lethality and focus in a very short amount of time.\nDeaths from jihadist assaults rose from an annual average of roughly 2,500 innocents per year from 2001 to 2006, to an average of 3,300 per year in 2007-2011, to 9,000 per year in 2012-2013 and to an average of more than 28,000 in 2014-2015.\nAlso, terrorist attacks were once limited to a few countries with no real nexus in the period from 2001 to 2006, suggesting that jihadists were striking targets of opportunity without much coordination or broader strategy.\nToday ISIS claims two caliphates ? one the size of Indiana in Iraq and Syria and the other along the Mediterranean coast in Libya ? from which to expand its genocidal influence in the Middle East and Africa. Large areas of the African continent have also experienced tremendous mass slaughter from Islamist terror in recent years, led by ISIS affiliate Boko Haram.\nThe Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT) ? in a new analysis of global Islamist terror ? identified these two alarming developments that have gone largely unreported and unnoticed.\nThe analysis confirms that the West has proven itself unable to develop and implement effective strategies to confront, contain and defeat ISIS or any of the 34 terrorist organizations that have pledged their allegiance to it.\nThe result is that deaths attributable to jihadists have increased by roughly 700 percent since 2011, and ISIS now has two caliphates (Iraq/Syria and Libya) from which it can threaten three continents: Asia, Africa and Europe.\nIt is a dangerous situation.\nThe causes are even more frightening. The neighborhoods where the West has most actively been engaged ? Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya and Syria ? are failed states.?\nEgypt, another country in which the West involved itself, nearly became a terrorist haven with a government dominated by the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood before the military overthrew it. Even so, it is still attempting to reclaim authority over parts of the Sinai Peninsula from terrorists.\nIraq, Yemen, Libya, and Syria each reflected some semblance of statehood by maintaining stability and suppressing violent elements within their borders prior to Western intervention. Afghanistan never had a strong functional administration, and Egypt is slowly reestablishing control over internal areas.\nThe West has demonstrated an ability to remove regimes relatively easily, but it has been unable to transition these countries toward stable governments that can maintain order and stability within their own borders.\nCountries where the West has intervened in domestic affairs now feature three distinctions. They account for more than 55 percent of the total global casualties resulting from jihadist terror. They represent the core of the ISIS caliphates expanding their deadly activities into the rest of the Middle East, Africa and Europe. They are creating millions of refugees and untold suffering in the world today.\nAdditionally, with the notable exception of Algeria, Africa barely registered on the map of significant Islamist terror activity in 2001. Today, half of the?18?countries with the highest level of fatalities on the globe are located there.\nThe course of affairs will unfortunately continue to move in the wrong direction because Western leaders appear incapable of doing anything meaningful about it.\nToday Iran directs Iraqâ€™s military . Saudi Arabia and Iran are fighting a proxy war in Yemen. The U.S. has returned to Libya to conduct air strikes with fighter jets and drones against ISIS. Peace talks in Syria fall apart nearly daily.\nWestern military and security services discuss their progress against either of the caliphates, but they do not appear willing to commit the short-term resources necessary to completely eradicate them.\nThey need to recognize the magnitude of the defeat that it is facing and develop bipartisan solutions that will diminish and eliminate the swelling threat.\nHalf-hearted measures are not the answer.\nRepublican Pete Hoekstra is the Shillman senior fellow at the Investigative Project on Terrorism and the former chairman (R-Michigan) of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee.

The paper then went on to report that â€œPakistani officials were skeptical about the claim, as most of those killed and wounded were Muslims. But because Sunday was Easter, a large number of Christian families had come to the park.â€?\nIn majority Muslim Pakistan, a country where anti-Christian sentiment is a numbing fact of daily life, no one should be surprised that the Pakistani government would seek to downplay the targeted Easter mass murder of Christians in the Punjab.\nWhat was shocking, however, was that the initial statement by National Security Council Spokesperson Ned Price failed to mention that the terrorist group taking "credit" for the carnage was targeting Christians. Hereâ€™s his statement:\nâ€œThe United States condemns in the strongest terms todayâ€™s appalling terrorist attack in Lahore, Pakistan. This?cowardly act in what has long been a scenic and placid park has killed dozens of innocent civilians and left scores?injured. We send our deepest condolences to the loved ones of those killed, just as our thoughts and prayers are?with the many injured in the explosion. The United States stands with the people and Government of Pakistan at this?difficult hour. We will continue to work with our partners in Pakistan and across the region, as together we will be?unyielding in our efforts to root out the scourge of terrorism,â€?\nTwenty-four hours later White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest did acknowledge that Christians were targeted in Pakistan on Easter though he was quick to add that the majority of the victims were Muslim.\nThe fact is that the Obama administrationâ€™s legacy when it comes to terror attacks has been to avoid highlighting or even acknowledging the Islamist theology of hate that is a common denominator and motivator of unspeakable crimes against humanity launched by ISIS, Al Qaeda, Al Shabab and Boko Haram in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and yes, the United States.\nTragically, the initial failure by the U.S. to acknowledge that the suicide bomber who blew himself up among the swings and sliding ponds was looking to murder and maim?Christian families, is not surprising.\nWhile public opinion long ago connected the dots of Islamist anti-Christian propaganda to their genocidal actions in Syria and Iraq, it took a congressional resolution to finally force Secretary of State John Kerry to recently admit that yes, Christians and Yazidis were victims of an attempted genocide. And, for decades, Europeâ€™s elite had their eyes wide shut to the hate burgeoning Islamist networks in their own cities and are only now playing a deadly game of catch up.\nThe disgraceful NSC statement on Sunday wouldnâ€™t have made any difference to the terrorists, so at this late stage in the Obama administration, what difference does it make how the latest atrocity is characterized by Washington?\nFor one thing, an emphatic and empathetic statement from the White House would have sent a message of solidarity to the beleaguered Christians of our sometime ally Pakistan.?\nSecondly, Lahore was not the first, only the latest site for Islamist fanatics targeting religious minorities, and not just Christians.\nSky News is now reporting that ISIS militants recently arrested in Turkey revealed their (active) plans to attack Jewish kindergartens in that country and to attack (again) Istanbulâ€™s Great Synagogue.\nEmbedded in the DNA of the Islamist fanatics is a theologically fueled and validated hate for the?â€œKafirâ€? (a person who is not Muslim).\nThere are countless plots?in the terror pipeline,?on every continent targeting Muslims and non-Muslims alike who dare to stand up to the fanatics.\nBut just how do we go about killing the message along with the genocidal messengers without attacking the cancerous DNA?\nDoes anyone other than the President?Obama believe?anymore that refusing to call out Islamist terrorism for what it is will somehow empower and win the day for truly peaceful and moderate Muslims?\nHere we are now, caught in a trap of our own making. The price of our failure to deal with genocidal hate head-on recalls a dire warning from an ancient Jewish Midrash that teaches: â€œWhoever shows mercy to the cruel, will in the end be cruel to the Merciful.â€?\nG-d help us all.\nRabbi Abraham Cooper is associate Dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.

Peril, Muslims Try to Get Out Vote ,â€? Alan Rappeport wrote about how three Muslim groups and organizations in the United States are organizing to elect Democratic candidates this fall because of perceived hostility toward American Muslims by Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.?\nRappeport indicated these Muslim organizations especially object to Senator Cruzâ€™s call to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods.\nGiven the strong liberal bias of the New York Times, it was not a surprise when this article failed to mention that the alleged â€œIslamophobicâ€? statements by Senator Cruz and Mr. Trump were in fact criticisms of radical Islam and President Obamaâ€™s refusal to name or confront this threat.\nIt was surprising that all of the Muslim groups cited by Rappeport have ties to radical Islam that he failed to mention.\nThe most stunning example of this is the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Virginia which Rappeport says has been holding voter education workshops to convince its members to vote against Republican presidential candidates.?\nRappeport neglected to mention the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Centerâ€™s notorious past.? Anwar al-Awlaki, a key official with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011, was Imam at this mosque between January 2001 and April 2002.? Two of the 9/11 hijackers worshipped there.? There also have been reports of violent materials found in this mosque.\nThe Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center may be the best possible example proving the need for Senator Cruzâ€™s call to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods.\nRappaport also omitted the Islamist radicalism of other American Muslim groups cited in his article he says are encouraging mosques to turn themselves into voter registration centers.\nOne is the Council on American?Islamic Relations (CAIR) which claims to be â€œAmerica's largest Muslim civil rights organization.â€? However, its record shows this is far from the case.\nCAIR was named in 2007 as a co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation case -- the largest terrorist financing case in U.S. history.?\nTwo days after the Dec. 2, 2015 terrorist shooting in San Bernardino, Hussam Ayloush, the executive director of CAIRâ€™s Los Angeles chapter, tried to blame U.S. policy for this deadly attack when he told CNNâ€™s â€œNew Day,â€? â€œsome of our own foreign policy, as Americans, as the West have fueled that extremism . . . We are partly responsible.â€?\nIn July 2014, while Hamas was firing rockets at Israel from Gaza, attendees at a CAIR-Florida-organized protest praised the Hamas attacks at a rally in Miami by chanting, â€œWe are Hamas!â€? â€œWe are Jihad!â€?\nTwo other Muslim American Group cited by Rappaport, The Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA) and the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO), also have radical Islamist ties that he did not mention.?\nICNA preaches a global caliphate and Islamic shariah law over America to its members and reportedly has an â€œultimate goal of the establishment of Islam as the sole basis of global society and governanceâ€? according to the Investigative Project on Terrorism .? ICNA also was named as a co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation case.\nThe USCMO is an umbrella organization of American Muslim groups.? CAIR and ICNA are two of its founding members.? Another founding member, The Muslim American Society, has been described by federal prosecutors as the â€œovert armâ€? of the Muslim Brotherhood in the U.S.\nIn a related development, Hillary Clinton used an appearance at a panel last week sponsored by the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) to condemn Ted Cruzâ€™s statements about radical Islam as pitting groups against one another and giving in to fear.? In reporting Clintonâ€™s remarks, no one in the mainstream media mentioned MPACâ€™s extremism and how it has followed a consistent pattern of defending designated terrorist organizations and their supporters, opposing U.S. counterterrorism efforts and spouting anti-Semitic rhetoric.?\nThe battle to defeat ISIS and Al Qaeda requires recognizing and defeating a radical ideology that is at war with Western civilization: radical Islam.?\nAlan Rappeportâ€™s article and Hillary Clintonâ€™s MPAC panel proves that they, like President Obama, are still in denial about this threat.?\nTed Cruz has the best understanding of radical Islam of all the presidential candidates and the best strategy to defeat it.\nThis is why I was proud to endorse him to be the next president of the United States.\nFred Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy, a Washington, DC national security think tank.

The four men slipped away after the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, and all but one reappeared as key figures in the Islamic State cell that went on to attack Brussels.\nTwo are dead, one is captured, and the fate of the fourth remains a mystery.\nWhich attackers live and die in an operation can provide crucial clues as to how a terrorist cell is structured, demonstrating who is considered disposable and who is crucial for the next job. That status can be fleeting, as the attacks in Paris and Brussels show that someone considered vital in one operation may be sacrificed in another.\nSome of the figures in the Paris plot had become "cannon fodder" by the time of the Brussels attacks, said Nicolas Henin, a journalist held hostage by Islamic State for 10 months.\n"Once they had performed their services in Paris, they were considered expendable," he wrote. "That is how (the Islamic State group) works in terms of human resources."\n___\nTHE BOMB MAKER\nWith a newly minted degree in mechanical engineering, Najim Laachraoui left for Syria in February 2013 ? a relatively early departure in the wave of Belgians who have traveled to fight with the extremists.\nHe returned home 2? years later as an expert in urban explosives, bearing a fake Belgian ID and an alias: Soufiane Kayal. On Sept. 9, 2015, police at the Austro-Hungarian border briefly stopped a Mercedes in which he was traveling and sent him on his way. In the car with him were Salah Abdeslam and another Islamic State recruit with a fake Belgian ID.\nNone of the three fired a shot in Paris the night of Nov. 13, but all played key roles in making it happen.\nLaachraoui's job was to manufacture the TATP explosives and the suicide vests. His DNA was found on one of the vests that detonated inside the Bataclan concert hall as well as one that blew up outside France's national stadium. The man himself was nowhere to be found.\nThirteen days later, that same DNA was found in a safe house in Belgian town of Auvelais, and authorities soon linked the name Kayal to another apartment in nearby Charleroi, where some of the November attackers had stayed before traveling convoy-style to Paris. They didn't, however, connect the alias to Laachraoui.\nThe cell, meanwhile, appears to have found another place for the smelly, dangerous process of making TATP: a top-floor flat in the Brussels suburb of Schaerbeek. In hiding, at least one experienced bomb maker kept busy.\nCriminals like TATP because it's relatively easy to acquire its ingredients, but the manufacturing process is volatile. In 1995, a plot to assassinate the pope and President Bill Clinton unraveled when a makeshift TATP lab in Manila caught fire, drawing the attention of authorities.\nWithout a real laboratory, the bomb maker would have needed tremendous care and steady nerves ? as well as massive amounts of ice to cool a noxious solution prone to catching fire, with windows wide open to avoid being overcome by the fumes.\nIt appears the cell was up to the task. In the Schaerbeek apartment, there was enough TATP for three massive suitcase bombs ? 15 to 20 kilograms each, experts say. There were also 15 kilograms left over and enough base materials to make 100 kilograms more, said Jimmie Oxley, a University of Rhode Island chemistry professor who specializes in explosives.\n"A master bomb maker may be in play here," Oxley said.\nBut when it came time to carry out the plot, Laachraoui's career in building bombs came to an abrupt end. On Tuesday, he was one of three men who wheeled suitcases packed with explosives into the departures hall of Brussels Airport. Laachraoui and his companion wore black, down to the single glove on their left hands believed to have concealed their detonators. The third attacker wore white, a distinctive hat slightly askew as he pushed the one load that would not kill.\nWhy Laachraoui had gone from bomb maker to suicide bomber remains unclear. Had the group found a replacement? Had he become too much of a liability as police closed in on his trail? The answer remains a mystery.\n"It's strange," said Patrick Skinner, a former CIA case officer who is now with the Soufan Group security firm. "They don't have a shortage of people that are willing to become a walking bomb, but there's always a shortage of talent. It's like having General Eisenhower lead the charge at D-Day. It's possible but it seems to be a supreme waste of talent."\n___\nTHE TRANSPORTER\nSalah Abdeslam drove thousands of miles across Europe over months, collecting accomplices, scouting locations and buying equipment. He rented apartments and cars and, on the night of Nov. 11, drove toward Paris with another onetime petty criminal and boyhood friend, Mohamed Abrini. The two were spotted together in a Renault Clio at a service station along the highway linking Paris and Brussels.\nAbdeslam ditched the car in northern Paris and is believed to have discarded his unexploded suicide vest south of the city. And he called on two friends from Brussels' Molenbeek neighborhood to drive through the night and pick him up. By then, Abdeslam's older brother Brahim was dead, the only victim of the suicide blast that demolished a bar in central Paris.\n"He has a personality that is more complex than the terrorist automaton who is just there to blow himself up," Marc Trevedic, France's former anti-terrorist judge, told BFM television. "Not fragile, but complex."\nBut it may have been more than second guessing that kept Abdeslam alive that night and for the four months he spent hiding among friends back in Brussels.\n"I think he had no desire to die, and he had other things to do," said Nathalie Goulet, a French senator and co-president of a commission that studied the jihadi networks now terrorizing Europe. "They escape, they gather back home, they resume, because that's their job."\nAbdeslam was flushed out on March 15, when police went to search what they thought was a vacant apartment in the Forest neighborhood of Brussels and instead were sprayed with gunfire. One man wielding a Kalashnikov held officers at bay as two others bolted across rooftops to safety. One of them was Salah Abdeslam. The second man remains unidentified.\nOne or both were important enough that the gunman kept firing until he was killed by a police sniper. Inside the apartment ? rented by the same man who exactly a week later would detonate his explosives in the Brussels metro ? was an Islamic State banner, shells and a book on Salafist Islam, the austere strain linked to the group.\nBut Abdeslam's days of freedom were numbered. By March 18, police had traced him to another hideout ? this time just around the corner from his childhood home in Molenbeek. He was shot in the leg as he tried to escape yet again. In the four days between his capture and the blasts that shook Brussels, he made no mention of a new plot afoot, nor did he explain his role in the Paris attacks, beyond what Belgian and French media described as blanket denials of responsibility or close ties to the attackers.\n___\nTHE LANDLORD\nKhalid El Bakraoui was another man with an alias and a warrant out for his arrest. He and his brother Ibrahim were known criminals, bank robbers and car thieves with a string of convictions between them.\nInterpol issued an international warrant for his arrest in December ? soon after it was discovered he had rented the Charleroi apartment that served as a departure point for some of the Paris killers.\nIt took investigators until Dec. 9 to track down that safe house ? enough time that El Bakraoui was again entrusted with scouting locations for the network's growing number of accomplices and possibly for a new attack. Belgian media say the brothers had video of the home of a senior official at a nuclear waste facility in the Flanders region.\nIt was El Bakraoui who rented the Forest safe house and was seen leaving the Schaerbeek apartment that served as the explosives warehouse for Tuesday's attacks.\nBut he apparently ensured that his own home was scrubbed clean of links to Islamic State or the attacks. On Wednesday morning, investigators searched the homes of the El Bakraoui brothers and came up empty.\nBy then, the brothers were dead, Khalid in the Maelbeek metro station, his brother at the airport. When shown a photo of the brothers, Abdeslam claimed he did not know them.\n___\nTHE CIPHER\nMohamed Abrini, a 31-year-old Belgian petty criminal and boyhood friend of the Abdeslams, is believed to have traveled early last summer to Syria, a short trip to the country where his younger brother died in 2014 in Islamic State's notorious francophone brigade.\nBut that wasn't his only international travel. He went multiple times to Birmingham, England, meeting with several men suspected of terrorist activity, according to a European security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to provide details on the investigation. He said the meetings, including one later last summer, took place in several locations, including cafes and apartments.\nAbrini's role in the subsequent weeks and months while the Paris attackers were coming together has never been clarified. He has been on the run since the Nov. 13 attacks but never resurfaced after the emergence of the surveillance video placing him in the convoy with the attackers headed to Paris. Like Abdeslam, he

Did we miss anything? Certainly. Otherwise these attacks would not have happened,"?Yvan Mayeur said in Paris.

That's a concept we have to revisit."\nHidalgo pledged solidarity with Belgium as it begins "a long and painful process of grieving and reconstruction."\nMayeur is also meeting Parisian first responders Tuesday and holding a minute of silence for victims of last week's attack on Brussels' airport and subway system, and for victims of a weekend attack in Lahore, Pakistan. Thirty-five people were killed in Brussels, while 72 people were killed in Pakistan.\nUnderground rail services were back up and running Tuesday in Brussels, but mostly under heavy guard.\nThe metro trains through the Belgian capital are less frequent and only stop at about half the stations. The Maelbeek station hit by a suicide bomber in the morning rush hour remains closed.\nOne stop away, Franz Alderweireldt, 82, told The Associated Press Tuesday that he takes the subway every day but said, "I think this is not over."\nHe added, "When terrorists plan an attack, they will do it no matter what, even if there are dozens or hundreds of soldiers or police on the street."\nDebaprasad Kar, an insurance company employee, said he has been working from home for the past week.

The laptop turned up inside a trash can after investigators raided a street in?Schaerbeek, the Brussels neighborhood known as a hub for the attackers, the New York Times adds.\nSecurity around Prime Minister Charles Michel has increased since the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris and in Brussels last week. Michel also has had several unspecified death threats over the past years, the official said. Still, the official told the AP that at the moment there were "absolutely no" specific indications that Michel was under threat from the attackers.\nThe laptop first gained notoriety because it contained a sort of will of suicide bomber Ibrahim El Bakraoui, in which he spoke of being "in a haste" and "no longer know what to do."\nThe computer was also "full of stuff" on many locations around Brussels in information garnered from the Internet, said an official linked to the investigation.\nIn propaganda material distributed Tuesday, the Islamic State terror group described the Brussels attacks as part of "a war against all their tyrants and pagans; a war against secularism." The material showed a cropped still of surveillance footage showing the two airport bombers. The attacker who escaped with his life, wearing a dark hat, was cropped out.\n"Its most important results are that it showed the fragility of the security systems of the European states that claim they are the strongest in the world, and this was through the type of operation, its timing, its place, and the circumstances surrounding it, and the nature of those who executed it," the material said, according to a translation Wednesday by the SITE Intelligence Group.\nIn all, 32 people died in the attacks on Brussels international airport and the Maelbeek subway station and 87 remained in hospital. Three attackers were killed when their bombs exploded and police are looking for at least one more suspect.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

(AP/SANA)\nThe recapture of Palmyra in central Syria from Islamic State militants puts government forces at the heart of the fight against the jihadist group ? and not just geographically speaking.\nFor President Bashar Assad, recapturing the historic town represents a strategic political coup through which he hopes to convince the West that the Syrian army is a credible partner in combatting terrorism as it ramps up the fight against Islamic State.\nIt is an awkward argument that the U.S. has repeatedly rebuffed. Officials in Washington are quick to point out that it was Assad's brutal crackdown on his own people that created the kind of vacuum that allowed extremists like ISIS to flourish in the first place.\nAn alliance between the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS ? similar to the assistance and training provided to the Iraqi military on the other front in the war ? seems out of the question.\nBut with the international focus now on fighting the Islamic State group ? and a partial cease-fire in place to facilitate that ? there appears to be tacit U.S. approval for at least this part of Assad's offensive in Syria to continue. If that is seen to develop, it could help the authoritarian ruler survive a ruinous 5-year-old conflict that has seen half the country's population displaced.\nThe desert town of Palmyra, with its 2,000-year-old ruins, is an archaeological gem and a cherished landmark known endearingly to Syrians as the "Bride of the Desert." It is also a strategic crossroads linking the Syrian capital, Damascus, with the country's east and the border with Iraq.\n"It's a fantastic public relations coup," said Thomas Pierret, a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, describing Palmyra's recapture. The Syrian government recognizes the Western "obsession" with the town's ancient ruins, and "they're exploiting it and it works very well," he said.\nGovernment forces recaptured Palmyra on Sunday, scoring an important victory over Islamic State fighters who had overseen a 10-month reign of terror in the town. It dealt the extremist group its first major defeat at the hands of government forces in years.\nDuring their stay, the extremists destroyed some of Palmyra's best-known monuments, including two large temples dating back more than 1,800 years and a Roman triumphal arch. The militants also used the ancient Roman amphitheater for public killings, including a video they released showing 25 boys with pistols shooting captured Syrian soldiers, with the colonnades in the background.\nThe government troops, joined by Iranian-backed militiamen, were supported by massive Russian airpower throughout their three-week offensive. When they swept victoriously into Palmyra, they emphasized the care taken by the army not to harm the archaeological sites.\nSyrian officials said Palmyra would become a launching pad for operations against ISIS strongholds in Raqqa to the north and Deir el-Zour farther east ? efforts that are expected to be much more difficult. On Tuesday, Syrian troops battled ISIS militants around the nearby town of Qaryatain, trying to extend their gains.\nAssad said the victory was "new evidence of the effectiveness of the strategy followed by the Syrian army and its allies in the war against terrorism." Syria's U.N. ambassador, Bashar Ja'afari, offered in an interview with the Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen to work with the U.S., and said it was time for powers including Washington to join Moscow in working with Damascus.\nUnlike in Iraq, the U.S. has long suffered from the lack of reliable or credible partner in Syria. Apart from the Kurds, the Obama administration's attempts to train and partner with Syrian rebels have all ended in failure.\nU.S. officials recall that Assad has largely ignored ISIS gains in Syria in recent years, focusing instead on moderate Syrian rebels he deems a bigger threat. Critics point out that Assad's forces all but handed Palmyra over to the militants in May, as officers hurriedly fled the town in the face of ISIS advances.\n"While there can be no doubting that ISIS' loss of Palmyra represents a substantial strategic blow to their operations in Syria, this is the Assad regime's first major victory against the group-after its presence on its territory for three years," wrote Charles Lister, a resident fellow with the Middle East Institute, in an article published by the think tank.\nStill, the recapture won Assad rare praise from international officials, including the UNESCO chief who welcomed the "liberation" of Palmyra and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who said he was "encouraged" that Syrian government forces were now in control.\nIn the last year, the United States has softened demands for Assad's to quickly leave power. But the U.S. doesn't believe that Syria's civil war can truly end with Assad still running the country and has been pushing Russia and Iran to support a transition process with a timeline for Assad's departure.\nAssad's latest Russian-backed offensive hasn't changed that thinking.\nOn Monday, State Department spokesman John Kirby described the reconquering of Palmyra as a "good thing." He quickly balanced that assessment by adding that "the best hope for the Syrian people is not an expansion of Bashar Assad's ability to tyrannize the Syrian people. We all know that over the long term, the Syrian army under his command cannot bring peace to Syria."\nKirby declined to congratulate Assad's government for the military success, and said he didn't think it would prove able to retake other parts of Syria. Assad "is responsible for the civil war that has, in fact, helped grow a group like Daesh," he said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.\nU.S. cooperation with the Syrian army is unrealistic in the current context of the Syrian civil war. But Syrian observers say there appears to be a U.S.-Russian understanding that the combined forces of Syrian troops backed by Russia and Syria's Kurds backed by the U.S. is emerging as the best and most realistic fighting force against IS in the next weeks and months.\nThe victory in Palmyra also puts Assad in a more comfortable position ahead of negotiations that are scheduled to resume in Geneva in mid-April, making it less likely he will accept to engage in meaningful talks on a political transition.\n"Now that Assad is this hero, savior of the heritage of humanity, how could you impose upon him a transition that sidelines him eventually?" Pierret said sarcastically.\nLister said having recaptured Palmyra in a widely reported military operation conducted with Russian support, "there is now no reason at all for Bashar Assad to even get close to considering a political transition."\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

(AP)\nSyrian engineering teams and popular defense groups uncovered a mass grave in a neighborhood in the newly recaptured ancient city of Palmyra, Syriaâ€™s state-news agency reported Friday.\nThe remains of about 40 people, 23 of them women and children, were found in the graves. SANA news agency reported they were killed by Islamic State militants and said some of the bodies were beheaded and bore signs of torture.\nSyrian army experts detonated hundreds of mines they say were planted by the Islamic State before they were forced out of Palmyra last Sunday, according to the Associated Press.\nReporters were able to tour the archaeological gem that had attracted tens of thousands of tourists every year before the Islamic State captured the city and destroyed most of its Christian artifacts. While, some parts of the site, including the Roman-era grand colonnades and amphitheater appeared relatively untouched, the damage every else was very much visible.\nAccording to the Associated Press, the Arch of Triumph ? which was under the Roman emperor Septimus Severus between A.D. 193 and A.D. 211, has been reduced to a pile of stones. The monumental arch once sat atop the famed colonnaded streets of the ancient town.\nThe Temple of Baalshamin and parts of the Temple of Bel, one of the best-preserved Roman-era sites, are also destroyed.\nThe town was completely deserted Friday, except for Syrian army soldiers working on dismantling explosives and visiting journalists. The town is completely deserted; its remaining residents had fled as the Syrian armyâ€™s offensive against ISIS began last month.\nTraces of the fighting could be seen all around. Burned cars parked on the side of the road, electricity cables strewn about on the streets, and scattered empty water tanks apparently used as barricades.\nAt the entrance to the Roman amphitheater, where the Islamic State filmed children shooting captive Syrian soldiers in the head, black graffiti is sprayed on a stone wall.\n"Lasting and Expanding," it read in Arabic, a logo of the Islamic State group. "The Islamic State" is scribbled on another nearby wall.\nA Syrian officer told reporters that more than 3,000 mines have so far been dismantled. "They booby-trapped everything, trees, doors, animals," he said, speaking of the militants. Russian sappers have arrived in Syria to help the Syrian army clear mines in and around the town.\nPalmyra is located about 155 miles east of Damascus, the Syrian capital. Government troops, backed by allied militiamen and Russian airstrikes retook the town on Sunday from ISIS extremists who had controlled Palmyra and its environs for 10 months.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

(Al-Nusra Front via AP) (The Associated Press)\nPrevious Next\nDAMASCUS, Syria ? ?A week after taking back the historic town of Palmyra, Syrian troops and their allies on Sunday captured another town controlled by the Islamic State group in central Syria, state media reported.\nThe push into the town of Qaryatain took place under the cover of Russian airstrikes and dealt another setback to the IS extremists in Syria. However, an activist group that monitors the Syrian civil war said the government forces for the moment control more than half of Qaryatain but have not fully secured the town.\nThe advance came a week after Syrian forces recaptured Palmyra from IS and is strategically significant for the government side. The town of Qaryatain used to be home to a sizable Christian population and lies midway between Palmyra and the capital, Damascus.\nActivists said last summer that Qaryatain had a mixed population of around 40,000 Sunni Muslims and Christians, as well as thousands of internally displaced people who had fled from the nearby city of Homs. Many of the Christians fled the town after it came under IS attack.\nDozens of Qaryatain's Christians and other residents have been abducted by the extremists. While the town was under IS control, some were released, others were made to sign pledges to pay a tax imposed on non-Muslims.\nWhile IS extremists blew up and destroyed some of the world's most precious relics at Palmyra's archaeological site during their 10-month reign of terror there, the ancient Saint Eliane Monastery near Qaryatain was also bulldozed and destroyed shortly after IS took the town in August.\nChristians make up about 10 percent of Syria's prewar population of 23 million people.\nState news agency SANA said government forces were currently dismantling bombs placed by extremists inside Qaryatain. The report said Syrian troops were fully in control of the town after "wiping out Daesh terrorists inside it," referring to IS by the group's Arabic acronym.\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said intense fighting was underway in Qaryatain as government troops fight to capture all parts of the town. The Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said IS fighters are still in control of eastern parts and southeastern areas of the town but "are on the verge of collapse." Abdurrahman added that some of the extremists have started withdrawing toward eastern parts of the mountainous Qalamoun region.\nIS has suffered major defeats in Syria over the past months amid intense airstrikes by Russian warplanes.\nEarlier Sunday, the Observatory reported that fighting in northern Syria the previous day killed several fighters belonging to the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group. Hezbollah has been fighting alongside President Bashar Assad's troops in Syria's civil war.\nThe Observatory said 12 Hezbollah fighters were killed and dozens were wounded in Saturday's attack by militants led by al-Qaida's Syria branch ? known as the Nusra Front ? on the northern village of al-Ais.\nIn southern Lebanon, social media postings on Sunday carried photos of seven Hezbollah fighters said to be among those killed in al-Ais.\nThough Nusra Front is not part of a U.S.-Russia-engineered truce between the Syrian government forces and Western-backed rebels, the fighting has threated to undermine the cease-fire that has held for over a month.\n___\n	foxnews	World

Clinton told NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press,â€? in response to suggestions that she is avoiding a debate with Sanders in her adopted home state of New York ahead of its April 19 primary.\nSanders, a Brooklynite who has won five of the last six primaries or caucuses, has challenged Clinton to a debate in delegate-rich New York.\nThe Clinton campaign has offered a few dates -- including a weekday morning and at the same time as Monday nightâ€™s NCAA menâ€™s basketball champions -- that the Sanders campaign and others see as less than optimal for viewership.\nStill, Clinton said she was â€œconfidentâ€? about the debate happening.\nLate Sunday, the Sanders campaign countered by saying the candidate is available to debate April 10, 11, 12 or 13.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nSanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs also said the Clinton campaign â€œdisingenuouslyâ€? announced that it had agreed to a debate on a day when it knew Sanders already had locked in park permits for a major rally in New York City.\n"Letâ€™s stop the silly political games,â€? Briggs said. â€œLetâ€™s get on with debating the candidatesâ€™ stands on serious issues affecting New York and the United States.â€?\nBriggs said in a statement late Sunday that Sanders accepted an invitation for a prime-time debate on April 10 on NBC News.\n"We hope the Clinton campaign also accepts. The April 10 debate date is one of four dates that the Sanders campaign had proposed for a debate with Secretary Clinton before the New York primary election," he said.\nClinton had no public events Sunday in Wisconsin, where some polls show Sanders with a slight lead.\nThough she has attempted to focus her resources of late on a general election race with GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Clinton also made clear Sunday that Sanders remains a political threat.\nâ€œI certainly haven't moved on,â€? she told NBC. â€œI know that I still have work to do to win the nomination.â€?\nShe also repeated her regret for using a private email server for official communications while secretary of state, amid nagging concerns about her trustworthiness, and said the FBI had not contacted her about being interviewed regarding its investigation of the email matter.\nSanders and the top two GOP presidential candidates, Trump and Cruz, were campaigning Sunday in Wisconsin.\nTrump, the Republican front-runner, doubled-down Sunday night on his comments that the US should â€œdo a better dealâ€? with Japan, South Korea and other allies, saying they should pay more for Americaâ€™s protection while taking a greater role in their defense ? including building their own nuclear weapons.\nResponding to questions at a Fox News Channel â€œOn the Recordâ€? town hall two days before the Wisconsin primary ? where polls show he trails Cruz ? Trump also said that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour wasnâ€™t good for business or jobs creation.\n"If you start raising that minimum wage, you're going to make a lot of our companies even more non-competitive," he said.\nTrump also delved into his plans to change the nation's tax code by "simplifying" it.\n"The very rich are probably going to end up paying more, but there's an incentive for them to invest and create jobs in the country," he said.\nThe other Republican candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, told ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€? that the Republican convention -- which could happen in July without a clear nominee based on delegate wins -- could be a civics lesson for the country.\nâ€œKids will spend less time focusing on Bieber and Kardashian and more time focusing on how we elect presidents," said Kasich, who has won only Ohio. "It will be so cool."\nTrump on Sunday called for Kasich to drop out of the race, arguing he shouldn't be allowed to continue accumulating delegates if he has no chance of being the nominee ? a call repeated during Sunday nightâ€™s Fox News town hall.\nTrump has 736 pledged delegates, followed by Cruz with 463, then Kasich with 143 -- with 1,237 needed to secure the nomination.\nTrump, however, after a difficult week, now trails Cruz in Wisconsin, after some polls showed him leading by double-digits several weeks ago.\nTrump said Sunday that Kasich could be considered as a nominee at the GOP convention in July even without competing in the remaining nominating contests.\nTrump told reporters at a Milwaukee diner that he had relayed his concerns to Republican National Committee officials at a meeting in Washington this past week.\n"He's taking my votes," Trump said about Kasich.\nThe Kasich campaign tried to flip the script, contending that neither Trump nor Cruz would have enough delegates to win the nomination outright going into the convention.\n"Since he thinks it's such a good idea, we look forward to Trump dropping out before the convention," said Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf.\nTrump's declaration came as Republican concerns grew about the prospect of convention chaos if Trump fails to lock up his party's nomination -- or even if he does.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Bernie Sanders ?will win. The Vermont senator and his campaign leaders have been all over the media in the last several weeks calling on? Hillary Clinton ?committed superdelegates to switch to Sanders. Their argument: Sanders is the more popular candidate and thus such a switch would be consistent with "small d" democratic principles.\nSanders is making this argument because he has done the math and knows that this is his most realistic way to capture the Democratic nomination.\nSo far, in the 35 primaries and caucuses prior to Wisconsin, Clinton has won a total of 1,712 delegates (1,243 elected pledged delegates, 469 superdelegates), while Sanders has 1,011 delegates (980 pledged, 31 superdelegates). Thus, before Wisconsin votes, Clinton leads by 701 delegates. According to a? story ?on Sunday by the Associated Press, this means "Sanders must win about 67 percent of the remaining delegates and uncommitted superdelegates ... through June to be able to clinch the Democratic nomination."\nThis is made even more difficult by the nature of the remaining 22 contests.\nThey include only three more caucuses (a system that favors Sanders, as we have seen, since the low-turnout caucuses, as compared to primaries, give progressive activists a decided advantage).\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nMoreover, 13 out of the 22 primaries are "closed," meaning only registered Democrats can vote. This heavily favors Clinton, based on past results, since Clinton has consistently received double-digit margins among Democrats over Sanders. This might be a result of Sanders insisting through the years that he is not a Democrat, since he previously ran as an independent. He's only recently called himself a Democrat. Clinton has benefited from primaries limited to registered Democrats because Sanders cannot compete with her decades of work and support for the Democratic Party, its principles and candidates, and her substantial following among Democrats across the country.\nSo it appears that, realistically, the best way Sanders can win the nomination is to persuade large numbers of superdelegates publicly committed to Clinton to switch and support Sanders because, as the Vermont senator argues, to do so would be faithful to "small d" democratic principles.\nOf course, that argument is contradicted by the facts: By any measure of democracy, Clinton is winning by a large margin and deserves the support of superdelegates.\nFirst,?she has won 2.5 million more votes?than Sanders in the 35 Democratic primaries and caucuses held so far, a landslide margin of 58 percent to 42 percent to date.\nSecond, Clinton leads among elected pledged delegates from those 35 contests by 263 delegates ? 1,243 to 980, or 56 percent to 44 percent. Last time I looked, elected pledged delegates were a product of democratic processes.\nFinally, superdelegates hardly can be described as "anti-democratic." To the contrary. I was a Democratic National Committee member elected by hundreds of Democratic committee members from Maryland in 1982 when superdelegates were first created. We did so by a large margin (I believe the vote was nearly unanimous) because we believed elected governors, senators and House members, who received millions or hundreds of thousands of votes, were far more representative of the broad electorate ? racially, economically, religiously, ideologically ? than the relatively small fraction of eligible Democrats and independents who participated in party primaries and particularly the low-turnout caucuses.\nHillary Clinton Presidential Candidate Profile | InsideGov\nIt is a somewhat amazing argument that delegates elected in the Idaho Democratic caucuses, where just 24,000 voters turned out statewide and where Sanders won by a margin of 14,000 votes over Clinton, reflect a more democratic choice than senators who are elected with millions of votes. I guess it depends on your definition of "democracy."\nIn any event, the party rules were adopted many years ago allowing superdelegates to be unpledged delegates because of their status as elected and party officials. The rules allowing superdelegates to vote at the 2016 convention were specifically approved by the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Let's remember that DNC members are democratically elected by Democratic Party officials from virtually all of the states and jurisdictions that participate in caucuses and primary elections.\nSurely, Sanders cannot be seeking the votes of superdelegates at the same time he is repudiating their right to vote as unpledged delegates.\nSurely, he cannot be thinking about changing the rules of the game after the game is in process ? simply because he is behind.\nSurely, the senator can't claim with a straight face that, although he is behind Clinton by 2.5 million votes as of now, democratic principles dictate that superdelegates committed to Clinton should switch to him.\nSurely he can't.\nBut if he does, will the media let him get away with it?\nStay tuned.\nClick here to read this post on The Hill .\nLanny Davis served as special counsel to former President Bill Clinton and is principal in the Washington, D.C. law firm of Lanny J.

The state has waged a long war against the â€œspecial interestsâ€? of politically inclined union bosses and their crony relations with Washington power brokers.?\nUnder Governor Scott Walker?who endorsed the Texas senator prior to primary day?the state has reigned in the power of Big Labor by establishing â€œright-to-workâ€? and democratizing the union voting process.\nBeginning in 2011, the Wisconsin governor used labor reform?from prohibiting mandatory dues to guaranteeing recertification elections?to hold the union political machine accountable to the rank-and-file. In? Walkerâ€™s words , â€œWe took the power away from the big-government special interests and put it firmly in the hands of the hard-working taxpayers.â€?\nThat message is right up Cruzâ€™s alley: â€œWhat you all have done in the state of Wisconsin is exactly what we need to do in Washington,â€? he? recently told radio host Charlie Sykes . â€œWhen [Governor Walker] and millions of men and women across Wisconsin stood up and took on the union bosses, it was powerful, it inspired people across the country.â€?\nThe inspiration says something about Big Laborâ€™s political clout. Union bosses have long been the Democratic Partyâ€™s personal ATM, even though about 40 percent of union members vote Republican in any given election cycle.?\nNew research ?from the Center for Union Facts shows Americaâ€™s major labor unions donated more than $418 million to the Democratic Party and left-wing special interest groups from 2012 to 2014. Almost $150 million wound up with think tanks supportive of a job-killing $15 minimum wage?now adopted in California?and other liberal initiatives. NextGen Climate and other radical environmental groups received millions in funding, as did left-wing media outlets including?The Nation?and?In?These Times.?\nAmong the ten major recipients of union money were the Democratic Governors Association ($7.8 million) and Catalist ($5.1 million). The latter is a leading Democratic data firm and has been described as â€œ[President] Obamaâ€™s? database ?for transforming America.â€?\nThey werenâ€™t the only winners. Democracy Alliance?George Sorosâ€™ secretive network of liberal donors?received more than $2 million in union money from 2012 to 2014, while the Clinton Foundation made off with over $1.3 million.?(Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has received her fair share of union endorsements.)\nMuch to the chagrin of the roughly 40 percent of union members voting Republican, Big Labor is effectively one large Democratic Super PAC?a fact that even Howard Dean? recently acknowledged .?\nItâ€™s why Cruz has made it his mission to confront the union political machine and take Governor Walkerâ€™s reforms national. He is a vocal supporter of the Employee Rights Act (ERA), national legislation which would update American labor law to protect union employees. (Walker also supported the bill as a presidential candidate.) Now co-sponsored by more than 120 members of Congress, the ERA would require union bosses to obtain opt-in permission from their members before spending their dues money supporting political interest groups.\nIf the 2016 election has made one thing clear, itâ€™s that taking on â€œspecial interestsâ€? will win votes?in Wisconsin and beyond. And thereâ€™s no bigger â€œspecial interestâ€? than Big Labor.?\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.

Clinton told NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press,â€? in response to suggestions that she is avoiding a debate with Sanders in her adopted home state of New York ahead of its April 19 primary.\nSanders, a Brooklynite who has won five of the last six primaries or caucuses, has challenged Clinton to a debate in delegate-rich New York.\nThe Clinton campaign has offered a few dates -- including a weekday morning and at the same time as Monday nightâ€™s NCAA menâ€™s basketball champions -- that the Sanders campaign and others see as less than optimal for viewership.\nStill, Clinton said she was â€œconfidentâ€? about the debate happening.\nLate Sunday, the Sanders campaign countered by saying the candidate is available to debate April 10, 11, 12 or 13.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nSanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs also said the Clinton campaign â€œdisingenuouslyâ€? announced that it had agreed to a debate on a day when it knew Sanders already had locked in park permits for a major rally in New York City.\n"Letâ€™s stop the silly political games,â€? Briggs said. â€œLetâ€™s get on with debating the candidatesâ€™ stands on serious issues affecting New York and the United States.â€?\nBriggs said in a statement late Sunday that Sanders accepted an invitation for a prime-time debate on April 10 on NBC News.\n"We hope the Clinton campaign also accepts. The April 10 debate date is one of four dates that the Sanders campaign had proposed for a debate with Secretary Clinton before the New York primary election," he said.\nClinton had no public events Sunday in Wisconsin, where some polls show Sanders with a slight lead.\nThough she has attempted to focus her resources of late on a general election race with GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Clinton also made clear Sunday that Sanders remains a political threat.\nâ€œI certainly haven't moved on,â€? she told NBC. â€œI know that I still have work to do to win the nomination.â€?\nShe also repeated her regret for using a private email server for official communications while secretary of state, amid nagging concerns about her trustworthiness, and said the FBI had not contacted her about being interviewed regarding its investigation of the email matter.\nSanders and the top two GOP presidential candidates, Trump and Cruz, were campaigning Sunday in Wisconsin.\nTrump, the Republican front-runner, doubled-down Sunday night on his comments that the US should â€œdo a better dealâ€? with Japan, South Korea and other allies, saying they should pay more for Americaâ€™s protection while taking a greater role in their defense ? including building their own nuclear weapons.\nResponding to questions at a Fox News Channel â€œOn the Recordâ€? town hall two days before the Wisconsin primary ? where polls show he trails Cruz ? Trump also said that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour wasnâ€™t good for business or jobs creation.\n"If you start raising that minimum wage, you're going to make a lot of our companies even more non-competitive," he said.\nTrump also delved into his plans to change the nation's tax code by "simplifying" it.\n"The very rich are probably going to end up paying more, but there's an incentive for them to invest and create jobs in the country," he said.\nThe other Republican candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, told ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€? that the Republican convention -- which could happen in July without a clear nominee based on delegate wins -- could be a civics lesson for the country.\nâ€œKids will spend less time focusing on Bieber and Kardashian and more time focusing on how we elect presidents," said Kasich, who has won only Ohio. "It will be so cool."\nTrump on Sunday called for Kasich to drop out of the race, arguing he shouldn't be allowed to continue accumulating delegates if he has no chance of being the nominee ? a call repeated during Sunday nightâ€™s Fox News town hall.\nTrump has 736 pledged delegates, followed by Cruz with 463, then Kasich with 143 -- with 1,237 needed to secure the nomination.\nTrump, however, after a difficult week, now trails Cruz in Wisconsin, after some polls showed him leading by double-digits several weeks ago.\nTrump said Sunday that Kasich could be considered as a nominee at the GOP convention in July even without competing in the remaining nominating contests.\nTrump told reporters at a Milwaukee diner that he had relayed his concerns to Republican National Committee officials at a meeting in Washington this past week.\n"He's taking my votes," Trump said about Kasich.\nThe Kasich campaign tried to flip the script, contending that neither Trump nor Cruz would have enough delegates to win the nomination outright going into the convention.\n"Since he thinks it's such a good idea, we look forward to Trump dropping out before the convention," said Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf.\nTrump's declaration came as Republican concerns grew about the prospect of convention chaos if Trump fails to lock up his party's nomination -- or even if he does.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Ted Cruz and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders scored big victories in Wisconsin's presidential primaries Tuesday, dampening Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's hopes of wrapping up the race any time soon -- and putting heavy pressure on the front-runners to recapture the momentum in contests later this month.?\nBoth Cruz and Sanders charged out of Wisconsin claiming momentum was turning in their favor. Sanders, who notched his sixth victory in the last seven state contests, won every county in the Badger State except Milwaukee.\nâ€œAnd we have won almost all of them with overwhelming, landslide numbers,â€? Sanders told an ebullient crowd of supporters Tuesday night.\nSanders was speaking in Wyoming, which holds a caucus contest this weekend. But the next big primary will be in New York on April 19, and Sanders has vowed to take on Clinton in her adopted home state.?\nCruz also pointed to his win Tuesday as a sign the tides are turning against Republican front-runner Trump, who faced one of the roughest weeks of his campaign going into the primary.?\n"Tonight is a turning point," Cruz declared at a rally in Milwaukee. "It is a rallying cry. It is a call from the hard-working men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America: we have a choice. A real choice."?\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nYet Cruz, despite winning in Wisconsin and outmaneuvering Trump lately in the grueling battle for delegates, still faces challenging terrain in the weeks ahead. Trump has a clear lead in New York polls, and his campaign claimed "total confidence" they would win that race.?\nTrump's campaign also put out a biting statement Tuesday night that said Cruz was "worse than a puppet--- he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump."?\nEven if Trump holds his ground in New York, however, Cruz's Wisconsin win only increases the odds that the Republican Party will hold its first open convention in four decades this July, a scenario Trump seemed to be referring to. ?\nAny candidate would need 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination before then, and Cruz's Wisconsin victory makes that number very difficult for Trump to obtain.?\nWith 77 percent of precincts reporting, Cruz lead with 49 percent of the vote to Trump's 34 percent. Ohio Gov. John Kasich was trailing far behind on 14 percent of the vote.\nExit polls showed disquiet about Trump among Wisconsin Republicans. In the survey of 1,532 primary voters, 58 percent of respondents said they were concerned or scared about the prospect of Trump being elected president. More concerningly for the Trump campaign, 37 percent said they would not vote for him if he faced Clinton in November's general election.?\nOn the Democratic side, returns showed Sanders with 56 percent of the vote to Clinton's 44 percent with 80 percent of precincts reporting.\nThe victory helps fuel Sanders' argument that the Democratic primary is far from over, even as front-runner Clinton tries to turn her attention to the general election.?\nExit polls in the Democratic race show Sanders won in part with the help of independent voters, 71 percent of whom broke for the Vermont senator.\nWhile the Cruz and Sanders wins in Wisconsin won't necessarily shorten the odds on either winning their partyâ€™s nomination, the losses by the front-runners keep an aura of uncertainty hanging over both races.\nCruz, enjoying the support of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, campaigned harder than anybody in the Midwestern state. Buoyed by conservative talk show hosts and others opposed to a Trump bid, the Texas senator led in most GOP polls leading up to Tuesdayâ€™s primary.\nFor Trump, the long lead-up to Wisconsin's contest has included one of the worst stretches of his candidacy. He was embroiled in a spat involving Cruz's wife, which he now says he regrets, was sidetracked by his campaign manager's legal problems after an altercation with a female reporter, and stumbled awkwardly in comments about abortion.\nStill, Trump made a spirited final push in the state. His campaign said Tuesday night he withstood an "onslaught of the establishment" in Wisconsin.?\nComplicating the primary landscape for both Cruz and Trump is the continuing candidacy of Kasich. The Ohio governor's only victory has come in his home state, but he's still picking up delegates that would otherwise help Trump inch closer to the nomination or help Cruz catch up.\nTrump has joined Cruz in calling for Kasich to end his campaign. But Kasich cast Trump's focus on him as a sign that he's best positioned to win over the businessman's supporters.\nFor Republicans, 42 delegates were at stake Tuesday. According to an Associated Press count late Tuesday, Cruz won 33 of 36 allocated Wisconsin delegates, with six still outstanding. With the latest results factored in, Trump has 740 delegates to Cruz's 514. Kasich is a distant third with 143 delegates.?\nFor Democrats, 86 delegates were on the line Tuesday in Wisconsin. With his victory, Sanders won 45 delegates to Clinton's 31, with 10 delegates outstanding, according to an Associated Press count. When including superdelegates, the party officials who can back any candidate, Clinton holds 1,743 delegates to Sanders' 1,056. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.\nOn the eve of voting in Wisconsin, Clinton's campaign manager argued that Sanders' only path to victory "relies on overturning the will of the voters." In a memo to supporters, Robby Mook wrote that Sanders' strategy now is "a combination of trying to flip pledged delegates at state and county conventions, while also convincing superdelegates that he deserves their support."\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Sign up? here. **\nPRESENTING YOUR WISCONSIN FIELD GUIDE\nIn an unprecedented moment in modern politics, both American political parties have arrived at a crossroads in Wisconsin today.\nWill Hillary Clintonâ€™s struggle to quell socialist enthusiasm within her party turn harder than cheering for the Vikings at Lambeau Field? Will Donald Trump see his path to outright victory narrow to the width of a strand of string cheese?\nThereâ€™s been lots of polling, much of it from reputable sources, so we have some contours for the two primary contests today. But if you really want to know how the elections will go, get to know the people.\nWith than in mind, here is your field guide for todayâ€™s primaries. On, Wisconsin!\n[Watch Fox: After a break in the primaries, the AEHQ team is back with Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier leading tonightâ€™s Wisconsin primary coverage.]\nGOPâ€™S HOME TURF\nWisconsin was never favorable territory for GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. While it is loaded with the older, white voters than have helped him in other states, it is also home to many college-educated and prosperous voters of the kind that have refused Trump.\nBut that didnâ€™t necessarily mean that it would be favorable ground for Texas firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz, who has consistently led in recent polling. Wisconsin, of course, was originally intended to be in the column of its governor, Scott Walker, an early casualty in the GOP Game of Thrones.\nAnd if it wasnâ€™t Walker one would suppose that a more moderate candidate than Cruz would be Badger State Republicansâ€™ pick. As the election shifted to be a referendum on Trump, however, Cruzâ€™s candidacy took on new significance even to Republicans who might not have initially preferred him.\nCruz looks to Wisconsin today not just to deny Trump delegates. A delegate shutout would leave Trump to try to win 70 percent of delegates in remaining contests win outright, an unlikely achievement. That would be bad for Trump, but not necessarily good for Cruz. The Texan is looking to shoot the moon with a delegate sweep and a majority, not plurality, win to improve his own difficult delegate math.\nTo that end, Cruz has just as much to worry about from third-place Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who might poach delegates in more liberal precincts of the state, of which there are many.\nSo where will they get the votes?\n--42 total delegates\n--Winner-take-all\n--18 awarded to the statewide winner, 24 awarded to the winners of the stateâ€™s 8 congressional districts\n--Open primary\n--787,847 total ballots cast in 2012\n--Mitt Romney, 44 percent; Rick Santorum, 37 percent; Ron Paul, 11 percent; Newt Gingrich, 6 percent;\n--Polls close at 9 p.m. ET\n[GOP delegate count:?Trump?737;?Cruz?475; Kasich 143 (1,237 needed to win)]\nBEAST OF THE EAST\nBecause of its immigrant history, Wisconsin differs from many states in that the Republican stronghold is closest to the biggest city. The German immigrants who turned Milwaukee into a boom town 150 years ago and gave birth to the Republican Party left a deep imprint in the city and its suburbs. This is Walker country.\nWhile Cruz looks to excel in this region, he is fighting a two-front war. In neighboring Illinois and Michigan downscale white voters around Chicago and Detroit came out big for Trump, and we can expect the same in Milwaukee. But Cruz also has to be concerned with the moderate, mainline Republicans in places like Waukesha County.\nCruzâ€™s best hope for a big win is that voters here listen to their governorâ€™s plea that stopping Trump requires voting for Cruz, not just a vote against the frontrunner.\nKey County: Waukesha\n	foxnews	U.S.

British Prime Minister David Cameron was under pressure Tuesday April 4, 2016 to crack down on offshore tax havens, after a leak of millions of documents disclosed details of the asset-hiding arrangements of wealthy people including his late father. The Guardian newspaper revealed in 2012 that Ian Cameron, who died in 2010, used a Panamanian fund and other offshore investments to help shield investments from U.K. tax.  (Johnny Green/PA, File via AP) UNITED KINGDOM OUT (The Associated Press)\nLONDON ? ?After days of headlines about his family's financial affairs, British Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged Thursday that he profited from his father's investments in an offshore tax haven.\nCameron told ITV news that he and his wife, Samantha, sold shares worth 31,500 pounds (currently $44,300) in an offshore fund named Blairmore Holdings in January 2010 ? five months before Cameron became prime minister. They had paid 12,497 pounds for the shares in 1997. Cameron said the money was subject to British tax "in the normal ways."\nThe prime minister's father, Ian Cameron, who died in 2010, was a client of Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. Millions of documents detailing the firm's work with wealthy individuals have been leaked to the international media.\nIan Cameron, an affluent stockbroker, put money into Blairmore Holdings, which did not pay British tax.\nThere is no suggestion the arrangement was illegal, but the revelation has brought calls for David Cameron to come clean about his financial affairs. It has also given the prime minister's opponents a chance to depict him as a scion of wealth, out of touch with the financial worries of ordinary people.\nCameron has been fending off questions about his finances for days. Earlier this week, the British leader's office said the family's financial affairs were a private matter. Later Downing St. said the prime minister and his family "do not benefit from any offshore funds" ? without specifying whether they had done so in the past.\nOn Thursday, Cameron said his father's name was being "dragged through the mud," and insisted Ian Cameron's offshore fund had not been set up to avoid tax.\n"I want to be as clear as I can about the past, about the present, about the future, because frankly, I don't have anything to hide," he said.\nCameron has championed greater financial transparency in Britain and abroad, and is due to host an international anti-corruption summit in London next month.\nBut opposition politicians accuse him of failing to implement promises to reform British overseas territories that act as tax havens, including the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

(Yes, I know the entire state gets to vote?I went to college in Buffalo, in a region thatâ€™s more like Ohio?but you know that Manhattan is the center of the universe, donâ€™tcha?)\nThe press corps takes an in-your-face approach that can knock some candidates off stride. And here Donald Trump, who grew up in Queens, has the home-field advantage.?\nTrump thrived on the pugilistic media culture, which is really what turned him into a national celebrity. He knew that every jab at a Rosie Oâ€™Donnell or Leona Helmsley would produce a New York Post headline or gossip item. He speaks the lingo. When he went through his ugly divorce from Ivana while messing around with Marla Maples, the tabloids picked sides and blared every excruciating development. A presidential campaign is decorous by comparison.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nTrump wasted no time in throwing Cruzâ€™s â€œNew York valuesâ€? jibe back at him, reprising his line from past debates about the cityâ€™s brave and defiant response to 9/11.?\nCruz tried to hit back by blamingâ€¦the press. â€œNow, our friends in the media tell us that Donald Trump is unstoppable in New York State,â€? he told reporters. â€œOddly enough, our friends in the media are very comfortable with the New York liberal who has supported Andrew Cuomo, and Hillary Clinton, and Chuck Schumer for decades.â€?\nBut Cruz also got a Bronx cheer when he visited a Dominican-Chinese restaurant in that borough, attempted to speak a little Spanish and got heckled by folks declaring they didnâ€™t want some right-winger invading their immigrant community.?By yesterday he was doing another ethnic ritual, eating matzoh and pretending to like it.\nBernie Sanders, born in Brooklyn, should be on familiar turf as well. Of course, he has lived for decades in Vermont, which New Yorkers view as a good place for a skiing weekend, but it doesnâ€™t hurt that he still sounds like Larry David. There are a lot of Bernie types railing against the system in New York, but theyâ€™re usually on a college campus with a bullhorn, or at the end of a bar.\nSanders showed how long heâ€™d been away when asked about how he accesses the subway: â€œYou get a token and you go in.â€?\nHillary Clinton keeps reminding people that she represented the state for eight years as a senator. But letâ€™s face it, sheâ€™s from suburban Illinois. And she had her own subway mishap yesterday when she had trouble swiping a Metrocard to get into a subway station, years after the system stopped taking tokens.\nHillary knows the geography, the issues and the players, but in cultural terms, sheâ€™s still a carpetbagger who settled in Chappaqua.\n(And we wonâ€™t even get into John Kasich eating pizza with a fork. Whazzup with that?)\nI vividly remember covering the 1992 New York primary, when the local press whacked Bill Clinton over a series of scandals, including the womanizing and draft-dodging allegations. When I arrived at a crowded scrum, the late New York Post reporter Deborah Orin explained to me what her paper had done with that morningâ€™s punchy scandal story. â€œItâ€™s Whitewater translated into English,â€? she said. (Clinton, with help from Hillary, wound up beating Jerry Brown in that primary.)\nFour years earlier, I was based in New York when Ed Koch caused an uproar by saying that Jews would have to be â€œcrazyâ€? to vote for Jesse Jackson. That hurt his candidate, Al Gore, and Michael Dukakis carried the state with 51 percent, while Jackson got 37 percent and Gore 10 percent.\nBut itâ€™s been a long time since New York counted in presidential politics, since things are usually wrapped up before its April primary. And an even longer time since a New Yorker?you remember FDR??was a serious threat to win the White House.?\nTrump and Clinton are favored to win the Empire State, but not before running the media gauntlet. With Trump at 52 percent in the latest poll and Cruz running behind Kasich, the only question seems to be how many of the stateâ€™s 95 GOP delegates he will capture.\nBut Hillary is in a more competitive race with Bernie in a state she figured she had locked up, especially with the rhetoric heating up and Sanders accusing her of not being qualified for the presidency after he perceived her as taking a similar shot at him.\nAnd if New York's former senator, whoâ€™s on a losing streak, should get clocked in her adopted state by the Brooklyn guy?

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)\nHillary versus Bernie. The two leading democratic presidential candidates have escalated their fight for the nomination. Last night, Sanders did say he would eventually support Hillary Clinton if she were the nominee, but not without taking a bunch more digs at the front-runner.\nThe big fight started when Hillary Clinton said she doubted Bernieâ€™s bona fides as a Democrat. She also suggested he was unprepared to run the country. Sanders then attacked Hillary Clinton as unqualified to be President.\nThe Washington Post writes today:\nBernie Sanders told an AFL-CIO conference in Philadelphia yesterday â€œI will not be hustling money from the wealthy and powerful.â€?\nWith both candidates launching 10-day sprints here ahead of New York's April 19 primary, the strain and resentment of a hard-fought and unexpectedly long contest boiled over repeatedly in interviews, speeches and other public appearances. The senator from Vermont refused to retract his assertion that Clinton is not qualified to be president. Clinton dismissed that claim as "silly" and countered that Sanders has repeatedly made promises he can't keep.\nStill Sanders backtracked some in an interview with the Washington Post\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\n"Look, as I've said before, on her worst day, she is 100 times better than Donald Trump or Ted Cruz or the other candidates," he said. "To me, that is not a very hard choice."\nMeantime, former President Bill Clinton faced off with a bunch of Black Lives Matter protesters at a rally last night. Hereâ€™s how the New York Times reporter Alan Rappeport put it today:\nThe interruptions came with a frequency and fervor usually seen at a Trump rally. But on Thursday it was former President Bill Clinton facing a barrage of protests from critics who disapprove of his record on overhauling the criminal justice system.\nWhile campaigning for his wife, Hillary Clinton, at an event in Philadelphia, Mr. Clinton was forced to defend his 1994 crime bill while weathering repeated heckling. He argued that the legislation had helped African-Americans by protecting them from gangs, and he said that Black Lives Matter protesters were misguided.\nExplaining that the bill caused big declines in murders and other crime during his administration, Mr. Clinton said, ''Whose lives were saved, that mattered?''\nAlthough Mrs. Clinton has been doing well among black voters during the nominating contests, she has had to distance herself from some of her husband's policies, including the 1994 crime bill, which she implicitly suggested led to the mass incarceration of blacks. Last year Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the legislation had problems and that some of its provisions were too harsh.\nThe anger in the room on Thursday was evident, and at one point a protester shouted that Mr. Clinton should be charged with crimes against humanity. Supporters of Mrs. Clinton started waving signs and chanting ''Hillary,'' and the former president said the protests were misguided.\n''I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children,'' Mr. Clinton said as the interruptions grew louder. ''You are defending the people who kill the people whose lives you say matter. Tell the truth!''\nDonald Trump is beefing up his campaign staff and taking a few days break from the campaign trail for what some analysts call a much-needed reset. Heâ€™s made some key hires including experts who could help him in an open convention fight in Cleveland in July.\nThe New York Times reporters Nicholas Confessore and Matt Flegenheimer write about how Republicans are learning to love Ted Cruz:\nOf all the teeth-gritting alliances being forged over opposition to Mr. Trump's rampaging bid for the Republican presidential nomination, few are as unlikely as the emerging bond between Mr. Cruz and his party's elite donor establishment.\nSince Mr. Cruz's election to the Senate in 2012, many traditional Republican donors have spurned him, viewing him as a hopeless ideologue whose antics -- particularly his leading role in the 2013 government shutdown -- damaged the party in service of his ambitions.\nBut in recent weeks, at small events from the Upper East Side of Manhattan to the Republican precincts of Newport Beach, Calif., they are learning to love Mr. Cruz.\nTed Cruz will be addressing the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas. Kasich and Trump are skipping the event.\nNew polling shows huge unfavorable ratings for the top three candidates. Unfavorable ratings for Donald Trump 69%, for Ted Cruz 59%, and Hillary Clinton 55%. Whoa.\nSeven in ten people including nearly half GOP voters, have an unfavorable view of Trump.\nPresident Obama weighed in on the race last night at a fundraiser in California.

The event marked the 40th anniversary of â€œLand Day,â€? a Palestinian holiday marking protests of Israelâ€™s decision to take land in Galilee for settlements.\nâ€œThrough this event, we want to convey the message that we will hold on to the land, and that we will not forget the martyrs who sacrificed [their lives],â€? said a spokesman for the committee, Aghsan Barghouti, according to a translation provided by Palestinian Media Watch.\nâ€œTheir funding of the UAWC implicates all these institutions and organizations in the act of honoring murderers of Israelis.â€?\n- Palestinian Media Watch\nHonorees of the event, held near the Israeli settlement of Psagot, north of Jerusalem, included:\n-?????????

In addition, Palestinians have raised more than $60,000 to rebuild the home of Halabi's family, according to the Times of Israel .

In Tuesdayâ€™s exit polls, Wisconsin Democrats said by a margin of 82 percent to 16 percent that Sanders was more honest and trustworthy than Clinton. And while she beat Sanders 85 percent to 14 percent in terms of which candidate had the right experience for the job, voters ranked honesty and trustworthiness as their number one issue. The second most important issue? It was â€œcares about people like meâ€? ? another winning category for Sanders.\nThis will continue to plague Clinton throughout the primaries and, indeed, the general election. Itâ€™s not just the email scandal or her speeches at Goldman Sachs or flip flopping on key issues to Democrats like trade agreements. Itâ€™s an overwhelming feeling that Clinton operates in her own self interest as opposed to the good of the many and that she is, fundamentally, inauthentic.\nThat feeling appears to be overwhelming the electorate in many states.\nTo be sure, the states that Bernie Sanders is winning are largely white and tend to be more liberal. Clinton continues to consistently win African-American and Latino voters, two key voting blocs that will help her as the race moves to more diverse states again.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nBut in a campaign that has been so driven by momentum, Wisconsin certainly helps Sanders as he heads to New York. He already raised an astounding $44 million in March and will no doubt do the same in April. And though New York is Clintonâ€™s adopted home-state after serving as senator there, Sanders is making inroads. Heâ€™s now only 12 points behind Clinton when he was upwards of 40 points behind her just a few months ago.\nMomentum is the reason that the Sanders campaign is now talking about Clinton not getting the delegates she needs to win the nomination before the convention, and making the case to super-delegates that they should support him over her.\nHis team has been invoking 2008 when super-delegates left Clinton for Obama. That scenario was decidedly different in that Obama was the frontrunner for much of the race and Sanders will not be the frontrunner as we head into Philadelphia.\nBut Sanders will have a case if he manages to keep up this pace and pull off some bigger wins ? he needs larger margins to make a dent in her delegate count ? and therefore argue that the electorate is behind him; or at least behind him enough that they should think twice.\nThe odds of this scenario playing out are still quite unlikely. Tuesdayâ€™s win wonâ€™t seriously hurt Clinton as Wisconsin splits delegate proportionally. That said, an increasingly close race in New York, where a Sandersâ€™s rally at Washington Square Park is scheduled just five days before the primary, is certainly unsettling for the Clinton camp.\nWeâ€™ll say it again. It was never supposed to be this close.\nDouglas E. Schoen has served as a pollster for President Bill Clinton. He has more than 30 years experience as a pollster and political consultant.

Now, Bernie Sandersâ€™ campaign is ratcheting up predictions that Democrats, too, could have an open convention in July.\nThe odds remain stacked against the Vermont senator, no matter what his campaign says. And Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign is aggressively batting down talk of a Philadelphia free-for-all this summer.\nBut the Democratic underdogâ€™s recent winning streak ? bolstered Tuesday by a decisive victory in the Wisconsin primary ? has dashed for now Clintonâ€™s hopes of swiftly sewing up the nomination and pivoting to the general election, certainly not while the springtime cherry blossoms are still on the trees in Washington. The Sanders campâ€™s bold predictions speak to their hope that they can now drag out the race until July by blunting the front-runnerâ€™s pledged delegate gains.\nâ€œIt will be an open convention, likely with neither candidate having a majority of pledged delegates," Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN on Tuesday.\nThose predictions were met with a round of reality checks by team Clinton.\nCampaign manager Robby Mook blasted out a fundraising memo Tuesday night, as Sanders was rolling to victory in Wisconsin, saying Clintonâ€™s delegate lead â€œis nearly insurmountable.â€?\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nHe said the Sanders camp, in pushing for an open convention, is trying to â€œflip delegatesâ€™ votes, overturning the will of the voters.â€??\n?\n?\nThe big question is what specifically it would take for Clinton to avoid an open convention.\nThe complicating factor is the role played by â€œsuperdelegates,â€? party insiders free to support whomever they want. When those delegates and â€œpledgedâ€? delegates awarded via primaries and caucuses are added together, Clinton has a huge 1,748-1,058 delegate lead.\nShe would need to win just 635 of the remaining delegates ? roughly a third -- to get a majority of total delegates, or 2,383, before the convention. Given her record in the primaries so far, thatâ€™s hardly a heavy lift.\nBut when only pledged delegates are counted, Clintonâ€™s lead is narrower, at 1,279-1,027.\nDespite Weaverâ€™s comment, Clinton could easily win a majority of them with roughly 43 percent of the remaining pledged delegates.\nThe Sanders campaign, however, may be setting the bar much higher. If they argue Clinton must win 2,383 pledged delegates to clinch the nomination ? in other words, hit a majority of all delegates counting only pledged delegates ? she would need more than 60 percent of the remaining pledged field.\nDemocratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh said she thinks thatâ€™s what the Sanders campaign is saying.\nWhether the Democratic National Committee sees it the same way is unclear.\nAsked specifically what it would take to avoid an open convention, a DNC official reiterated that 2,383 represents the majority of all delegates, but would not speculate beyond that.\nThe Sanders campaign is not entirely clear, either, on how an open convention would emerge. ?\nSanders press secretary Symone D. Sanders told FoxNews.com the campaign is focused on simply winning states, predicting a strong showing in the Wyoming caucuses this weekend, before the race heads next to New York and other delegate-rich territory.\nâ€œThere is a path to the nomination for us,â€? she said, adding that they will go to Philadelphia but not elaborating on what exactly might trigger an open convention in their eyes.\nSo whatâ€™s the end-game?\nEven if Clintonâ€™s pledged delegate support is a little short, the former secretary of state still has hundreds of superdelegates on her side.\nWeaver noted to CNN that the superdelegates â€œdonâ€™t countâ€? until they vote at the convention. But unless the Sanders camp could somehow wrest away huge swaths of that support, the best case scenario for Sanders might be an open convention in name only ? where superdelegates put Clinton over the top as soon as the voting begins.\nâ€œSheâ€™ll use the superdelegates to finish it off if she doesnâ€™t hit that bar [with pledged delegates],â€? strategist Mary Anne Marsh said.\nShe, too, described Clintonâ€™s lead as â€œinsurmountable,â€? and played down the possibility of a contested convention.\nâ€œThis is more wishful thinking on the part of the Sanders campaign than anything based on facts or math,â€? she told FoxNews.com, while questioning whether Sanders might try to use his delegates as leverage to extract some wishlist item at the convention.\nMook said in a memo posted on Medium that â€œthe delegate math is on our side.â€? He noted that even among pledged delegates, Clinton has a sizeable lead, and the upcoming contests pose another challenge for Sanders.\nâ€œ[W]ith each passing week, itâ€™s becoming increasingly unlikely that Senator Sanders will be able to catch up. In order to do so, Sanders has to win the four remaining delegate-rich primaries ? New York, Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey ? with roughly 60 percent of the vote,â€? Mook said.\nClinton in the meantime is taking a tougher tone toward Sanders, even telling Politicoâ€™s Glenn Thrush sheâ€™s not sure heâ€™s a real Democrat.\nâ€œHeâ€™s a relatively new Democrat, and, in fact, Iâ€™m not even sure he is one,â€? she said. â€œHeâ€™s running as one.

See Latest Coverage â†’\nIt took the candidate a few days to grudgingly admit that his number was false. ?The question is why did he give such an inflated and easily checkable casualty figure--seven times higher than Hamaâ€™s own estimate?in the first place?\nIt is possible that Sanders, at 74, has a declining memory for facts.\nIt is more likely that he?like many other Jewish â€œprogressivesâ€??disapproves of Israel so strongly that even the most egregious slander against the Jewish State seems to him to be obviously true.\nSenator Sandersâ€™ unique solution to the Israeli-Palestinian impasse was equally jarring.\nThe Daily News: â€œYou've called not just for a halting construction of so-called settlements on the West Bank, but you've also called for pulling back settlements, just as Israel did in Gaza.? Describe the pullback you have in mind.â€?\nSanders responded with a cloud of clichÃ©s about peace and security for all.? But he didnâ€™t correct the Daily News premise that he was calling for a pullback â€œjust as Israel did in Gaza.â€?\nThat reference is to an Israeli government decision, carried out in the summer of 2005, to withdraw unilaterally from Gaza.? Troops were sent to 8500 Jewish settlers from Gaza and raze their villages. That ?action, which Israel took for its own strategic reasons, proved to be a serious military mistake. The self-governing Hamas mini-state that emerged has become a base of chronic terrorism and recurrent missile attacks on Israel like the one that precipitated the 2014 war.\nThe Daily News asked how far Sanders wanted the Israeli withdrawal to go this time.\nThe answer was: All the way.\nSanders: â€œI think if the [Israeli] expansion was illegal, moving into territory that was not their territory, I think withdrawal from those territories is appropriate.â€?\nDaily News:?â€œAnd who makes the call about illegality, in your mind?â€?\nSanders:?â€œWell, I think that's based on previous treaties and ideas. I happen to think that those expansions were illegal.â€?\nIt is unclear what treaties and ideas Senator Sanders happens to think should lead to an Israeli withdrawal. The U.N. and the Obama administration, view Israelâ€™s control of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which date back to the Six Day War, as illegal. The government of Israel does not.\nThis is a matter of opinion and Senator Sanders is entitled to his.? But his demand that the Gaza model be applied to East Jerusalem and the West Bank ignores reality. Approximately 800,000 Israelis live in these areas. No conceivable Israeli government could even contemplate sending in the army to expel them at gunpoint, or selling the public on a unilateral withdrawal. The army would rebel. And there would be a civil war that would inevitably affect the Palestinians as well. Bernie Sanders own version of Syria.\nThatâ€™s why not even the Palestinian Authority is demanding a reprise of Gaza.\nThe Daily News asked Senator Sanders what would happen if Israel happened to decline his modest plan. His answer came in the form of a threat. Israel is an independent nation, he said, it can do as it sees fit.? But if it wants a â€œpositive relationshipâ€? with the United States during the Sanders administration, it had better do what it is told.\nLater, a Sanders spokesman assured the press that Bernie is being misunderstood.? Bernie hostile to Israel? ?Bernie loves Israel.\nHey, he even lived on a kibbutz once for a few months.? Heâ€™s got a cousin there. Heâ€™s the first Jewish candidate for president, for Peteâ€™s sake!\nWell, of course he is. ?Only a Jewish candidate would have this kind of chutzpah.\nZev Chafets is a Fox News contributor.

Phil Bryant, right, walks past reporters on his way to a meeting of a youth jobs program board, at the Capitol in Jackson, Miss. (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.)\nMississippi Governor Phil Bryant signed a religious freedom law Tuesday that will protect people who believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.\nClick here to join Toddâ€™s American Dispatch - a must-read for Conservatives!\nThe Religious Freedom Law will â€œprotect sincerely held religious beliefs and moral convictions of individuals, organizations and private associations from discriminatory action by state government or its political subdivisions, which would include counties, cities, and institutions of higher learning.â€?\nIn other words, every Christian who owns a business in the state of Mississippi owes the governor a thank-you.\nâ€œThis bill merely reinforces the rights which currently exist to the exercise of religious freedom as stated in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,â€? Gov. Bryant wrote in a message posted on Twitter.\nFamily Research Council President Tony Perkins praised Gov. Bryant â€œfor standing up to the fundamental freedoms of the people they represent.â€?\nâ€œNo person should be punished by the government with crippling fines or face disqualification for simply believing what President Obama believed just a few years ago - that marriage is the union of a man and a woman,â€? Perkins said.?\nBefore the Supreme Court decided to redefine marriage President Obama assured the nation that those who opposed same-sex marriage had nothing to fear. He promised us that gay marriage would have no impact on our lives or our religion.\nThe presidentâ€™s assurances turned out to be woefully wrong.?\nIt has become clear in recent days that such protections are necessary. Militant LGBT activists and their supporters have waged a war on Christian business owners from coast to coast.\nTheyâ€™ve gone after grandmothers like Baronelle Stutzman, the owner of a Washington state flower shop who declined to participate in a gay wedding.\nTheyâ€™ve tried to silence and intimidate the owners of bakeries in Indiana, Colorado and Oregon.\nAnd most recently, the LGBT mob has gone after the owners of the Timbercreek Bed and Breakfast in Paxton, Ill.?\nJim and Beth Walder were fined $80,000 because they refused to hold a civil union ceremony for two homosexual men.?\nThanks to Gov. Bryant, Christian business owners will be free from such bullying and intimidation.?\nThe governor should be commended for his courage. He signed that legislation under the threat of an economic boycott.\nHollywood and Big Business are threatening to punish any states that defend the rights of Christians.?\nSome of the most egregious anti-Christian companies are Disney, Coca-Cola, and the National Football League.\nâ€œBig business and Hollywood have engaged in economic blackmail in Mississippi just like they have in Indiana, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas to try to force government discrimination of those who support natural marriage,â€? said Perkins.?\nThe threat is real.\nOscar-winning composer Stephen Schwartz just announced he will ban North Carolina theaters or any other organizations from performing his works. His decision comes after the state banned? transgender people from using the bathrooms of their choice.?\nMr. Schwartz is perhaps best known for creating the Broadway show â€œWicked.â€?\nPlaybill obtained a copy of an email he sent to fellow writers and producers urging them to join his boycott:\nâ€œI feel that it is very important that any state that passes such a law suffer economic and cultural consequences, partly because it is deserved and partly to discourage other states from following suit,â€? he wrote.?\nMr. Schwartz seems to believe that any state that refuses to let a man use the bathroom with a little girl should be punished. Wicked, indeed.\nGovernor Bryant did his part and now we must do ours -- by standing with lawmakers and corporations who defend the First Amendment and turning our backs on businesses that are enemies of religious liberty.\nTodd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.

Ted Cruz once again having the edge.\nWhile Donald Trump still holds a wide delegate lead in the GOP presidential primary race, his Achilles heel has been a perceived weakness in his ground game. Seeking to capitalize on this, Cruz has outmaneuvered Trump lately in the behind-the-scenes battle for delegates in places that don't assign them through traditional primaries or caucuses.?\nEnter states like North Dakota, and now Colorado.\nAll 13 of the delegates in play on Saturday have been pledged to Cruz.?This means that all of the delegates elected here today are committed to Cruz on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland. ?\nSeven "alternate" delegates each pledged themselves to Cruz and rival Trump.\nBoth North Dakota and Colorado eschewed traditional primary elections and instead held conventions -- where delegates not necessarily bound to any candidate are selected. Cruz saw this as an opportunity anyway to get allies elected to the slate, banking on their support in the event of an open convention.?\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.

Jeanne Zaino, professor of political science and international studies at Iona College, told FoxNews.com LIVE.\nTrump has been trying to beef up his team's delegate expertise, recently hiring convention veteran Paul Manafort to organize and implement his convention push.?\nWhile Trump is not scheduled to appear in Colorado,?the campaign recently replaced their state director, and their new operative on the ground, Patrick Davis, told Breitbart News they are?distributing Trump slates and "talking with convention delegates face to face [and] changing minds."\nBut Cruz will appear in person, while Ohio Gov. John Kasich has dispatched former New Hampshire Sen. John E. Sununu.\nâ€œWeâ€™ve seen very little sign of Donald Trump, and a lot more Kasich stickers than Donald Trump stickers,â€? Andrew Boucher, a chief convention strategist for John Kasich, told FoxNews.com.\nCruzâ€™s in-person appearance is part of a wider strategy to dominate the stateâ€™s nominating process. Colorado Republican operatives say that, just by winning the local gatherings, Cruz could lock down a majority of the 34 delegates up for grabs, even before Saturday's convention.\n"Cruz has the big upper hand here," Ryan Lynch, a Colorado-based Republican told The Associated Press. "They're the only ones really organized."\nAlthough the 34 delegates up for grabs may seem paltry compared with the 95 in New York and 172 in California -- both upcoming primary contests -- strategists point out that every delegate Cruz gets is one more step toward holding Trump under the necessary 1,237 delegates in the event of a contested convention.\nâ€œWhile Trump is leading in several upcoming states like New York and Pennsylvania, Cruz is pulling out all the stops with strategies to capture delegates in order to get to a contested convention,â€? Ron Bonjean, an unaffiliated Republican strategist, told FoxNews.com. â€œEvery delegate that is picked off in places like Colorado is a win for Cruz and makes it harder for Trump to be the nominee.â€??\nKasichâ€™s team is also taking a long-view approach, planting the seeds with unbound delegates that the Ohio governor could be the best choice at the convention in Cleveland in July.\nâ€œWe are actively reaching out them. We are planting the seeds,â€? Boucher said. â€œItâ€™s a long process.â€??\nTrump to date has 743 delegates, while Cruz has 520 and Kasich has 143.

Bernie Sanders on Saturday won the Wyoming Democratic caucuses to extend his winning streak, while Sen. Ted Cruz completed his sweep of Coloradoâ€™s 34 delegates.\nSanders had 56 percent of the vote, compared to 44 percent for primary frontrunner Hillary Clinton, with 96 percent of precincts reporting, according to the Associated Press, which called the race for Sanders.\nSanders got word of his Wyoming win from his wife, Jane, midway through a rally in Queens, part of a four-stop swing through New York City. A raucous cheer went up from the New Yorkers, but the Wyoming vote was a draw from a delegate perspective: Sanders and Clinton each picked up seven.\nSanders has won seven of the last eight contests. Wyoming had only 14 delegates at stake, but another victory would help Sanders fuel that narrative about his campaign having momentum and potentially upsetting Clinton in the New York primary on April 19.\nâ€œItâ€™s a beautiful state,â€? Sanders said at LaGuardia Community College, on the campaign trail in New York. â€œThank you Wyoming.â€?\nCruz locked up the 13 remaining delegates at Colorado's state convention, adding to the 21 that were pledged to him on Friday.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nâ€œToday was another resounding victory for conservatives, Republicans, and Americans who care about the future of our country. Utah, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and tonightâ€™s incredible results in Colorado have proven this: Republicans are uniting behind our campaign because they want a leader with real solutions who will bring back jobs, freedom, and security,â€? Cruz' campaign said in a statement following the delegate decision.\nCruz was the only GOP White House candidate to speak at the convention, though front-runner Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich each sent surrogates.\nâ€œWeâ€™ll see morning in America again,â€? Cruz told the convention crowd in a speech full of conservative touchtone like â€œreigning in the EPAâ€? and defeating â€œradical Islamic terrorists.â€?\nCruz on Friday won every assembly in the state's seven congressional districts, which began April 2 and culminated Friday.\nFollowing the Colorado results, the Associated Press count stands at Trump 743, Cruz 545, and John Kasich 143. Marco Rubio, who suspended his campaign, has 171 delegates. To clinch the nomination by the end of the primaries, a GOP candidate needs 1,237 delegates.\nOf Cruz's Colorado delegates before Saturday, only 17 were formally pledged to him. But they were all included on the senator's slates and are largely state party officials who said they were barred from signing a formal pledge for Cruz but have promised to back him in balloting at the convention.\nCruz's sweep increases the chances of a contested Republican convention this summer. Trump still has a narrow path to clinching the GOP nomination by the end of the primaries on June 7, but he has little room for error. He would need to win nearly 60 percent of all the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination before the convention. So far, he's winning 46 percent.\nThe complex Colorado process inherently favored Cruz, the Trump campaign charged, and suspicions among supporters mounted after the results were announced Saturday night. The official Colorado Republican Party account tweeted: "We did it! #NeverTrump." Colorado GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli said the tweet was unauthorized and it was swiftly deleted. The party was investigating who wrote the tweet.\nCruz supporters argued that their candidate didn't just have an organizational edge but that the Texas senator was a better fit with the state's socially conservative, libertarian-minded Republicans. "The Donald Trump caustic politics just doesn't resonate in Colorado," said Tom Peterson, an engineer and delegate from rural Elbert County.\nTrump supporters were frustrated by Colorado's arcane process, which involved a series of caucuses at different locations before the convention. "It doesn't seem like a real fair system," said George Rosel, 60, an engineer and Trump supporter who came to the convention from the Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch. "It seems kind of rigged."\nIn Wyoming, Democrats in 23 counties caucused. The 14 delegates that were up for grabs are among the stateâ€™s 18 that will go to the Democratic National Convention, also in July.\nâ€œOnce the inevitable frontrunner, Hillary Clinton has now lost her seventh straight contest," said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. "This embarrassing string of defeats to a 74-year old socialist from Vermont is another reminder of what a desperately flawed candidate she is, and how beatable she will be in November if she becomes the nominee."\nBefore Saturday, Clinton had 1,280 delegates compared to 1,030 for Sanders. And the count was 1,749-to-1,061 for Clinton when adding in super delegates. Either will need 2,383 delegates to win the nomination.\nThey both made stops Saturday in New York City, including Clinton at the famous Original Juniors restaurant in Brooklyn and Sanders at a diner in Long Island City and Bronx Community College.\nAt the college, Sanders essentially stuck to the major points of his campaign including calls for a more fair tax system. While he appeared to stop the recent attacks on Clinton, he did go after Trump.\nâ€œDonald Trump -- not that smart,â€? Sanders said. â€œThatâ€™s what demagogues like Donald Trump do. And don't give him too much credit. He didn't invent it. He's not that smart. They (are)? trying and divide us.â€?\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Obama said.â€? â€œNobody is above the law. How many times do I have to say it?â€?\nHis remarks came less than three months after White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest publicly downplayed a possible indictment for Clinton.\n?\nObama praised Clintonâ€™s tenure running the State Department from 2009 to 2013 and said he still doesnâ€™t think the emails to and from her private server breached national security.\nHowever, he acknowledged, as Clinton has done, that her using the private server was not a good idea, in part after revelations that roughly 2,000 of the emails included classified information.\nâ€œThereâ€™s carelessness in terms of managing emails, that she has owned, and she recognizes,â€? Obama told Fox News' Chris Wallace, in his first interview with the cable network since 2008.\nObama defended efforts to stop the growing international terror threat and his response to terrorists.\nâ€œMy No. 1 job is to protect the American people,â€? Obama said in the interview, taped Friday at the Unversity of Chicago Law School, where he was a professor. â€œMy No. 1 priority right now is defeating ISIL (the Islamic State.) â€¦ Iâ€™m the guy who calls the families, or meets with them, or hugs them, or tries to comfort a mom, or a dad, or a husband, or a kid, after a terrorist attack. So letâ€™s be very clear about how much I prioritize this: This is my No. 1 job.â€?\nObama also defended his actions after several deadly attacks, including playing a round of golf after American James Foley was beheaded and going to a baseball game in Cuba after the Brussels terror bombings last month, for which the Islamic State has claimed responsibility.\nâ€œIn the wake of terrorist attacks, it has been my view consistently?that the job of the terrorists, in their minds, is to induce panic, induce fear, get societies to change who they are," he said. "And what Iâ€™ve tried to communicate is, 'You canâ€™t change us. You can kill some of us, but we will hunt you down, and we will get you.'\nâ€œAnd in the meantime, just as we did in Boston, after the marathon bombing, weâ€™re going to go to a ballgame. And do all the other things that make our life worthwhile.? â€¦ Thatâ€™s the message of resilience. That we donâ€™t panic, that we donâ€™t fear, we will hunt you down and we will get you.â€?\nThe president also dug in on his position that the GOP-controlled Senate should vote on whether to confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland.\nHe argued lawmakers have a constitutional responsibility and suggested that Garland would pass the confirmation process.\nâ€œI think that if they go through the process, they wonâ€™t have a rationale to defeat him,â€? Obama said. ?\nThe president nevertheless acknowledged that congressional Republicans are in a tough election-year position, considering heâ€™s out of office in about nine months, with the possibility that the next president could be a Republican who will make his own nomination.\n?\n	foxnews	U.S.

Bernie Sanders appeared Sunday to downplay the upcoming New York primary as a must-win contest, amid his aggressive efforts to defeat front-runner Hillary Clinton in her adopted home state.\nâ€œAbsolutely we canâ€? win the nomination without winning New York, the Vermont senator and Brooklyn native told NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press.â€?? â€œI want to do as well as I can.â€?\nSanders made the comments just hours after the release of a Fox News poll that shows him trailing Clinton 37-to-53 percent among likely New York Democratic primary voters, with the primary on April 19.\nAnd he told ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€? that he and his campaign â€œwant to winâ€? New York and think they at least â€œgot a shot to win.â€?\nSanders is trying furiously to close Clintonâ€™s 1,756-to-1,058 delegate lead, with his campaign suggesting last week that it could do well enough in the remaining primaries to at least keep Clinton from winning the 2,383 delegates needed to secure the nomination and perhaps become the nominee in an open convention in July.\n(The only remaining caucus is for Democrats in North Dakota, on June 7.)\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nSanders' insurgent campaign has won eight of the last nine contests including the Wyoming Democratic caucuses on Saturday.\nSanders held four campaign events Saturday in New York City and one on Sunday, an outdoor rally on Coney Island in Brooklyn.\nThe Sanders and Clinton camps appear to have ended their heightened attacks on each otherâ€™s candidates in recent days, including suggestion that each is not qualified to be president.\nHowever, Sander continued to attack Clinton on Sunday in working class Brooklyn, tying her campaign to support from political action committees and Wall Street, just across the East River.\nâ€œChange never takes place from the top on down,â€? he said. â€œChange always takes place from the bottom up.â€? ?\nOn the Republican side, front-runner Donald Trump holds a big lead in New York over rivals Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, according to the new Fox News poll.\nTrump has 54 percent support from likely GOP primary voters, followed by ?Kasich with 22 percent and Cruz with 15 percent.\nThe billionaire businessman also leads in the overall delegate count with 743, followed by Cruz with 545 and Kasich with 143. A total 1,237 delegate are needed to secure the nomination before the July convention.\nâ€œWe will accumulate delegates, and we will go into the convention, we believe, with momentum,â€? Kasich told CBSâ€™ â€œFace the Nation.â€?\nThat Cruz is last in some New York poll is no surprise.\nIn a debate in January, Cruz accused Trump of having â€œNew York values,â€? which he sees as â€œsocially liberal or pro-abortion or pro?gay marriage [with a] focus around money and the media.â€?\nAfter Trumpâ€™s loss to Cruz on Tuesday in Wisconsin and a slow week of campaigning, Trump returned to the trail Sunday with a signature airplane hangar rally, in conservative leaning Rochester, N.Y. ?\nâ€œWe going to start winning again, let me tell you,â€? he told the crowd.\nTrump also argued the delegate-awarding process is a "crookedâ€? because he has won more states and voters than Cruz, who is picking up more delegates.\nâ€œWe need a system where voting means something,â€? he said.\nPaul Manafort, Trumpâ€™s newly-hired convention manager, said the campaign is now going head to head with Cruz in efforts to win delegate support at state and county levels.\nHowever, he expressed confidence that Trump will win enough delegates in the remaining primaries, which he argued makes delegate wrangling and related issues ahead of a possible contested convention more secondary. ?\nâ€œThat's the side game because the only game I'm focusing on right now is getting delegates,â€? Manafort told NBC. â€œAnd the games that have happened â€¦ are not important to the long-term game of how do we get to 1,237â€? delegates.\nClinton campaign chairman John Podesta was confident about Clinton winning in New York, where she was elected U.S. senator, and suggested Sandersâ€™ hot streak was coming to a close.\nâ€œLook, (Sanders) is competing vigorously here. So are we. But people in New York remember what a great job (Clinton) did for them.â€?\nPodesta argued Sanders' run was essentially in Western state caucuses and that the next six contests are East Coast primaries with more diverse electorates. ?\nâ€œWe think that when you get to bigger states, diverse states, primary states, we're going to do very well,â€? he said.\nFox Newsâ€™ Christopher Snyder contributed to this report from Rochester.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

As a journalist, I was fascinated by the political implications of the presidentâ€™s defense of his former secretary of state.? As a lawyer, I was stunned by his logic and reasoning which seemed, at times, tortured.? Here are my five takeaways from the conversation which aired on Sunday.?? ?\n1.? PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE BELIEVES HILLARY CLINTON â€œHAS NOT JEOPARDIZED AMERICAâ€™S NATIONAL SECURITY.â€? ?\nHow does he know?? He doesnâ€™t.? He was speculating.? Hackers may well have gained access to her unsecured serverâ€¦ and we simply donâ€™t know it.?\nHacking is often surreptitious.? ?Many victims donâ€™t even know it when theyâ€™ve been hacked.? The Chinese, Russians and other adversaries have a long history of hacking to obtain American secrets. ?Which is exactly why unsecured servers are a risk to national security.? So, Obamaâ€™s claim is baseless and without real knowledge.? No one, not even the president, knows every occasion when hackers succeed or fail.\n2.? OBAMA CLAIMED CLINTON â€œNEVER INTENTIONALLY PUT AMERICA IN ANY KIND OF JEOPARDY.â€? ?\nIn a court of law, that is not the issue. The question is not whether Clinton intended to put America at risk, but whether her actions were intentional and thereby put America at risk.?\nClintonâ€™s acts were clearly intentional.? She intended to create a private server.? She knew it was unsecured.? She intended to retain classified materials on the server, and she proceeded to do so (with some 2,000 classified and 22 â€œtop secretâ€? documents).\nRemember, knowingly storing classified information at an unauthorized location is a crime.? (18 USC 1924)\n3.? OBAMA DESCRIBED CLINTONâ€™S ACTIONS AS â€œCARELESS,â€? AS IF THAT MAKES IT OKAY.? ?\nIt is not okay under the law. ?Recklessness (or gross negligence) is sufficient to indict and convict, according to the statute and case law.? The presidentâ€™s use of the word â€œcarelessâ€? is simply a synonym for â€œrecklessâ€?.? While Obama was trying to exculpate Clinton, he was really inculpating or incriminating her by pronouncing her careless.? From a legal standpoint, he actually hurt Clintonâ€™s case.? ???\n4.? OBAMA INSISTED HE WILL EXERT â€œNO POLITICAL INFLUENCEâ€? ON THE FBI AND THE DOJ.?\nYet, he did precisely that in the interview!? He all but proclaimed Clintonâ€™s innocence by offering his opinion that she did nothing legally wrong (that is, his repeated description of â€œcareless, not intentionalâ€?).?\nObama was too clever by half.?\nPresidents are not supposed to interfere directly with pending cases.? So, what did Obama do?? He interfered indirectly.?\nAs president, he wields a huge megaphone.? He shouted his desire to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director James Comey in a nationally televised interview. Of course they saw it and/or read about it. They now know what he wants them to do.? The question isâ€¦will they do it?\n5.? CLINTONâ€™S DEFENSE IS NO DEFENSE AT ALL.\nShe claims some of her predecessors did the same thing. Incorrect.? None of them had their own private, unsecured servers in their homes on which they conducted their business exclusively.? Even if they did, Clintonâ€™s defense is the equivalent of saying, â€œitâ€™s okay to rob banks because other people do it.â€??\nShe also claims the materials were not â€œmarkedâ€? classified.? Thatâ€™s utterly irrelevant under the statute.? It is the content, not the markings, which make matters classified.? Indeed, it doesnâ€™t matter if they are marked or unmarked.?\nIf Clinton wants to claim she did not recognize the classified materials without the markings, then she would be arguing her own incompetence.?\nIn a court of law, incompetence is not a defense. ?\nGregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney.\nADVERTISEMENT\n	foxnews	U.S.

Media chide Bill Clinton for standing up to Black Lives Matter	2016-04-12 00:00:00	?\nThe pundits are having a field day beating up on Bill Clinton.\nHeâ€™s off message, they say. Heâ€™s lost it. Heâ€™s trapped in the past. Heâ€™s hurting her campaign.?\nHereâ€™s a contrary view: The former president did something the other day that his wife should do more of.\nHe was being heckled in Philadelphia by protestors from Black Lives Matter, and he decided to fight back.\nTerrible idea, many commentators said. His wife is trying to get African-American votes. Whatâ€™s he doing alienating a Democratic constituency group?\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nâ€œI wonder if thereâ€™s a part of Bill Clinton that doesn't really want Hillary Clinton to become president, particularly if she has to distance herself from his legacy to do so. How else to explain why one of the worldâ€™s most talented and agile politicians is so consistently flat-footed and destructive when advocating on his wifeâ€™s behalf?â€?\nWhat Clinton did was seize the moment, deliver an emotional response and tell a group of agitators something they didnâ€™t want to hear.\nThatâ€™s quite a contrast with the cautious candidate, whose public utterances seem so calculating and who rarely if ever challenges her supporters.\nFirst, the back story. In 1994, when violent crime was a major issue, Clinton pushed through legislation that imposed harsher sentencing guidelines and provided funding for more prisons and for more police officers on the street. This was popular at the time--but has since been blamed for an explosion in incarceration that is a liability in the 2016 Democratic primaries.\nHillary Clinton vowed to reverse many of these policies last year, saying it is â€œtime to end the era of mass incarceration.â€? And thatâ€™s fine: no reason she should be bound by what the 42nd president did more than two decades ago.\nHer husband went along, saying the crime bill was a compromise that cast â€œtoo wide a netâ€? and that â€œwe have too many people in prison.â€?\nEarlier this year, a black activist confronted Hillary about a comment she made about some hardened young criminals in 1996: â€œThey are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy, we can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.â€?\nClinton told the Washington Post after that meeting that she regretted having used those words.\nBut in Philadelphia last week, faced with such signs as â€œHillary is a murderer,â€? Bill Clinton angrily defended his wifeâ€™s 20-year-old characterization.\nâ€œI donâ€™t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didnâ€™tâ€¦You are defending the people who kill the people whose lives you say matter!â€?\nOf course, Clinton also defended his legislation for slashing the crime rate, so maybe he was getting defensive about his administrationâ€™s record.\nStill, it was a moment. Not unlike the Sister Souljah moment in 1992, when candidate Clinton took on a black rapper over her violent lyrics about killing white people.\nA day later, he must have been told his scolding of the protestors was not playing well. â€œI almost want to apologize for it,â€? he said. "I rather vigorously defended my wife, as I am wont to do, and I realized, finally, I was talking past [the protester] the way she was talking past me.â€?\nHillary Clinton endorsed that conciliatory language on CNN yesterday.\nItâ€™s true that 42 hasnâ€™t been a great asset for the woman he hopes will become 45. I saw them in New Hampshire and he appeared wan and low key, lacking the magic of old.\nBut whether you agree with the Clinton crime policies or not, what troubles me is the way most of the pundits saw his cardinal sin as going off script. Maybe he was right, maybe he was wrong. But sometimes itâ€™s worth going off script for something you believe in.\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

I was running on C.P. time." The phrase, popular in pop culture, is a reference to the stereotype that African-Americans are typically late for appointments.?\nBroadway actor Leslie Odom Jr., who was also on stage with Clinton and De Blasio and appeared to be in on the joke, said, "That's not - I don't like jokes about that, Bill."\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nClinton then turned to Odom and delivered the punch line, "Cautious Politician Time. I've been there."\nThe exchange takes place at the 8:30 mark of this video, posted on the NYC Mayor's Office YouTube channel.\n&nbsp;\nThe joke was widely criticized in the media, with New York magazine calling it "amazingly unfunny, terribly executed". Left-leaning website Salon called it "cringeworthy", as did The Root , which bills itself as a site for "Black News, Opinion, Politics, and Culture."\nThe skit came at an awkward time for Clinton, who has ridden strong African-American support to several wins in key primary states but has also been criticized by some for using the term "superpredator" during her husband's administration to describe criminals.\nLast week, former President Bill Clinton clashed with Black Lives Matter activist and defending his criminal justice policies at an appearance in Pennsylvania. Hours before her Inner Circle appearance, Hillary Clinton told the New York Daily News that she also agreed with critics who say the bill contributed to high levels of incarceration for non-violent crimes, like drug offenses.\nDe Blasio told CNN Monday evening that critics of the skit were "missing the point."\nIt was clearly a staged show. It was a scripted show and the whole idea was to do the counter intuitive and say 'cautious politician time,'" he said. "Every actor involved, including Hillary Clinton and Leslie Odom Jr., thought it was a joke on a different convention."\nA Clinton spokesman said in a statement to ABC News, "We agree with the mayor."\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

She would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.â€?\nTed Cruz stepping up the pressure on Trump over delegates.\nThe Washington Post writing today:\nDonald Trump used his first campaign rally in western New York to attack Sen. Ted Cruz for something the Texan happily boasts about: mastering party rules to elect his delegate slates to the Republican National Convention.\n"They're trying to subvert the movement," Trump said to thousands of voters crammed into a frigid airplane hangar Sunday. "They can't do it with bodies, so they're trying to subvert the movement with crooked shenanigans."\nThe Rochester rally was only Trump's second in the 14-day New York campaign, and his first since Cruz swept Colorado's 34 available delegates in a series of conventions. Trump's hastily assembled delegate-chasing operation, which had been optimistic about the state, bumbled through a series of votes and came out empty there.\nThe Wall Street Journal writing today:\nâ€œThe party conventions across the country typically get little national attention. But while Mr. Trump has recently reorganized and beefed up his campaign staff to focus on them, the scramble is an insiderâ€™s contest that plays to one of Mr. Cruzâ€™s strengths: his ties with seasoned political activists. They turned out in force in Colorado, where he dominated the stateâ€™s raucous and chaotic convention system and picked up all 34 delegates available. They also delivered in Iowa, where Republicans on Saturday?more than two months after the state held its caucus for voters?began the process of picking delegates to the July national convention. Cruz supporters won 11 of the 12 that were up for grabs in Iowa.â€?\nThe New York Times today writes about the intriguing possibility of Paul Ryan running for President:\nâ€œWhile Mr. Ryan has repeatedly said that he has no intention of becoming his partyâ€™s nominee this year, he is already deep into his own parallel national operation to counter Donald J. Trump and help House and Senate candidates navigate the political headwinds that Mr. Trump would generate as the partyâ€™s standard-bearer ? or, for that matter, Senator Ted Cruz, who is only slightly more popular.

Bill Clinton doesn't owe anyone an apology	2016-04-13 00:00:00	?\nBill Clinton owes no one an apology or even an â€œalmostâ€? apology.\nIn one of the purest moments Iâ€™ve seen this campaign season, Bill Clinton set the record straight on his controversial 1994 crime bill and the politics of the Black Lives Matter movement in a Philadelphia speech.\nIn a clash that has now gone viral, Clinton called out a young protestor ?not formally affiliated with BLM but a supporter of the movement ? for criticizing Hillary Clintonâ€™s support for his anti-crime policies in the 1990s. This has been an issue for Hillary throughout the campaign, as she has been regularly confronted over the 1994 Crime bill?supported by then-Congressman Bernie Sanders, for what itâ€™s worth?which many argue led to putting generations of black men behind bars. Under pressure from the progressive left and the BLM movement, she apologized in February for having used the term â€œsuper predatorsâ€? in a 1996 speech.\nBill Clinton showed us why Hillary shouldnâ€™t have apologized in the first place. Her retraction was pure pandering and highlighted just how often politics and the need to pacify specific factions ? in this case, BLM ? has affected our national discourse.\nAnyone who knows Hillary Clinton or what the crime bill was about knows that she wasnâ€™t talking about black youths generally when she used the term â€œsuper predator.â€? She was talking about drug dealers and gang leaders. As Bill Clinton put it in Philadelphia, â€œI donâ€™t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out into the streets to murder other African-American children.â€?\nSounds like â€œsuper predatorsâ€? to me. And anyone reading it any differently doesnâ€™t want to confront the realities of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when national murders topped 23,000 for five years straight.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nThe 1994 Crime bill worked. That doesnâ€™t mean that it was perfect. The law has arguably led to overly aggressive policing tactics in some communities and extended prison sentencing. But the measure accomplished most of what it set out to do in reducing homicides, putting more cops on the street, banning semi-automatic assault weapons, and addressing gang violence.\nYou wouldnâ€™t know it today, but the bill actually reduced sentencing for federal drug crimes through an exemption for non-violent first time offenders. It invested money in drug courts, which both Republicans and Democrats agree should be more widely used as alternatives to prison. And it spent upward of $3 billion ensuring that at-risk youth stay away from gangs.\nThe results were clear: within a year after the Crime billâ€™s passage, the homicide rate went down by 10 percent and continued to drop. Indeed, by 2000, the murder rate had dropped an astounding 40 percent from its peak. Someone will need to explain to me how these results could be considered a bad thing.\nThose who claim that the crime bill locked up generations of black men who were low-level drug offenders must simply confront the empirical reality.\nAs Heather MacDonald of the Manhattan Institute writes, â€œThe state-prison population (which accounts for 87 percent of the nationâ€™s prisoners) is dominated by violent criminals and serial thieves. In 2013 drug offenders made up less than 16 percent of the state-prison population; violent felons were 54 percent and property offenders 19 percent...in federal prisons [drug offenders] arenâ€™t casual drug users; overwhelmingly, they are serious traffickers. Fewer than 1 percent of drug offenders sentenced in federal court in 2014 were convicted of simple drug possession, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.â€?\nThatâ€™s not the picture Black Lives Matter?or even President Obama?has been painting of crime and punishment.? With the left peddling this distorted reality, itâ€™s no surprise that Hillary was under huge pressure to apologize, or that Bill wound up offering an â€œalmostâ€? apology.\nBoth should have hung tough and stood up for the truth. The black community backed the 1994 crime bill. And both Clintons support sensible criminal justice reform today. Politics shouldnâ€™t be about capitulation. It should be about results. The Crime bill produced results for America that both Clintons were proud of back then. If anything, they should be even more proud, two decades later.\nDouglas E.

Ted Cruz to paint the billionaire businessman as too closely tied to the Clinton family ? as Hillary Clinton leads the 2016 primary race on the Democratic side. Trump previously has brushed off the criticism, saying he had contact with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and countless other powerful people, because as a businessman he had to get along with everybody.\nThe newly released files shed light on that relationship.\nOne document is a photocopy of his best-selling book, â€œThe Art of the Deal,â€? sent to Bill Clinton aide Mark Middleton. An autographed page says â€œTo Mark ? Best Wishes,â€? and adds, â€œYour Mom Is The Best.â€?\nAnother is a 1993 invitation to President Clinton, though not from Trump himself, to join a charity event in Atlantic City where Trump was slated to attend.\n?\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.

And another set of database entries appears to reflect a handful of White House events attended by Trump in 1995.?\nThe documents were among nearly 500 pages of files -- pertaining to the Clinton White Houseâ€™s communications regarding Trump and the Trump Organization ? that were released by the National Archives and published by the Clinton library, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.\nThe Clintons and the Obama White House were notified back in January by the National Archives that the files would be released in April, unless President Obama or former President Bill Clinton requested a one-time extension or tried to assert a â€œprivilegeâ€? to keep some documents private. While the Clinton library houses the records, the National Archives and Records Administration reviews and rules on requests to release such presidential documents.\nThe National Archives said they had reviewed a batch of several FOIA requests, for which they planned to release more than 9,000 pages. Regarding the Trump files request, the record-keepers said just three pages would be restricted.\nThe FOIA request itself came from BuzzFeed, an archivist told FoxNews.com.?\nThe documents released Tuesday also reflect the Clinton White Houseâ€™s interest in Trumpâ€™s flirtation back in 1999 and 2000 with a third-party presidential run.\nOne internal White House email in early 2000 among staff notes that Trump â€œhas his eye on the big JOB.â€?

Um, would you believe â€˜meow?â€™\nTRUMP HELPS HILLARY SURVIVE A ROCKY YEAR\nToday is the one-year anniversary of the official start of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign, which she launched with a brief online video .\nIt was a revealing choice, as was her subsequent trip to Iowa in a blacked-out â€œ Scooby van ,â€? including the seemingly furtive visit to an Ohio fast-food restaurant.\nKeeping the candidate in the campaign equivalent of a hamster ball may have been about her teamâ€™s desire for a cloistered Clinton and an avoidance of the sloppy mistakes of her first presidential run. But there was also a bigger consideration.\nClinton, who had unmistakably been preparing for a second run since the moment of her 2008 defeat, had toyed with the idea of a Jeb-esque protracted phony campaign, delaying the official launch ? and official fundraising rules ? until as late as July of last year.\nBut March blew a chill wind into Clintonâ€™s plan for conquest when it was revealed that the former secretary of state had engaged in some very dreggy electronic hygiene. Her efforts to put the matter to rest went, um, poorly .\nThe once and future frontrunner had a problem. She couldnâ€™t announce her run in the teeth of a scandalous gale, but neither could she afford to create any doubts in her party that she might be backing out because of her email woes. A viable rival might emerge. So she tried an announcement version of a â€œmodified limited hang out.â€?\nIt was not a hit, but it did achieve its apparent goals of crossing the legal threshold of candidacy while insulating the candidate from scrutiny and those pesky reporters. Team Clinton would try a do-over in June on New Yorkâ€™s Roosevelt Island, but that only reinforced the thickness of the membrane around the candidate and campaign.\nOne year ago today, Clinton was broadly disliked, with real ethical concerns from her time as secretary of state and the proprietor of a heavy-handed and airless campaign. And she also looked quite inevitable.\nAnd nothing seems to have changedâ€¦\nDespite more scandals over the course of the year involving the Clintonâ€™s money-making machine , Benghazi , and the discovery of classified information on a private server , Clinton still remains the unquestionable Democratic frontrunner. Sen. Bernie Sanders still doesnâ€™t have a path to victory that doesnâ€™t involve the mass defection of his partyâ€™s leadership.\nBut if we look a bit closer, some things have changed for Clinton.\nAt this time last year, Republicans were eagerly ticking off the days until the general election. With a strong primary field of contenders and another batch of Clinton scandals looming, the GOP figured Clinton would be easier to beat than they had once anticipated.\nThe debate among Republicans wasnâ€™t whether Clinton could be beaten, but rather about with whom they would trounce her. The reformist Midwestern governor? The charismatic Cuban-American senator? The time-tested scion of the old guard?\nNope .\nTwo months after Clintonâ€™s Scooby adventure, her fellow New Yorker and erstwhile friend Donald Trump declared his own candidacy on the GOP side. And what started out as a punch line or the threat of a third-party run would go on to take the dominant position in every national GOP primary poll by the end of the summer.\nThe words written about how and why Trump managed to eat the GOP nominating process are so numerous that their pixels might overwhelm even the data vaults at the NSA. The tyranny of multiplicity ? The dislocation of millions of Americans by technological change? The ripeness of the issue of illegal immigration? And the failure of the existing Republican order to deliver on lavish promises? Yep, yep, yep and yep.\nBut whatever the reasons for his rise, Trump has been a boon to Clinton. Here weâ€™re not talking about surveys on the still-far-off general election that show Trump going down in a Hoover-sized landslide.\nThe immediate benefits to Clinton of Trumpism are that what should have been a damaging primary-election season has been substantially ignored. Rather than talking about Clinton scandals, restive liberals, Clintonâ€™s record or anything else, she has mostly been able to roll along in her Habitrail.\nWho wants to talk about that dusty old server when youâ€™ve got an outrage industry banking the furnaces of umbrage until they are white hot? And that means further opportunity for Clinton, who can jump in the news cycle from time to time by flaying Trump and his party.\nTrump even takes the heat off of Clinton on the Democratâ€™s undemocratic nominating process. Clintonâ€™s party is far more controlling than Republicans when it comes to the actual seating of delegates, but Sandersâ€™ complaints are buried under a pile of Trump accusations of corruption, illegality and misconduct.\nTrumpâ€™s supporters may be right that in the general election, he will break her down like a church table after a picnic. But so far, he has been the best part of her very rough year.\n[Pro-GOP group America Rising is taking a victory lap for getting more than 1 million views with its online clip of Clintonâ€™s troubles navigating the New York subway system.]\nBernie takes a hard line on fracking, knocks Hillary - NYT : â€œBernie Sanders, campaigning across New York State on Monday, called for a nationwide ban on fracking and pointedly criticized Hillary Clinton for her record and stances on environmental issues. The Vermont senator began his day speaking to an estimated 5,000 people in Binghamton and by releasing a new television ad that called for the end of fracking across the country. Mr. Sanders said Mrs. Clinton has advocated for natural gas pipelines that will hurt the environment, and that as secretary of state she had rewarded companies through fracking expansions.â€?\nDudeâ€¦ - The Hill : â€œHillary Clinton?performed in a racially tinged skit at an annual New York City press dinner â€¦ Clinton took the stage for?a surprise appearance?at Saturdayâ€™s Inner Circle Dinner?and proceeded to needle Mayor Bill de Blasio for his belated endorsement. â€˜I just have to say thanks for the endorsement, Bill. Took you long enough,â€™ Clinton told her former campaign manager. â€˜Sorry, Hillary, I was running on C.P. time,â€™ de Blasio replied to gasps from the crowd. As Raw Story?explains, â€˜C. P. time,â€™ or â€˜colored people time,â€™ refers to â€˜the stereotype that African Americans generally tell as a reason for being late to an event or a traditionally black event not beginning on time.â€™â€?\n[Dem delegate count: Clinton 1756; Sanders 1068 (2,383 needed to win)]\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEEâ€¦\nOn this date in 1861, the first shot was fired on Fort Sumter beginning the bloodiest four-years in American history. The Civil War Trust brings us the story of the man who fired that fateful shot: â€œAlthough some popular legends have attributed that iconic shell to the militant Virginia secessionist Edmund Ruffin, the distinction actually fell to Capt. George S. James of the South Carolina Artilleryâ€¦Initially, he served as an aide to Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, bringing messages to the Union contingent inside Fort Sumter. As the situation worsened, the Southerners began to make plans for the attack on the fort. The honor of firing the first shot was initially given to Virginia congressman Roger Pryor. But at the 11th hour, Pryor demurred, and military veteran James volunteered for the jobâ€¦He was killed while leading the battalion at Foxâ€™s Gap on September 14, 1862.â€?\nGot?a?TIP?from the?RIGHT?or the?LEFT?

Since the outset of the race, Clinton has had the inside track with them.\nBut those insiders are coming under heavy pressure to reconsider.\nOne anti-Clinton activist recently set up what he called the Superdelegate Hit List, a website housing contact information for the influential delegates ? he later renamed it the Superdelegate List after complaints, but is still encouraging people to â€œfindâ€? these officials and â€œhold them accountable to our votes.â€?\nBob Mulholland, a longtime member of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton superdelegate, also recently published an open letter saying heâ€™s heard complaints from colleagues about â€œgetting harassing emails, Facebook postings and phone callsâ€? demanding they support Sanders.\nThe Sanders camp is openly courting superdelegates but denies involvement in these outside efforts and says they are not encouraging aggressive tactics.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\n"We want people to be courteous and respectful in dealing with anyone," said Tad Devine, a senior Sanders adviser.\nThe alleged arm-twisting, though, reflects broader frustration among Sanders supporters and others with the partyâ€™s delegate process. A similar situation is playing out on the Republican side, where Texas Sen. Ted Cruz lately has proved better at navigating the behind-the-scenes battle for delegates than front-runner Donald Trump, even though Trump has won more primary and caucus contests. The billionaire businessman, who maintains a significant delegate lead, has lashed out at party leaders, calling the process â€œriggedâ€? against him.\nOn both sides, the complaints center around the ability of â€˜unboundâ€™ delegates to support any candidate, regardless of how voters cast their ballots. On the Democratic side, Sanders supporters have been angered by the ability of superdelegates to give Clinton an even bigger lead.\nCounting those insiders, Clintonâ€™s lead is nearly 700 delegates. But if one counts only the pledged delegates, Clintonâ€™s lead shrinks to just 251.\nStill, itâ€™s unclear whether any sizeable number of Clinton superdelegates would consider switching. One high-profile lawmaker in Clintonâ€™s corner, Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., said thereâ€™s no way heâ€™ll abandon her.\nâ€œThere is nothing that Bernie Sanders can do that would make me switch sides. I have an obligation as a superdelegate, number one, to reflect the will of the people in my congressional district â€¦ and, number two, to reflect my own priorities,â€? he told Fox News.?\nDelegates Awarded to Democratic Candidates | InsideGov\nSandersâ€™ argument about having â€œmomentumâ€? has been bolstered after winning seven of the last eight state contests, most recently in Wyoming. But the map could soon be turning once again in Clintonâ€™s favor, as New York and other states prepare to vote.\nClintonâ€™s team also has flipped the script on Sanders supporters, accusing them of â€œrigging the system.â€? Spokesman Brian Fallon told CNN that Clinton is winning the popular vote, and what Sanders is trying to do is â€œflipâ€? superdelegates and â€œoverturn the will of the people.â€?\nSanders campaign officials said late last month that theyâ€™re courting superdelegates but described those who are undecided ? as opposed to those backing Clinton ? as the best targets.\nSpencer Thayer, the activist who created the online database of superdelegate contact information, told The Washington Post his site is not affiliated with the Sanders campaign, though he described the Vermont senator as â€œirrefutably a better candidate than Hillary Clinton.â€?\nThe websiteâ€™s home page asks â€œconcerned votersâ€? to submit superdelegate contact information. A work-in-progress online spreadsheet includes phone numbers, addresses, email addresses and other information on them.\nIn launching the site, Thayer declared on Twitter that itâ€™s aimed at â€œharassingâ€? superdelegates.\nSpeaking to the Post, he pushed back on the criticism heâ€™s faced. "Historically, the superdelegates have been able to disenfranchise voters without being held accountable," he told the Post. "The Internet has changed power relationships between party leaders and their constituents, and those in power have a tendency to interpret challenges to their authority as harassment."\nFox Newsâ€™ Peter Doocy and The Associated Press contributed to this report.?\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.
418462	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/04/14/gregg-jarrett-florida-got-it-right-why-trumps-campaign-manager-should-not-be-prosecuted.html	Gregg Jarrett: Florida got it right. Why Trump's campaign manager should not be prosecuted	2016-04-15 00:00:00	Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print\n?\nIt was the right decision.? A â€œno-brainer.â€? A Florida State Attorney announced Thursday that he would not prosecute the criminal case against Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, for grabbing the arm of a reporter.?\nIt makes perfect sense.? Misdemeanor battery is the intentional touching of someone against their will or harming someone.? Technically, Lewandowski committed a battery.? But there are degrees of offensive touching and harm.? Some are major, others are minor.? It was clear the prosecutor felt this was a minor incident which, under inflamed political circumstances, had been blown out of proportion.?Go figure.\nThe surveillance video of the encounter is instructive.? In fact, it is the star witness. ?Lewandowski clearly grabs the arm of the reporter, Michelle Fields.? He pulls her away from Trump.? Was it done forcefully?? It appears so.? But did he throw her to the ground or do something other than restrain her?? It doesnâ€™t look that way.? If prosecutors were to bring to trial every instance in which peopleâ€™s arms are grabbed, courts would be clogged like a Los Angeles freeway.\nThe physical harm is also a consideration.? How injured was the alleged victim?? The State Attorney confirmed there were bruises in the form of finger imprints.? Thatâ€™s it.? No broken bones or sprained wrists.? No head injury.? No blood.? Just a couple of faint bruises.? Some people bruise easily, and the defense would surely bring this up.? But on balance, was Fields really hurt?? Enough to spend taxpayer resources in bringing a criminal case to trial?? In making a decision, prosecutors must use their common sense.? In this case, they did.???? ??\nA Viable Defense\nThe State Attorney was persuaded that Lewandowski was trying to protect Trump.? It is a good and viable defense.? Similar to self-defense, the law allows the accused to claim â€œdefense of anotherâ€? to excuse his otherwise criminal conduct.? A good prosecutor will examine the totality of the circumstances.? That is, why did it happen?? What events led to the physical touching?? In a phone call to the State Attorney, Trump said his campaign manager was trying to protect him from an overly-aggressive reporter who was getting too physically close to him.? One Secret Service agent confirmed that Fields touched Trump before Lewandowski pulled her away. ?The video proves both accounts.? Cameras donâ€™t lie.? They are more reliable than most fallible and biased eyewitnesses.\nThe legal standard for defending someone else is defined by one word: â€œreasonableness.â€?? Was it reasonable for Lewandowski to fear for the safety of Trump?? Maybe.? But maybe is good enough in a court of law.? Remember, prosecutors must prove their case beyond a reasonable doubtâ€¦which is an extremely high burden. ?Maybe is enough to cast doubt on the merits of the stateâ€™s case.?\nBeyond that, the accused could also avail himself of whatâ€™s called â€œimperfect defense of another.â€? What is it??An honest but mistaken belief that someone is about to be harmed. ?It is known in legal circles as the â€œoops defense.â€??\nLyle and Erik Menendez employed a comparable ?â€œimperfect self-defenseâ€? during their double murder trial.? They claimed they killed their parents because they genuinely believed mom and dad were going to harm them. ?At trial, the brothers acknowledged they were probably mistaken in that belief.? â€œOopsâ€¦sorry mom and dad!â€?? Of course, it was a preposterous claim and they are now serving life sentences.? But Lewandowski could have employed successfully a similar defense in arguing that, perhaps, he overreacted or misjudged the situation. ?He made a mistake. ?The â€œoops defenseâ€? gives him a legal out. ??\nIf Fields feels aggrieved, she has only herself to blame.? At least thatâ€™s the view of the State Attorney.? He seemed highly critical of the reporter for defying instructions to move to the back of the ballroom.? Instead, she worked her way forward and wove through a phalanx of Secret Service agents, reached Trump and touched his arm.? Again, it is depicted on the videotape.? Trump, according to the prosecutor, recoiled.? At that point, his campaign manager intervened to pull Fields away.\nWhy would police charge Lewandowski, only to have the prosecutor decline to bring the case to trial?? The answer is fairly simple. ?Police have a lower legal standard of â€œprobable causeâ€? in deciding to charge someone with an offense.? For prosecutors, the standard is much higher.? They must decide whether they can win the case at trial.? How will jurors react to these facts?? If public opinion is any barometer, it would have been extremely difficult for the state to convince unanimously 12 jurors beyond a reasonable doubt.? Prosecutors hate to lose cases, which is why they only prosecute â€œwinners.â€? And even then, they donâ€™t always win.\nA Defamation Case\nFields can still sue Lewandowski for defamation. ?She would have a fairly strong case against him because the standard of proof for the plaintiff is lower in a civil lawsuit for money damages ?a preponderance of the evidence.? In plain terms, it means sheâ€™d have to prove her case by the greater weight of the evidence. ?That is a lot easier than the criminal burden.\nSo, how was Fields allegedly defamed?? After their interaction, Lewandowski called her â€œdelusionalâ€? and insisted he never touched her.? In essence, he was calling Fields a liar.? But the videotape belies his statement.? He seems like the liar.? He is seen grabbing her and pulling her away.? Defamation is a false statement which damages someoneâ€™s good name and reputation.? Has Fields been damaged?? Judging from the social media commentary and her precipitous job departure, Iâ€™d say yes.? Her damages could be considerable.? ??\nThere is one more twist to a defamation case.? So-called â€œpublic figuresâ€? have an extra burden in court.?They must prove â€œmalice.â€?? In other words, they must demonstrate the defendant knew his statements were false.?It is debatable whether Fields would be regarded as a â€œpublic figureâ€? but it doesnâ€™t matter.? Again, the videotape takes care of that.?Lewandowski knew he grabbed her.?Heâ€™s shown doing it on the video.? It was foolish for him to pretend otherwise.? But itâ€™s always the cover-up, not the crime...? ??\nOf course, Lewandowski might try to claim amnesia.? Itâ€™s a common affliction among politicians and their sycophants.\nGregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney.\nADVERTISEMENT\n	foxnews	U.S.

Obama's take on Hillary Clinton's emails is hard to figure out	2016-04-15 00:00:00	Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print\n?\nPresident Barack Obamaâ€™s recent remarks to my Fox News colleague Chris Wallace about Hillary Clintonâ€™s email issues were either Machiavellian or dumb. It is difficult to tell from them whether he wants the mountain of evidence of her criminal behavior presented to a federal grand jury or he wants her to succeed him in the White House.\nHe cannot have both.\nHis efforts to minimize his former secretary of state's diversion of emails from government-secured servers to her own non-secure home server by calling it â€œcarelessâ€? may actually harm her in the eyes of the public or even serve as a dog whistle to the FBI. Thatâ€™s because carelessness is a species of negligence, and espionage, which is the failure to safeguard state secrets by removing them from their proper place of custody, is the rare federal crime that can be proved by negligence -- to be precise, gross negligence.\nGross negligence is the failure to perform a high legal duty with the great probability of an improper result -- for example, driving a car 90 miles per hour in New York's Times Square. The high legal duty Clinton had was to safeguard state secrets; the improper result is the exposure of those secrets contained in her emails.\nWhat did she do that was criminal, and who was harmed by her behavior?\nClinton knowingly diverted all of her governmental emails from secure government servers to her own non-secure server in her New York residence. Among the 60,000 emails she diverted were 2,200 that contained state secrets. Because the essence of espionage is the removal of secrets to non-secure venues, the crime is complete upon removal. So Obamaâ€™s statement in the Wallace interview that Clinton caused no harm is irrelevant. In espionage cases, the government need not prove that the defendant caused any harm.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.

The evidence is well-grounded, as some of the secrets were too grave for the FBI to review and all came from her own server. And the evidence is sufficient to indict and to convict because it was obtained legally and shows a four-year pattern of regular, consistent, systematic violation of the laws requiring safeguarding.\nObamaâ€™s suggestion that some secrets were not really secret is also irrelevant, because Clinton, like the president, swore to recognize secrets and to keep them secret, no matter her opinion of them.\nThe FBI knows this and is taking it far more seriously than the president or Clinton.\nJust last week, the team investigating Clinton sought and received the extradition to the U.S. of a man who was imprisoned in Romania for computer hacking. One of those he hacked is Clintonâ€™s confidant Sid Blumenthal, to whom she sent many emails containing state secrets. What will the hacker tell the feds he saw?\nClintonâ€™s surrogates began taking her legal plight seriously in the past few weeks by arguing that her behavior was no different from that of other former high-ranking executive branch officials who occasionally and accidentally took top-secret documents home or discussed top-secret information in non-secure emails and that the consequences for them were tepid or nonexistent.\nYet there is no comparison between these occasional lapses and the planned and paid-for four-year diversion of secrets that Clinton orchestrated. Moreover, there is no instance of unprosecuted behavior that her supporters can cite that involves the sheer volume and regularity of the failure to safeguard that we see here.\nThough the government need not prove intent, there is substantial evidence of Clintonâ€™s intent to commit espionage from three sources. One is Clintonâ€™s email instructing an aide to remove the â€œsecretâ€? designation from a document and send it to her from one non-secure fax machine to another. The second is the Blumenthal hacking incidents, which occurred during her tenure as secretary of state and which did not stop her from emailing him from her home server. The third is a federal rule that permits the inference of intent from a pattern of bad behavior, of which there is ample evidence in this case.\nOn the same weekend that the president was damning Clinton with faint praise and cynically offering what he must have known were irrelevant legal defenses, Clinton continued her pattern of persistent public laughing about and dismissing the significance of the FBI investigation of her.\nThat attitude -- which is recorded and documented by the FBI -- must have caused many of those investigating her to conclude that she understands the predicament she is in but is minimizing it. Or she may be a congenital liar who is lying to herself. Either way, they await with eager anticipation their interrogation of her, should she foolishly submit to one.\nAndrew P.

Sanders said, noting Clinton previously has pushed for increasing the hourly wage to $12. â€œI think the secretary has confused a lot of people.â€?\nHowever, Clinton said while she supports the goal of raising the wage to $12, she would sign legislation raising it to $15 if a Democratic Congress passes it.\nâ€œI have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for 15,â€? Clinton insisted.\nThe heated dispute, in which the candidates frequently interrupted each other, was one of many at a CNN-hosted debate heavy on populist rhetoric ? and personal attacks.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nSanders at one point went as far as to suggest Clintonâ€™s labeling of certain criminals as "superpredators" when she was first lady was "a racist term and everybody knew it was a racist term."\nThe two faced off in Brooklyn, for their first debate in more than a month, at a critical time. The campaign heads soon into the final stretch with the upcoming New York primary seen as a determining factor. While Sanders trails badly in delegates, he is pointing to his recent winning streak in insisting he can still â€œwin this nomination.â€?\nâ€œSecretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the deep South. We got murdered there,â€? he conceded, before adding. â€œWeâ€™re out of the deep South now.â€?\nâ€œIâ€™m not taking anything for granted, or any voter or any place,â€? Clinton said, while noting sheâ€™s gotten millions more votes and saying the party will eventually have to unite.\nEyeing the contest ahead, both candidates courted Empire State voters Thursday by stressing their New York ties ? and more broadly, hitting working-class themes.\nAt the same time, the debate veered heavily into foreign policy in the second half, with Sanders using the issue to challenge Clintonâ€™s judgment while she questioned his experience.\nâ€œDescribing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it,â€? Clinton said at one point, challenging Sanders as he laid out his goals for achieving Middle East peace.\nSanders also took heat from Clinton for describing Israeli military action as at times disproportionate. â€œThey do not invite rockets raining down on their towns and villages,â€? she said. Sanders said Israel has a right to defend itself, but the U.S. needs to be even-handed in peace talks.\nSanders, as he has before, hammered Clinton for supporting regime change in Libya and Iraq, warning that it has â€œunintended consequences.â€? He said the former secretary of stateâ€™s continued support for a no-fly zone in Syria ? which he noted President Obama does not support ? â€œruns the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.â€?\nBut Clinton defended her stance, and argued: â€œNobody stood up to Assad and removed him and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria.â€?\nEarlier, Sanders also pointed to Clintonâ€™s support for the Iraq war, as well as â€œvirtually every disastrous trade agreement,â€? in challenging her â€œjudgmentâ€? to lead.\nHowever, Clinton fired back, pointing to an editorial board meeting Sanders had with the New York Daily News where he seemed to struggle to explain his plan to break up the banks and various foreign policy positions.\nâ€œHe could not explain howâ€? he would break up the banks, Clinton said. She defended her own judgment and said: â€œI think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.â€?\nWhile the tone was tougher than past face-offs, the candidates hit several familiar themes. Clinton suggested Sanders is too closely aligned with the gun industry. Sanders knocked Clinton for not releasing transcripts of her past paid speeches (while saying he would soon release a new batch of tax returns).\nOn that point, Sanders said that despite the financial industry-fueled recession, â€œSecretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech.â€?\nClinton, though, denied that any of that money influenced her decisions in office. Further, she said, â€œI stood up against behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.â€?\nSanders gave a sarcastic retort: â€œOh my goodness. They must have been really crushed by this.â€?\nAs he did on the minimum wage, Sanders also seemed to accuse Clinton of shifting her position when it came to Social Security taxes, though Clinton again claimed sheâ€™s been consistent.\nSanders has been on an election roll lately, winning seven of the last eight state contests, most recently in Wyoming over the weekend. On stage Thursday, he touted his â€œlandslide victoriesâ€? in recent contests.\nBut analysts note the primary map could soon be turning back in the front-runnerâ€™s favor, not only in New York but other Eastern primary states.\nWith the stakes getting ever-higher, the tone of the contest had sharpened well before Thursdayâ€™s debate. Sanders recently alleged Clinton may not be qualified for president, before walking back the remark. And the Clinton campaign has criticized Sanders for the aggressive efforts by some of his supporters to persuade so-called superdelegates to back the Vermont senator.\nSuperdelegates are elected officials and other party insiders free to support whomever they want. Most of them are siding with Clinton, giving her an even wider delegate lead. But Clinton noted Thursday night that she holds the pledged delegate lead as well. ?\nGoing into the Empire State primary on Tuesday, Clinton so far has held the lead in most polls. Clinton spent eight years as a New York senator.\nBut Sanders, a Vermont senator who was born in Brooklyn, has been touting his local roots as he seeks to upset Clinton in the state.\nWhile Sanders is on a winning streak in primaries and caucuses, he desperately needs a big victory in New York if he hopes to cut into Clinton's delegate lead and slow her march to the nomination. To date, Clinton has accumulated 1,758 total delegates, compared with Sandersâ€™ 1,069. It takes 2,383 to win.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Clinton, a former New York senator, holds a 250-delegate advantage over Sanders, putting pressure on the Vermont senator to pull off an upset in Clinton's home state and narrow her lead among delegates.\nSong, a California health care activist, was among several speakers to warm up the crowd before Sanders addressed a massive Wednesday night rally in New York City's Washington Square Park. The physician said that Clinton had said the Vermont senator's Medicare for all universal health care proposal would never come to fruition.\n"Well, I agree with Secretary Clinton that Medicare for all will never happen if we have a president who never aspires for something greater than the status quo," Song said to cheers. "Medicare for all will never happen if we continue to elect corporate Democratic whores who are beholden to Big Pharma and the private insurance industry instead of us."\nJennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign's communications director, responded on Twitter that it was "very distressing language to say the least" and urged Sanders to disavow the comments.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.

Itâ€™s hard to do something about it.â€? Itâ€™s a brilliant tack for her to take especially as more critics have been pointing out flaws in Sandersâ€™s plans, especially when it comes to funding his free college for all and universal health care plans.\nAnd it worked a charm.\nSanders suffered for it. She buried him in details no matter the topic. From breaking up the banks ? Sandersâ€™s signature issue that he notably struggled with during his recent Daily News interview ? to tackling climate change to raising the minimum wage to the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinians, Clinton showed how deep her understanding of the issues is and the level of specificity with which she has crafted plans to address them.\nThat doesnâ€™t mean that she was without flaws, but she did better handling them than in previous debates. For instance, Clinton is still shaky on releasing her Goldman Sachs speech transcripts and the approach of calling Sanders out for not releasing his tax returns yet doesnâ€™t exonerate her. But where she is now improved is jumping on Sanders for having absolutely no evidence that she ever made a decision based on her Wall Street ties (special thanks to Dana Bash for asking the question in the first place).\nConcerning her position on the minimum wage, Clinton tried to take credit for being for a $15 minimum wage when sheâ€™s actually only for a federal $12 minimum wage. Her approach is one that I agree with in that we should set a responsible floor and let cities decide if they can go to $15 based on their local economies. Although this isnâ€™t the position of the progressive left, her explanation of the importance of making incremental improvements appeared to resonate with the audience and with the viewers at home.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nAnd then there was her defense of our intervention in Libya, which Obama called one of his biggest regrets but one that Clinton was very much committed to. This will continue to be a sticking point for her, but she handled the criticism adeptly by pointing out that final decisions are made by presidents whether it be President Obama or President Clinton, alluding to the flack sheâ€™s taking for her husbandâ€™s 1994 Crime Bill (even though Sanders voted for the bill himself in Congress). It was a very slick move and one that will have also registered with voters.\nAs usual, Bernie was on message. He talked about the rigged economy, the dangers that corporate America pose to the average worker and the importance of doing away with Citizens United. He reiterated his position that Clinton doesnâ€™t have the right judgment to be president because of her vote for the Iraq War and that she has a Super PAC. But this evening it didnâ€™t seem to matter the way it has in the past and I think thatâ€™s because he was speaking almost entirely in rhetoric while she was offering clear ideas and solutions.\nThe latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that Clinton is up by 17 percent in New York. Thatâ€™s not apt to change and with Sanders heading Friday to the Vatican, heâ€™s giving up key campaigning time. If she wins this big in New York ? and she could certainly win in double digits ? Sandersâ€™s momentum will be slowed. He wonâ€™t drop out, but there will be an even greater case that he should.\nDouglas E. Schoen has served as a pollster for President Bill Clinton.

Sign up? here. **\nBuzz Cut:\n? Delegate selection game keeps states in play\n? Trump campaign manager wonâ€™t face charges\n? Dem debate wasnâ€™t in the plan\n? Hillary gets tepid response from black leaders\n? â€˜Teeing off is not a crimeâ€™\nDELEGATE SELECTION GAME KEEPS STATES IN PLAY\nIn a year where every delegate counts, the selection game has become a truly delicate and complex matter. Case in point: Marco Rubioâ€™s delegates. The Florida senator may not be running for president anymore, but heâ€™s still third in line when it comes to the delegate mathâ€¦for now.\nDetermining if Rubioâ€™s delegates remain bound through the first ballot at the Republican National Convention this summer is a case-by-case situation based on each stateâ€™s party rules, but it looks like heâ€™ll be losing a good portion of them before then.\nMinnesota, where Rubio won 17 delegates, says their rules allow delegates to vote for whomever they want at the national convention if the winner of their state or district isnâ€™t on the ballot, same for Oklahoma.\nRubio earned 171 delegates before suspending his campaign in March, many of whom havenâ€™t been selected as states are still holding their conventions to pick the individuals that will serve as delegates.\nSo it makes sense that Sen. Ted Cruz and frontrunner Donald Trump would home in on those state conventions where there are potentially free delegates for the taking.\nBut both candidates have spent time in states that have already voted. Why? Arenâ€™t their delegates already bound to vote for the winner of their state or district?\nIt varies by state but yes, by and large the delegates being selected at these county, district, and state conventions, in states that have already held ?their contests, are bound to whoever won the majority in their area, on the first ballot.\nYet with the increasing likelihood that no candidate wins a majority of delegates ahead of the national convention, the strategy becomes more about keeping the delegates if the convention goes to second ballot and they become freed.\nTake Virginia for example. Cruz kept organizers on the ground even after the stateâ€™s March primary in an effort to get his supporters picked as delegates. The campaign made sure his supporters applied to be delegates before the party filing deadline, and submitted a list of potential delegates. Trumpâ€™s campaign actually missed the deadline to assemble such a list.\nCruz ended up with delegate candidates in 10 of the 11 districts in Virginia. Meaning that despite Trumpâ€™s victory in the Old Dominion State, the individuals selected as delegates may not choose to stay with Trump if the national convention goes to the second ballot, especially if they are Cruz supporters.\nThis is what the Cruz campaign is banking on across the country, and why he has spent so much time and effort at state conventions and his organization has been courting party leaders. This is also why Trump has made two big hires recently in an effort to step up his delegate game.\nWhile the Trump campaign has taken heat for lagging in the pursuit of delegates, there are still several acts to go. The show on the main stage may be the battle for the remaining primaries, the winner of the sideshow of delegate selection may well be the ultimate determiner of who becomes the nominee.\n[GOP delegate count:?Trump?755;?Cruz?545; Kasich 143 (1,237 needed to win)]\nLooking ahead - FiveThirtyEightâ€™s delegate expert Nate Silver lays out the road ahead for the GOP primaries, and adjusts some of his prior predictions.

Republicans, independents, white evangelicals, and non-college graduates also prefer Trump. But Cruz leads among very conservative voters -- with 46 percent, compared to 40 percent for Trump -- and those who attend religious services weekly, and the race is close among those with a college degree. If Kasich were to drop out and the choice was between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, Trump would still lead by 10 percentage points, 48 percent to 38 percent.â€?\nTrump campaign manager wonâ€™t face charges - Fox News : â€œRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign manager will not be prosecuted on a charge of misdemeanor battery over allegations he grabbed the arm of a reporter, the campaign confirmed late Wednesday.

But while they may joust over who is the true New Yorker, it would take a major stumble by Clinton or a truly spectacular performance by Sanders to fundamentally alter the race.\nClintonâ€™s delegate lead, particularly her dominance among superdelegates, shows little sign of erosion. Polls put her solidly ahead in New Yorkâ€™s primary. Still, tonightâ€™s encounter presents Sanders with his best and possibly last chance to gain ground on Tuesday and build a level of momentum that changes the dynamics of the primary contests to come.

The military said that prosecutors informed the court that they plan on charging the soldier with manslaughter, but are still working out some technical details before formally indicting him.\nThe shooting took place last month in Hebron, a West Bank city that has been a focal point of a seven-month wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence.\nAt the time, the military said two Palestinians stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier before troops shot and killed the pair.\nBut in a video later released by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, one of the attackers was shown still alive after the initial shooting. The video, taken by a Palestinian volunteer for the group, shows the wounded attacker lying on the ground, slowly moving his head before a soldier raises his rifle and fires. Blood is then seen streaming from the Palestinian's head. An autopsy determined the bullet to the head was the cause of death.\nThe incident has triggered uproar in Israel, with the country's defense minister, military officials and many Israelis calling it contrary to the army's values. That has led to widespread support for the soldier, with many calling his actions appropriate for a country reeling from months of Palestinian attacks.\nDuring that time, 28 Israelis and two Americans have been killed in Palestinian attacks, while at least 189 Palestinians have been killed. Israel says most of the dead were attackers, with the rest killed in clashes with troops.\nIn the latest violence, the military said a Palestinian man attacked a soldier with an ax in the West Bank before he was shot and killed. It said the incident occurred near al-Aroub, a village in the southern West Bank.\nThe army said the soldier was lightly wounded.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\nVATICAN CITY ? ?Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of his ambassador to the United States who was behind Francis' controversial meeting with Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who went to jail rather than comply with a court order to issue same-sex marriage licenses.\nArchbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, 75, had submitted his resignation in January after he reached the mandatory retirement age for bishops.\nOn Tuesday, Francis accepted it and named his ambassador to Mexico, the French Monsignor Christophe Pierre, to replace Vigano in the Holy See's highest-profile diplomatic posting.\nVigano had invited Davis to be among those greeting Francis in the Vatican embassy in Washington last September during his visit to the country. Her lawyer caused an uproar when he announced the meeting shortly after Francis returned to Rome, describing it as papal affirmation of Davis' approach to conscientious objection.\nThe Vatican insisted the meeting was no such thing and that Davis was merely one of many people who were at the embassy that day. An incensed Vatican ultimately said Francis had only one private audience during his visit to Washington: With his openly gay former student and his partner.\nEven before the Davis affair, Vigano stirred controversy and was best known for his role in the first Vatileaks scandal. The scandal, which helped bring about Pope Benedict XVI's resignation, began in 2012 when an Italian journalist broadcast letters from Vigano, then the No. 2 Vatican administrator, to Benedict. In the letters, Vigano begged not to be transferred to Washington for having exposed alleged corruption in the Vatican administration that cost the Holy See millions of euros.\nDespite his protests, Vigano was sent to Washington to become ambassador in 2011.\nDuring his term, he strongly took up the religious liberty cause championed by U.S. bishops, suggesting that he might well have supported Davis in her battle over gay marriage. In a 2012 speech to the University of Notre Dame, Vigano denounced threats to religious liberty in the U.S. and abroad, citing a public school curriculum presenting same-sex relations as "natural and wholesome."\nLast year, he received two standing ovations from U.S. bishops at their conference after a speech in which he urged them to persevere in working to "preserve a moral order in society" and not "fall prey" to "secularized and increasingly pagan" practices in broader society.\nPierre, 70, has been nuncio to Mexico since 2007 and helped organize Francis' recent trip to the country. Previously he was ambassador to Haiti and Uganda.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

(Kara Schiff)\nKara Schiff, 41, of Weston, Conn., gave Fox News a close up view of conditions on Lesbos, where she worked in February and March as a volunteer with IsraAid (Kara Schiff)\nPrevious Next\nPope Francis will visit the Greek island of Lesbos Saturday to highlight the plight of the refugees who are fleeing war in the Middle East.\nHis visit is intended to show solidarity with the thousands who have risked their lives in the perilous journey here, and now face an uncertain future in detention camps.\nToday, 52,000 refugees are trapped in Greece after the Balkan countries closed their borders to block the path to Germany and Sweden. Twelve thousand Syrian refugees, mainly women and children, have been stuck at Greeceâ€™s northern border with Macedonia. A European agreement with Turkey is designed to stem the tide of refugees seeking safe haven in Europe.\nâ€œThey hugged and kissed us. It was like we gave them the world back.â€?\n- Kara Schiff, 41, of Weston, Conn.\nApproximately a half million people have lost their lives since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011. Five million Syrians have fled their war-ravaged homeland, according to the International Organization for Migration.\nSo far this year, more than 320 refugees have drowned while trying to reach Lesbos, a gateway to Europe thatâ€™s only a few miles across the Aegean Sea from Turkeyâ€™s western coast.\nKara Schiff, 41, of Weston, Conn., gave Fox News a close-up view of conditions on Lesbos, where she worked in February and March as a volunteer with IsraAid, an Israeli non-profit that helps victims of war and natural disasters throughout the world. IsraAid is one of many humanitarian organizations that have brought volunteers to help with this refugee crisis.\nData curated by FindTheData\nSchiff, an advanced emergency medical technician who works for a Greenwich, Conn., non-profit ambulance service, has seen her share of pain and suffering. But her experience on Lesbos, which she describes as a life-changing one, presented her with situations she could not have imagined.\nOn February 23, she helped deliver a baby boy to a 12-year-old Syrian girl. The girlâ€™s parents had sold her to a 50-year old man in order to raise money to evacuate the rest of the family, Schiff said.\nâ€œThe girl was catatonic. She didnâ€™t want any of the male practitioners to help or touch her,â€? said Schiff, describing the birth. â€œThat little girl wasnâ€™t prepared to be a motherâ€¦ the child wasnâ€™t ready to be anything more than a kid.â€?\nHerself the mother of 4 children, aged 4 to 14, Schiff found this devastating.\nMany of the refugees are dehydrated, said Schiff, and living on one slice of bread a day. They suffered from hypothermia that was worsened by the cold February water that splashed their rubber boats during the dangerous night crossings. Schiff and other aid workers would wade into the water to rescue the old people and children who were often in dire need of emergency care.\nOne day a fellow volunteer passed a 5-month-old boy to Schiff from a boat that had just been pulled ashore. Turkish smugglers had put the infant on board, while keeping the parents behind at gunpoint, thereby forcing them to pay a second fare to be reunited with their baby.\nâ€œI felt happiness that the child ended up here,â€? Schiff replied when asked what she felt as she held the nameless infant on the rocky Lesbos beach, â€œBut sadness because I didnâ€™t know what would happen to him without his parents.â€?\nAccording to the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, six thousand minors have been separated from their parents during this largest migration of people since World War II. Germany absorbed more than a million refugees last year.\nLittle comforts often made a big difference, Schiff said. For instance, the volunteers gave a used stroller to the parents of a 6-year-old boy who could not walk because he had no bones in his feet. His mother had to always carry him.\nâ€œThey hugged and kissed us,â€? Schiff recalled. â€œIt was like we gave them the world back.â€?\nSchiff said that she and the other volunteers smothered their emotions as they went about their work. They did not allow themselves to express their feelings. And then they found an earless black lamb on the side of a road. They named him George. Schiff bottle-fed George for the time she was on Lesbos.\nA few days before Schiff returned to the United States, the little lamb died. They buried him in the refugee camp.\nâ€œGeorgeâ€™s death gave us an outlet to release our emotions,â€? Schiff said. â€œWe all sat down and cried and hugged.â€?\nDonald Snyder was a news producer at NBC for 27 years and has been a freelance writer since his retirement.

Sign up? here. **\nBuzz Cut:\n? Trump does reset on delegates\n? Christie could tip nomination to Trump\n? Clinton, Sanders brawl in Brooklyn\n? Big Obama donors slow to warm to Hillary\n? Thereâ€™s a new dog in town\nTRUMP DOES RESET ON DELEGATES\nDonald Trumpâ€™s ability to reset the media narrative at his will has been tested the past few weeks. While he once was able to jump from one brash statement to the next, the New York businessman has had a difficult time lately changing his campaignâ€™s characterization as one that doesnâ€™t really understand the partyâ€™s delegate selection process and canâ€™t navigate its way to an outright win.\nBut his op-ed in the WSJ looks like the first sign that he might just be able to turn things around yet again. Trumpâ€™s basic point in the piece is that, yes, he understands the rules he just doesnâ€™t agree with them, arguing that the process disenfranchises voters.\nIn doing so, he sets the establishmentâ€™s process as a system severing â€œthe interests of political parties at the expense of the people,â€? and heâ€™s the man to change all that. ?And in a Reaganesque move, he asks voters: â€œHow has the â€˜systemâ€™ been working out for you and your family?â€?\nUsing this as what is likely to be his campaignâ€™s mantra over the remaining primary contests leaves Trump with two possible avenues depending on the delegate count after the last contests on June 7: If Trump wins the majority of the 1,237 delegates needed he will say he did it in spite of the establishment rules. If he loses the majority, and further loses on a second or third ballot at the convention, he will say the system is rigged. The latter could set him up for a possible third party run, which he has threatened if he felt he was treated unfairly by the Republican National Committee.\nWhatâ€™s most surprising about the piece, however, is that itâ€™s not a rail against the establishment or the rules, but rather makes the case on behalf of voters arguing that they deserve a better system for selecting a presidential nominee. Itâ€™s a change for Trump who has spent weeks lamenting the system and was called out by Sen. Ted Cruz for â€œ whining .â€?\nThe RNC has already jumped on this story releasing a memo that explains how and when campaigns were given the information on each stateâ€™s delegate process, but their response seems to merely further Trumpâ€™s additional point that the party isnâ€™t even defending the rules, theyâ€™re just saying this is what they are.\nTrump makes no argument for what he would replace the system with, but does say that he will work with the party to come up with a new system to â€œrestore the faith and the franchiseâ€? of voters. This will play well with his supporters many of whom have said they support Trump because of his ability get things done .\nWhatâ€™s also playing heavily in Trumpâ€™s favor is that many voters, and even some political insiders, are not familiar with each stateâ€™s local delegate selection process, meaning he has more freedom in building a narrative over the next few months. At this point in recent history, the party frontrunner has been pretty clearly decided already and so the local selection of delegates has played little or no importance in the national media.\nAhead of next weekâ€™s big primary in New York, which looks like a Trump blowout , his timing on this latest campaign messaging reset could be his best move yet. Riding a likely wave of victories in the East as the frontrunner who will play by the rules he vows to change for the betterment of voters is a powerful combination.\nChristie could tip nomination to Trump - WashExâ€™s David Drucker explains how the New Jersey governor enjoys a surprising amount of control over the stateâ€™s 51 delegates: â€œGov. Chris Christie could help hand the Republican presidential nomination to Donald Trump because he has unusually tight control over the 51 delegates New Jersey will send to the convention in July. Christie is one of Trumpâ€™s biggest boosters and has moved aggressively with county-level party bosses to stack the delegation with loyalists who owe him favorsâ€¦The governor enjoys an unusual command over a delegation that isnâ€™t necessarily as pro-Trump as might be assumed from the billionaireâ€™s dominance of the slate. If Christie makes a move, he could cash in his delegatesâ€™ IOUs and lead them into a rival camp.â€?\nFox News Sunday: Trump campaign leader - Trumpâ€™s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, faces Mr. Sunday in wake of the news that he will not face charges for allegedly assaulting a female reporter.

Trump responded, â€˜Well, I think many. I mean, when we get into the Bible, I think many, so many. And some people, look, an eye for an eye, you can almost say that.

Francis said. â€œIf someone thinks that greeting someone means getting involved in politics, I recommend that he find a psychiatrist.''\nSanders told Fox News on Saturday that the opportunity to talk briefly with the pope was a â€œreal honorâ€? and that he considers him one of the â€œextraordinary figuresâ€? in world history, not just modern times.\nThe Sander campaign had said it did not expect its candidate would get the opportunity to meet with the pope because he wants to stay out of the U.S. presidential race.\nSanders, the self-described democratic socialist, whose populist message continues to resonate with voters, praised the pope for â€œenlightening the world about the massive levels of income and wealth inequality, about a culture which rewards greed and ignores people who are hurting (and) about climate change.â€?\nSanders was in Rome for a Vatican conference this weekend on economic inequality and climate change. The meeting took place before the pope left for Greece, where he is highlighting the plight of refugees.\nHe trails front-runner Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. But his message about income inequality has helped him win seven of the last eight state primaries or caucuses and stay alive in the contest.\nFrancis since becoming the leader of the church in March 2013 has been remarkably outspoken on such political-charged issues as climate change and income inequality.\nSanders and his wife stayed overnight at the pope's residence, the Domus Santa Marta hotel in the Vatican gardens, on the same floor as the pope. They were seen at the hotel reception, carrying their own bags.\nJeffrey Sachs, a Sanders foreign policy adviser, said there were no photographs taken of the meeting.\nThe Vatican is loath to get involved in electoral campaigns, and usually tries to avoid any perception of partisanship as far as the pope is concerned, although Francis in February rebuked Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump over Trump's stand on immigration.\nPopes rarely travel to countries during the thick of political campaigns, knowing a papal photo opportunity with the sitting head of state can be exploited for political ends.\nBut Francis has been known to flout Vatican protocol, and the meeting with Sanders was evidence that his personal desires often trump Vatican diplomacy.\nSachs said the candidate and his wife met the pope in the foyer of the domus, and that the meeting lasted about five minutes. Sanders later joined his family, including some of his grandchildren, for a walking tour of St. Peter's Basilica, one of the holiest Catholic shrines.\nThe trip gave Sanders a moment on the world stage, putting him alongside priests, bishops, academics and two South American presidents at the Vatican conference.\nSanders has been at a disadvantage during his campaign against Clinton, President Obama's former secretary of state, on issues of foreign policy. But Sanders was peppered with questions from academics and ecclesiastics during Friday's conference in a manner that might have been afforded a head of state.\nThe invitation to Sanders to address the Vatican session raised eyebrows when it was announced and touched off allegations that the senator lobbied for the invitation.\nBut the chancellor for the pontifical academy, Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, said he invited Sanders because he was the only U.S. presidential candidate who showed deep interest in the teachings of Francis.\nOnce back home, Sanders was set to refocus on the pivotal presidential contest in New York, a state with a significant number of Catholic voters.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

He didnâ€™t even get any delegates as a result.?\nBut when the U.S. Department of the Treasury short-circuited a much-anticipated merger between two corporate giants, it was exactly the painful blow to big business that the socialist senator from Vermont has been arguing for in his passionate rhetoric of economic populism.??\nHereâ€™s what happened and why it matters.\nLast Monday, the Treasury introduced its latest set of regulations aimed at stopping U.S. companies fleeing Americaâ€™s absurdly high corporate taxes in favor of countries where they would be better treated. The poster child for this was drug company Pfizer, which had aimed to reincorporate in Ireland by merging with Dublin-based Allergan, also a pharmaceutical company.\nThe move would have made sense. Irelandâ€™s corporate tax rate is a mere 12.5 percent, while that of the U.S. is 35 percent, which when combined with state taxes comes to 39 percent. Even Britain and Canada tax at lower rates, 20 percent and 26.5 percent, respectively.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nA lot of wealth was destroyed by the Treasury that day, and the blame should fall, at least partly, at the feet of three presidential hopefuls, Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump, who each criticized the now-dead deal. Sanders even went as far as to write Treasury Secretary Jack Lew a letter specifically asking for Pfizerâ€™s plans to be thwarted.\nIt also shouldnâ€™t be a surprise that Lew acted on the Sanders prompt, given that his boss, President Obama, had already described these so-called tax inversions as â€œunpatrioticâ€? and â€œmost insidious,â€? and reflects his administrationâ€™s ongoing war with corporate America.?\nWhatâ€™s notable is that while such inversion deals would reduce taxes for the corporation, they arenâ€™t driven by the desire to find cheaper labor, just lower taxes. Itâ€™s also notable that corporate relocation of factories to countries where labor is less expensive is rarely criticized by this administration.\nTreasuryâ€™s targeting of the Pfizer-Allergan merger isnâ€™t an isolated incident. Rather it is just the latest move in the Obama administrationâ€™s savage?anti-business?war. On the tax inversion front, Treasury also nixed a 2014 attempt by Chicago-based drug company AbbVie to buy Irish company Shire and relocate headquarters to Dublin.\nOther examples of this?behavior include the Federal Trade Commissionâ€™s challenge of the Staples-Office Depot deal; the extra scrutinizing of the?Aetna-Humana and Anthem-Cigna mergers as well as the Anheuser-Busch acquisition of SAB Miller. Separately, The Department of Justice has already filed a lawsuit to block Halliburtonâ€™s acquisition of Baker Hughes. You get the idea.?\nThis time around, Treasury made its new regulations retroactive, changing the rules after the proposed merger had been legally constructed and announced. How can companies continue to confidently operate and invest in the U.S. when such uncertainty exists that the rule of law can be changed on the whim of the president?\nHigh U.S. tax rates, which certainly encourage U.S. corporations to relocate overseas, are just part of the problem which puts American companies at a distinct disadvantage against foreign competitors.\nWhy? Such punitive taxes lower returns to shareholders. It therefore shouldnâ€™t be too surprising that The Economist magazine estimated that up to nine U.S. corporations would try to move for tax reasons this year.\nOn top of that the United States has a weird idea of how taxes should work. It is one of the few countries that force its companies to pay tax on worldwide income. For instance, a U.S. corporation pays tax in Germany on its income generated there, and then again when the profits are repatriated to the U.S.\nElsewhere, corporate tax is paid only where the income is earned. It would be a double taxation, if U.S. companies were stupid enough to bring the cash home. Instead they leave the money abroad ? more than $2 trillion of it.\nThatâ€™s more than 10 percent of GDP. Imagine what that cash could be used for here in the United States if only the Treasury switched to a more sensible tax regime of taxing by jurisdiction.\nThese things matter because they are what drive the economy and hence job creation. The current presidential candidates have very different ideas about how they want to govern the U.S. for the four years starting 2017.\nSome ideas, like punitive taxes will continue to crush economic growth. Whereas others, like streamlining corporate taxes, will boost it.\nThink about that when you go to the polls this fall.\nTony Sayegh is a Republican Strategist, National Political Correspondent for Talk Radio News Service and a Fox News contributor. ?You can follow him on Twitter @tony4ny and e-mail him at? tony4ny@yahoo.com\nADVERTISEMENT\n	foxnews	U.S.

Bob Graham told Fox News on Tuesday that the White House told him a decision on whether to declassify the documents would be made within 60 days.?\nGraham helped lead a 2002 congressional inquiry into the attacks.\nThe Bush and Obama administrations have refused to unseal the documents, arguing their release would jeopardize national security.\nCritics claim the reluctance is a calculated move to hide Saudi Arabiaâ€™s involvement in the al Qaeda terror attack that killed almost 3,000 people on U.S. soil on Sept. 11, 2001.\nThe Saudi government has said it wants the pages declassified.\nObama had come under renewed pressure to release the documents ahead of a scheduled trip next week to Saudi Arabia for a summit of Persian Gulf leaders.?\nEconomists are purportedly skeptical about the Saudis making good on their vow to sell the assets, considering such a move would be difficult to execute and could severely hurt that countryâ€™s economy, which depends on the U.S. dollar.\nThe separate 9/11 Commission essentially found no evidence that the Saudi Arabia government supported the attacks.\nHowever, the commissionâ€™s narrowly worded finding about having â€œno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organizationâ€? has skeptic suggesting that lesser officials government operatives or were involved.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Bernie Sanders as typical, late-campaign rhetoric; focusing her attacks on GOP front-runner Donald Trump and even campaigning in California ahead of Tuesdayâ€™s big New York primary.\nâ€œAt the end of a campaign that is certainly hard fought, there are going to be a lot of charges and all kinds of misrepresentations,â€? Clinton told ABCâ€™s â€œThis Week,â€? avoiding a question about high-dollar campaign support and instead talking about the rival campaignsâ€™ positions on increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nâ€œLet's look at what's really at stake here,â€? she continued. â€œWe're having a vigorous back and forth about raising the minimum wage, which we both support. And the Republicans don't want to do that at all. In fact, Donald Trump has said that American workers are paid too much.â€?\nClinton has a double-digit lead over Sanders in New York, while Trump has a nearly 20-point lead over challenger Ohio Gov. John Kasich and a more-than-30-point lead over Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, second to Trump in the delegate count, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average.\nClinton talked to ABC after a big weekend of campaigning in California, which does not hold its primary until June 7, the last day of the primary season but with 475 delegates at stake.\nShe attended two fundraisers hosted by Hollywood star George Clooney -- one in San Francisco and the other in Los Angeles. And she held a rally at Southwest College, in the Los Angeles area.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nSanders supporters?were among those picketing and throwing cash at the Clinton motorcade outside of the San Francisco fundraiser Friday night.\nA $353,400 contribution, which will go to a variety of Clinton and Democratic Party-related efforts, was requested for some tickets, an amount Clooney called â€œobscene.â€?\nClinton was back in New York on Sunday, as was Sanders, who had just returned from Rome where he attended a Vatican conference at which he briefly met with Pope Francis. ?\nâ€œI have become a little bit tired of being beaten up by the negativity of the Clinton campaign. And we're responding in kind,â€? Sanders said on CBSâ€™s â€œFace the Nationâ€? about his TV debate last week with the former secretary of state and the increasing negativity in the Democratic primary.?\nThe Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist then launched into his criticism about Clintonâ€™s Wall Street ties, support for the war in Iraq and the minimum wage issue.\nClinton leads Sanders 1758-to-1076 in the delegate count with 247 at stake in New York. Sanders faces long odds in surpassing Clinton and getting 2,383 delegates to secure the nomination before the partyâ€™s July convention.\nHowever, he has beaten Clinton in seven of the last eight contests, and his campaign remains optimistic about at least perhaps challenging Clinton for so-called super-delegates at the convention in Philadelphia.\nâ€œI think we have real shot to win on Tuesday if there is a large voter turnout,â€? Sander said Sunday. â€œI think a lot of these super-delegates are going to conclude that Bernie Sanders is the candidate to prevent what must not be allowed to happen, and that is Donald Trump becoming president.â€?\nTrump has now taken to calling Clinton â€œcrooked Hillary,â€? in an apparent effort to damage her like he did by referring to Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio as â€œLittle Marco.â€?\nClinton told ABC: "What Iâ€™m concerned about is how he goes after everybody else. â€¦ He can say whatever he wants to say about me, I really could care less.â€?\nOn Sunday, Trump and his campaign also continued to criticize the Republican Partyâ€™s delegate-awarding process, which they say relies too much on party â€œbosses.â€?\nâ€œI think weâ€™re going to make it without (relying) on the bosses,â€? Trump said at a rally in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. â€œI spent practically less money than anybody else, and Iâ€™m in first place by a lot. Donâ€™t you want that for your president?â€?\nCruz has been able to out maneuver the Trump campaign for super-delegates and has taken the roughly dozen or so delegates in such states as Colorado and more recently Wyoming, which hold nomination conventions instead of caucuses or voter primaries. ?\nTrump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told â€œFox News Sundayâ€? that Cruz does better in state contests in which â€œparty bosses pick the delegates,â€? not the voters.\nHe added: â€œThere are people out there who donâ€™t have the ability to write a check,â€? to become a convention-picked delegate.\nTrump, Cruz or Kasich will need 1,237 delegates to win the Republican Party nomination. Trump leads with 744, followed by Cruz with 559 and Kasich with 144.\nKen Cuccinelli, Cruzâ€™s delegate operations director, told ABC that the Trump campaign must stop accusing Cruz of not following the delegate rules and using â€œhyperbolic rhetoricâ€? about the issue that it cannot support. ?\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said last week on Twitter that the nomination process has been known to all for more than a year and that the campaigns have a responsibility to understand the process.\nâ€œComplaints now?â€? he tweeted. â€œGive us all a break."\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Theyâ€™re really not all that different on the issues.\nItâ€™s in the nature of party primaries that the contenders have to exaggerate their differences. They need to portray their rivals as hopelessly wrong and misguided on a laundry list of subjects, or else the contest seems purely personal?and indeed, itâ€™s gotten bitterly personal between these two Democrats.\nBut when you drill down, the distinctions that raised Bernieâ€™s decibel level to 11 at the CNN debate turn more on nuance than matters of mighty principle.\nSanders wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Clinton also wants to raise the minimum wage, but to $12. So thereâ€™s a grand total of three bucks between them?and Hillary, who quickly said she sorta likes $15, has a more complicated plan (naturally) depending on local cost-of-living.\nBoth the Vermont senator and the former first lady say they want to rein in Wall Street. Sanders goes further rhetorically when it comes to breaking up the big banks, but (as Clinton pointed out) couldnâ€™t tell New Yorkâ€™s Daily News what laws he would use. His main argument is that Clinton is too close to Wall Street big shots, with the infamous six-figure speeches to Goldman Sachs, to have credibility on the subject. But when challenged by CNN, Sanders couldnâ€™t name anything Clinton had done that was influenced by those ties.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nGun control is Clintonâ€™s pivotal issue against Sanders, but he has supported, for instance, an assault-weapons ban, despite being from a rural state with no gun control laws. He does differ from her on shielding gun manufacturers from liability suits. But by and large, they are both in favor of tighter gun controls.\nFossil fuels? Clinton doesnâ€™t accept money from the industry, as Sanders once charged, because that would be illegal. Her campaign has taken money from people who work in the industry, and the Sanders camp has taken a much lesser amount. Neither is exactly sympathetic to the oil and gas crowd.\nOne of the greatest debate clashes was over Israel. Sanders, taking an unusual step in a New York Democratic primary, spoke sympathetically about respecting the Palestinians (and criticized the Jewish state for a disproportionate response to provocations in Gaza). But as secretary of State, Clinton also pursued an administration policy that would ultimately lead to a two-state solution?just as her husband did, and as Sanders favors. And despite her pro-Israel rhetoric, no administration could orchestrate a peace deal without treating the Palestinian side with respect. Indeed, Clinton said at the debate she would try to â€œget an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians,â€? while protecting Israelâ€™s security.\nThe list goes on. On issue after issue, Hillary and Bernie are, yes, liberal Democrats. They are light-years away from the Republicans on banking, minimum wage, gun control and other issues. There was a similar dynamic between Clinton and Barack Obama eight years ago. Sure, Sanders goes much further in promising, say, free college tuition, but even there Clinton decided to pitch a program of grants to the states that would allow students to avoid taking out loans.\nAnd that is telling. While it looks virtually impossible for Sanders to win the nomination, he has basically won the argument, with Clinton sliding left on a whole host of issues, including the Pacific trade deal she once backed.\nIn the end, it shouldnâ€™t be hard for Bernie supporters to back Hillary?except that many of them, who adore the 74-year-old lawmaker, are mad at her.

(AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)\nBRASILIA, Brazil ? ?For the second time in under a quarter century, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies voted to open impeachment proceedings against a democratically elected leader, dealing a devastating blow to President Dilma Rousseff, whose left-leaning Workers' Party came to power 13 year ago on the promise of improving the lot of the poor.\nDilma Rousseff: the Path to Impeachment | Graphiq\nThe 367-137 vote late Sunday in favor of impeachment was well over the 342 votes needed for the proceedings to move ahead to the Senate, where a majority vote will determine whether Rousseff is put on trial and suspended while Vice President Michel Temer temporarily takes over. The exact date of the Senate vote is not known, but it's widely expected by the middle of next month.\nThat throws the country's political landscape into confusion as Brazil prepares to host the Olympic Games in August.\nThe vote in the lower house sparked elation among many Brazilians who hold Rousseff responsible for everything from the devastating recession to chronic high taxes and poor public services. At the same time, a broad swath of the population was deeply upset by the results, which many decried as anti-democratic.\n"I'm happy because I think Dilma had to go, but I'm also both sad that it came to this and also really worried that the next president could be even worse," said Patricia Santos, a 52-year-old small business owner who was among an estimated nearly 60,000 pro- and anti-impeachment demonstrators who outside Congress. "I quiver to think what awaits us next."\nWhile Rousseff herself didn't react to the results, her party's leader in the lower house, Jose Guimaraes, acknowledged the battle had been lost, but insisted the war was just beginning.\n"The putchists won in the Chamber of Deputies. . We can turn it over in the Senate," he said. "We're going to continue to fight because we don't back down and we aren't going to let ourselves be beat by this momentary loss."\nSolicitor General Jose Eduardo Cardozo said after the vote that Rousseff would not resign and that she would address the situation Monday. He also hinted an appeal could be filed with the Supreme Federal Tribunal, Brazil's highest court.\nSunday's vote came about 24 years after the lower house opened impeachment proceedings in 1992 against Fernando Collor de Mello, Brazil's first democratically elected president after more than two decades of military rule. Collor faced corruption allegations and ended up resigning before the conclusion of his impeachment trial in the Senate.\nRousseff has been accused of violating fiscal laws by using sleight-of-hand accounting to maintain government spending. Noting she hasn't been accused of any crime, she insists the impeachment is a "coup" and has pledged never to resign.\nRousseff's foes maintain the budget maneuvers were a bid to shore up popular support as Brazil plunged into the worst recession in decades.\nRousseff says previous presidents used the same accounting maneuvers without repercussions and insists the allegations are little more than a flimsy excuse by Brazil's traditional ruling elite to snatch power back from the Worker's Party, which has governed since 2003.\nLuciano Dias, a Brasilia-based political consultant, said ultimately Rousseff "made the same mistakes that former President Fernando Collor made."\n"She took too many resources from the private sector, she was arrogant with Congress for a long time and her economic policies were just wrong," he said.\nRousseff, a one-time guerrilla fighter who was tortured under the military dictatorship, was hand-picked by charismatic former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to succeed him ? becoming Brazil's first woman president. But seven years of galloping economic growth under Silva began to flag after she took office in 2011, and she narrowly won re-election in 2014 after widespread nationwide protests a year earlier. Her popularity rating has plunged in step with the tanking economy, and opinion polls suggest a majority of Brazilians support her ouster, though many appear to have reservations about those in line to replace her.\nTemer, the vice president, has been implicated in the investigation into a mammoth corruption scheme centered on the state-run Petrobras oil company. He also could conceivably also face impeachment proceedings because he signed off on the some of the same fiscal maneuvers as Rousseff.\nThe second in line to replace Rousseff, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Eduardo Cunha, has been charged with taking $5 million in bribes in the Petrobras scheme.\nCunha was the driving force behind the impeachment proceedings ? an irony that was not lost on the government camp.\n"My God, what hypocrisy. It's not Dilma who should leave the (presidential) palace. You, Eduardo Cunha, should not be in that seat," lawmaker Moema Gramacho of the Workers' Party said as she proclaimed her "no" vote.\nAsked whether he was happy with the results, Cunha said, "All of this is very sad, very serious."\n"The president lost the ability to govern a while ago . she fell to the bottom of the well," Cunha said, adding, "Now Brazil has to get out of the well."\nA circuslike atmosphere reigned on the floor of the house during the six-hour vote. Lawmakers sporting Brazilian flag capes and red sashes jostled, jeered, cheered, chanted and snapped endless selfies as they picked their way through the packed crowd to the microphone to proclaim their votes.\nImpeachment supporters invoked God, family and Brazil to justify their votes, often saying impeachment would help put an end to endemic corruption in the country.\n"I want tomorrow to be a new day for this country, a new day of hope," said Odelmo Leao of the Progressive Party. "God bless. My vote is yes."\nRousseff's supporters said it was a blow for the poor ? an estimated 30 million of whom were lifted out of destitution, thanks in part to the Workers' Party's wealth redistribution programs.\n"This is a coup against the poor, a coup against social programs," said Workers' Party legislator Patrus Ananias.\nRobert Silva, who was collecting empty cans at the pro-impeachment rally in front of Congress, said he didn't think anything that happened within its halls would improve his lot much.\n"With Dilma, my life is like this," he said, gesturing to his shopping cart filled with crumpled aluminum cans. "I just hope with whoever's next it won't get worse."\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

The accusations he has repeatedly leveled against Israel in the past few days?that its military response to Hamas rockets and terror tunnels has been â€œdisproportionateâ€??reflects both abysmal ignorance about the conduct of the Israeli Defense Force and a pervasive bias against the nation state of the Jewish people.\nSanders is right, of course, that he is not alone in accusing Israel of using disproportionate force, but he is very bad company when he cites the â€œ countries all over the world â€? that have directed this chorus of criticism against Israel. Those who most consistently attack the conduct of the Israeli Defense Forces are among the worst human rights violators in the world, including countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria.\nThe reality is that Israel has done what other Western democracies?faced with far less direct threats to their civilians?have done, but they have done so far more carefully, with greater concern for civilians, and to better success. Yet Israel is singled out for unique condemnation as part of a widespread effort to delegitimize, and demonize the nation state of the Jewish people. Sanders has now made statements that lend support to these biased efforts\nReasonable people can disagree with Israelâ€™s occupation and settlement policies?although even critics must acknowledge that Israel offered to end the West Bank occupation and settlements in 2000, 2001, and 2008 as part of a plan to create a two-state solution. The Palestinian leadership rejected the 2000 and 2001 offers and failed to respond to the 2008 proposal . Israel did unilaterally end its Gaza occupation and settlements, only to see that area turned into a launching pad for Hamas rockets and tunnels designed to kill Israeli civilians.\nNonetheless, pro-Israel critics, both within and outside of Israel, criticize the current government for not doing more to move toward a two state solution. Whether one agrees or disagrees with this criticism, one can level it without being deemed anti-Israel. But anyone who seeks the mantle of â€œpro-Israelâ€? has no right to sit in judgment over Israelâ€™s military tactics in responding to rocket and tunnel attacks from Gaza. This is especially so if they are as uninformed as Sanders is about the situation on the ground in Israeli cities and town that are close to Gaza. As Barack Obama said when he was running for president and visited Israeli areas that were most directly impacted by rocket attacks: â€œIf somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night, Iâ€™m going to do everything in my power to stop that. And I would expect Israelis to do the same thing.â€?\nIsrael has now located and neutralized yet another terror tunnel leading from Gaza into Israel that had been built recently, and already extended â€œtens of metersâ€? underneath the border fence and into Israel proper. Its purpose is to kill, kidnap and hold hostage Israeli civilians, including children from those towns located near the tunnel exits. The entrances to these deadly military targets have been deliberately placed by Hamas in densely populated areas, rather than in the many sparely populated parts of the Gaza Strip.? (Yet there are many such sparsely populated areas, despite the mediaâ€™s demonstrably false claim that the Gaza Strip is among the most densely populated areas of the world.)\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\n?Hamas knows that if they were to deploy their rockets and place the entrances to their terror tunnels in unpopulated areas ? as the laws of war require ? the Israeli military could attack these military targets without endangering civilians.? But Hamas wants Israel to injure and kill its civilians.? They deliberately employ what has come to be known by the cruel but accurate term, â€œthe dead baby strategy.â€?? Under this double war crime strategy, the Israeli military is put to the terrible Hobsonâ€™s choice of either allowing its own civilians to be subjected to rocket and tunnel attacks or to destroy those rockets and tunnels by attacking targets that are surrounded by Palestinian civilians, who Hamas effectively uses as human shields.\nWhat would Sanders do if the United State were faced with a comparable dilemma?? Would he allow rockets to rain down on American civilians? Would he allow for terror tunnels to ferret armed terrorists to kill and kidnap American children?? Or would he do what President Obama urged Israel to do: whatever it takes to stop the rockets and tunnels.\nAmerican voters are entitled to know what Sanders would do and what he thinks Israel should do.? Would he apply a double standard to the nation state of the Jewish People?? Or would he deny the American military the authority to do whatever it takes to protect our citizens?? Does he condemn the United States military for using comparable tactics in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria? In other words, does Bernie Sanders only believe that Israel has acted disproportionately, or does he also believe that the United States military acts disproportionately? We are entitled to know the answers to these questions, and Bernie Sanders is not entitled to pretend that he is pro-Israel.\nAlan Dershowitz is emeritus professor at Harvard and author of " Taking the Stand: My Life in the Law ."\nADVERTISEMENT\n	foxnews	U.S.

The claims stem from Sandersâ€™ time as president of Burlington College between 2004 and 2011. Toward the end of her tenure, she secured loans for a $10 million purchase of 32 acres from the Roman Catholic diocese as part of a campus expansion, Heat Street reported.\nBut according to the report, Sanders at the time claimed the college had more than $2 million in fundraising commitments and pledges. Peopleâ€™s United Bank reportedly extended a $6.7 million tax-exempt loan with this understanding. The diocese reportedly underwrote a nearly $3.7 million loan as well, giving its debt repayment lower priority than the bankâ€™s.\nYet, according to the report, the lofty fundraising pledges did not materialize as planned. According to one local report, the college raised just $279,000 in fiscal 2011. In the end, the diocese reportedly did not receive the full repayment of the loan, losing between $1.6 and $2 million, according to the investigation request.\nA spokesperson for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders earlier this year called these accusations â€œrecycled, discredited garbage,â€? in a statement to Burlington TV channel WCAX.\nHeat Street is a new blog that launched Monday, aiming to â€œchallenge political correctness and 'safe space' culture.â€?

Bob Graham told Fox News last week that the White House told him a decision on whether to declassify the documents would be made within 60 days.?\nGraham helped lead a 2002 congressional inquiry into the attacks.\nThe Bush and Obama administrations have refused to unseal the documents, arguing their release would jeopardize national security.\n?\n	foxnews	U.S.

Bernie Sanders gestures as he speaks at the Californi Democrats State Convention in Sacramento, Calif., April 30. (AP)\nThe New York primary scrap between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders over US policy toward Israel seems to some Americans like a man-bites-dog story.\nHow could Bernie Sanders--the first Jewish candidate for president! -- take the Palestinian side of the Arab-Israel dispute? ?And in New York, off all places, the Jewish metropolis that another progressive Democratic candidate, Jesse Jackson, once called Hymie Town.\nArenâ€™t Democratic hopefuls supposed to court the Jews of New York by waving the Israeli flag??

It is likely that Sanders believes that Jewish young people have turned against Israel and that attacking the Jewish state is a slick move.? If so, he has been conned. In every election for the past half century, the professional propagandists and politruks of the anti-Zionist Jewish left float this â€œtrend.â€? This year, as always, the New York Times falls for it, and it gets picked up by its ?media satellites.\nNow, being critical of Israel is a rite of passage for American Jewish students at elite colleges.? It demonstrates sophistication and broadmindedness. ?There is a thrill to being so noble that you are against yourself.? But this does not affect the majority of American Jewish kids, certainly not in its toxic anti-Israel form.? And those who do join the blame-Israel-now crowd usually grow out of it as adults. That explains how the American Jewish community has managed, generation after generation, to remain on Israelâ€™s side.? ???\nThe great majority of the young Jews who support Bernie are not there because of his anti-Israel rhetoric. ?Most of them donâ€™t care enough about Israel to turn it into a voting issue.?

Mostly she personifies New York Jewish values?liberal capitalism, womenâ€™s and gay rights, free trade and its benefits, upward mobility, domestic tranquility. But she is also a potential commander in chief who knows that the critics and cynics are a minority, that the great majority of New York Jews (and American Jews, and just plain Americans) want a commander-in-chief whose foreign policy includes an unapologetic embrace of the Jewish State of the 96 percent.\nZev Chafets is a Fox News contributor.

Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton all have ties to the state. New York could be a make-or-break moment for Sanders and could provide Trump the solid victory he needs to get closer to sewing things up.\nThe New York Times writes today about the two front-runners:\nPolls have shown both front-runners ahead by double-digit margins before Tuesday's New York primary. A big win for Trump would bring him closer to winning an outright majority of Republican delegates - an outcome that remains in jeopardy and that has prompted rival Ted Cruz to mount a spirited campaign to force a contested convention.\nFor Clinton, a victory would give her a boost of momentum and perhaps a new mandate to more openly pivot her campaign to prepare for the general election. Unlike Trump, Clinton is so far ahead in the delegate count against Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) that it has become close to impossible for him to catch up.\nThereâ€™s growing sentiment that Sanders role as a spoiler is beginning to hurt Hillary Clinton. The attacks on Hillary Clinton have moved her negatives higher.\nNew polling out last night from the WSJ and NBC News suggest Hillary Clintonâ€™s negatives continue to rise. In fact, the polling shows the three front-runner are very unpopular with much of the nation. Trump and Cruz have even worse ratings than Hillary Clinton.

Romney warning that if both Ted Cruz and John Kasich stay in the race, they could hand the nomination to Trump. Politicoâ€™s Hanna Trudo writes today:\nCruz and Kasich are splitting the anti-Trump vote, the former Massachusetts governor argued in an interview with David Gregory for the former NBC hostâ€™s new podcast, â€œThe David Gregory Show."\n"I think that Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich divide the vote, if you will, and that will make it easier for Mr. Trump to win the winner-take-all congressional districts and the winner-take-all states and get the delegates he needs to either hit the 1,237 or get close enough to it that he could persuade the uncommitted delegates that he would need to get the victory on the first ballot," Romney said.\nIf Cruz or Kasich becomes â€œinactiveâ€? after New Yorkâ€™s primary on Tuesday, however, Republicans would likely move to a contested convention, he said. â€œIf it remains three candidates, I think Mr. Trump wins on the first ballot.â€?\nWhen asked about Trumpâ€™s ability to gain the support of uncommitted delegates and thus secure the nomination, Romney mentioned perks that the billionaire could offer, such as trips on his private plane or resort memberships.\nâ€œI think thereâ€™s a lot of ways to be persuasive,â€? he said, adding that itâ€™s conceivable that Trump could win over as many as 50 or 100 uncommitted delegates.\nRomney dismissed, however, Trump's repeated complaint that the delegate-selection process is "rigged" against him.\nTrump held a massive rally last night in Buffalo.

Speaking to cheering supporters Tuesday night at Trump Tower, he declared: â€œWe donâ€™t have much of a race anymore.â€?\nâ€œSenator Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated,â€? Trump claimed. â€œWeâ€™re really, really rockinâ€™.â€?\nTrump is poised to exceed 50 percent of the vote, which would be a first for him in any state and give him a shot at claiming all 95 of the state's delegates. Incoming returns show him with roughly 60 percent.\nFox News projects Ohio Gov. John Kasich will place second in the state, leaving Texas Sen. Cruz to finish third.?Cruz, though, all along has downplayed Trumpâ€™s strong showing in New York as expected.\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton soundly defeated Vermont Sen. Sanders in her adopted home state, where she served as senator for eight years. Despite Brooklyn-born Sandersâ€™ hard-fought attempt at an upset, the former secretary of state successfully staved off that possibility Tuesday night. With most precincts reporting, Clinton won 57 percent to Sandersâ€™ 43 percent.\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nâ€œThereâ€™s no place like home,â€? Clinton said at her victory rally.\nClinton claimed the race for the nomination is now entering the â€œhome stretchâ€? and â€œvictory is in sight.â€? In an apparent bid to bridge divides in the party amid an increasingly bitter primary, she directed a message to Sanders voters: â€œThere is much more that unites us than divides us.â€?\nClinton and Trump both were seeking rebound victories Tuesday after recent setbacks. Cruz has complicated Trump's path to the nomination by winning recent contests like Wisconsin and getting allies elected to state delegate slates. On the Democratic side, Sanders had been on a winning streak up until Tuesday ? winning seven of the eight prior contests.?\nWhether Trump and Clinton's performance Tuesday will help either wrap up the race in the coming weeks remains an open question. The campaigns head next to five Eastern states that vote next Tuesday: Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware.\nItâ€™s potentially friendly territory for the front-runners. But unless Trump can drive Kasich and Cruz out of the race, the billionaire businessman still may have to fight all the way until the final primary contests on June 7 ? especially with an eye toward delegate-rich California, which may end up the determining race ? to see if he can clinch the nomination with the necessary 1,237 delegates.\nAs of Tuesday night, Trump had 804 delegates. Cruz had 559, and Kasich had 144.\nCruz, who infamously panned Trump's "New York values" earlier in the primary, had been bracing for a tough showing in the Empire State and showed no signs of throwing in the towel. The Texas senator was already looking ahead, turning his attention to Pennsylvania, where he delivered a speech calling on Americans to join together to move the country forward.?\n"It is time for us to get up, shake it off and be who we were destined to be,â€? he said.?\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton could easily attain the necessary 2,383 delegates to win by June. The question is whether Sanders would accept it ? as her tally includes the support of party insiders known as â€œsuperdelegates,â€? and the Sanders campaign has suggested they shouldnâ€™t count toward that 2,383-delegate threshold.\nAs of Tuesday night, Clinton had 1,862 total delegates, compared with Sandersâ€™ 1,161.\nLooking ahead, Sanders was campaigning Tuesday as well in Pennsylvania. He hammered his campaign themes about a â€œriggedâ€? economy and â€œcorruptâ€? campaign finance system, while urging voters to join him in challenging the status quo.\nâ€œWeâ€™re gonna win this election,â€? Sanders vowed.?\nAt stake in New York was a huge delegate haul.\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton and Sanders competed for 247 delegates, while Republicans battled for 95 of them. Trump, originally from Queens, needed to win more than 50 percent of the vote statewide -? and dominate across the congressional districts -- to have a shot at claiming all those delegates. At the very least, it appeared he would come close.\nDemocratic Primaries and Caucuses To Date | InsideGov\nThe importance of every last delegate has increased in recent weeks as Cruz has appeared to outmaneuver Trumpâ€™s campaign in the behind-the-scenes preparations for Julyâ€™s convention.\nCruz has been laying the groundwork for a contested convention ? where no candidate has the necessary 1,237 delegates ? by getting allies elected as delegates. That way, if voting extends to a second round, some of those pledged to Trump on the first round could peel off and support Cruz. This has heightened the pressure on Trump to clinch the nomination before the convention.?\nA Kasich campaign memo, meanwhile, touted the Ohio governorâ€™s chances in the upcoming state contests ? and his prospects for securing delegate support in the event of a contested convention.\nRepublican Primaries and Caucuses To Date | InsideGov\nâ€œItâ€™s now or never to stop Trump and save the Republican Party,â€? the memo said.?\nThe primary-day voting was not without its problems in New York. Voters ran into an array of polling-site glitches earlier Tuesday as they tried to cast ballots ? with some locations opening late and others using broken machines.\nThe Wall Street Journal ?reported that some voters waited hours to cast ballots at a site in Brooklyn, where workers apparently did not have the keys when it was supposed to open Tuesday morning. Elsewhere in the borough, voters reportedly were turned away due to technical problems.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also responded Tuesday to reports that thousands of registered Democrats have been dropped from the rolls, especially in Brooklyn. In a statement, the mayor called for major reforms to the election board and voiced support for an audit -- which the city comptroller has ordered. ?\nâ€œIt has been reported to us from voters and voting rights monitors that the voting lists in Brooklyn contain numerous errors, including the purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters from the voting lists,â€? he said in a statement. â€œI am calling on the Board of Election to reverse that purge and update the lists again â€¦â€??\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

While a candidate always likes to win by a healthy margin, frontrunner Donald Trump has extra incentive to run up the score in his home state.\nIf Trump gets more than 50 percent of the statewide vote in New Yorkâ€™s GOP-only primary, he automatically gets 14 of the stateâ€™s 95 delegates. No big whoop. But, he can really start to add to his totals in the stateâ€™s 27 congressional districts.\nEach district has three delegates to award. First place gets two delegates, while the second-place finisher gets one, provided they get at least 20 percent of the vote. But if Trump gets more than half of the vote district by district, he gets all three delegates.\nItâ€™s conceivable that Trump could sweep the state, which would mean an almost 50 percent increase in his delegate lead over Sen. Ted Cruz. It would also shift Trumpâ€™s path to clinching the nomination outright to much more certain terrain.\nThat would be a great night for Trump, as would any outcome that features a majority statewide and majorities in at least half the districts. If Trump grabs 75 delegates or more, heâ€™s really making the most of his home-state advantage.\nAnd given that the Real Clear Politics average for the state shows Trump not just 30 points ahead of Cruz but clearing the 50-percent threshold, he ought to be able to get at least 60 delegates without breaking a sweat.\nIf Trump misses a statewide majority and/or gets less than two thirds of the delegates available, he will have underperformed.\nGiven the fact that the primary is closed to non-Republicans and party switchers would have needed to have changed their registrations in October to be eligible , GOP stalwart Cruz has some hopes of snatching some of the relatively scant numbers of party loyalists and conservatives in the state.\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, meanwhile, hopes to bag some delegates in the tonier precincts where the dying vestiges of country club Republicanism live on.\nWith voter turnout expected to crush the puny showing of less than 200,000 in the no-consequence 2012 GOP state primary, you should get to know who New Yorkâ€™s remaining Republicans are and how to win their votes.\n[GOP delegate count:?Trump?756;?Cruz?559; Kasich 144 (1,237 needed to win)]\nBIG APPLE BIG FOR TRUMP\nOnly New York City could have produced Trump. Born to privilege but in an outer borough, Trump has learned to surf through the cityâ€™s celebrity obsessed media maelstrom like no other businessman. The gossip columns and the business pages, for good and ill, have been his haunts for more than 30 years.\nWhat sets Trump apart from other tycoons is that he has always been a blue-collar guyâ€™s idea of what a rich guy should be like. His wealth equates not to mergers and acquisitions and wood-paneled private clubs, but wealth that buys the privilege of saying whatever he wants, always having a beautiful model on his arm and opulence that would make a sultan blush.\nItâ€™s worked with voters in places like Massachusetts and New Hampshire already, and Trump knows there are a lot of the same kinds of guys in his native city.\nTake Richmond County ? Staten Island ? home to the lone Republican district in the city. As has been much reported , Trump should have a blow-out victory here, with some projections saying he could top 60 percent. His tough-talk and bullish attitude represent the ethos of the so-called â€œforgottenâ€? borough of New York perfectly.\nWhat makes the New York metro area so different is that Trumpâ€™s support will extend beyond the working-class voters who have sustained him elsewhere, especially on Long Island where Trumpâ€™s style and rhetoric donâ€™t offend as they have in other upscale suburbs.\nRichmond County: Staten Island\n	foxnews	U.S.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, of Florida.\nDeutsch raised concerns about the Hillary Victory Fund reportedly receiving individual contributions of $354,400 or more, which far exceed the $2,700 limit on campaign contributions.\nHe wrote that the campaign was â€œparticularly concernedâ€? about such contributions appearing to have been used to pay for $16.4 million in advertising and solicitations for the Clinton campaign, Hillary for America, â€œrather than to the DNC or any of the participating state party committees.â€?\nThe letter also complained that the joint committee paid the Clinton campaign committee $2.6 million to "reimburse" staffers for time spent running the joint committee. The letter follow a big weekend of Clinton fundraisers including events in San Francisco and Los Angeles where some attendees could pay up to $353,000 to sit at a table with host George Clooney.\n?\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nThe Clinton campaign, though, hit back, calling Sanders' attacks "irresponsible" and "misleading" -- and describing their own fundraising with the DNC as above-board.\nOn a conference call, campaign manager Robby Mook said Sanders also started a joint account with the DNC, but opted not to raise money for it.?\n"The Sanders campaign's false attacks have gotten out of hand,â€? Mook said in a statement. â€œAs Senator Sanders faces nearly insurmountable odds, he is resorting to baseless accusations of illegal actions and poisoning the well for Democratic candidates up and down the ticket.â€?\nSanders repeatedly has attacked Clinton for her connections to Wall Street and other high-dollar donors, while touting that his insurgent campaign has challenged Clinton and the entire Democratic establishment largely with individual, small-dollar contributions.\nThe Sanders campaign followed the letter to Wasserman-Schultz with a fundraising email that in part stated:\nâ€œThe Clinton campaign is bending campaign finance rules to their breaking point all so Wall Street fat cats â€¦ can contribute 130 times the legal limit to support her campaign. â€¦ Contribute $2.70 to Bernieâ€™s campaign today â€¦ as a way of saying you have had enough of the way Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign is funding its campaign and super PAC.â€?\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Peter Feaman, an RNC committee member and member of the Republican Partyâ€™s rules committee, recently told The Washington Times.?\nYet one proposed change could have worked to Trump's advantage.\nA firestorm earlier had erupted between the RNC and the rules committee over potentially changing which rule book would be used at the convention -- from the one used in the House of Representatives to Roberts Rules of Order, governing most town hall and other small governmental meetings.\nSome on the committee wanted to pursue the change, reportedly hoping it would make it harder for GOP leaders to nominate an outside candidate.?\nBut the RNC reportedly wonâ€™t consider switching to "Roberts Rules," in part because the change also would make it more difficult for Ohio Gov.

Lew said.\nIn being featured on the front of the $20 bill, Tubman will be the first African American on U.S. paper money ever, and the first woman in 100 years.?\nLew called it a â€œpowerful message,â€? and described Tubmanâ€™s life as the â€œessential story of American democracy.â€? Jackson, the nation's seventh president and a slave owner, will be pushed to the back of the bill.\nLew said the back of the $5 bill also will be changed to reflect historical events at the Lincoln Memorial ? including Martin Luther Kingâ€™s â€œI Have a Dreamâ€? speech and black female singer Marian Andersonâ€™s famous 1939 performance. The back of the $10 note, he said, will honor heroes of the campaign for womenâ€™s right to vote.\nBut on the front of that bill will remain Hamilton, whom Lew described as the â€œarchitect of our economic system.â€?\nLew is hoping to unveil the new bills in 2020.\n?\nLewâ€™s announcement follows a heated debate ever since he said last summer the government planned to incorporate a woman on the $10 bill.\nPresident Andrew Jackson | InsideGov\nThat set off a firestorm of protests from supporters of Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary. They argued the founding father had molded the nation's financial architecture and should not be removed from his rightful place on the currency.\nHamilton fans got a boost from the interest generated by the hit Broadway musical "Hamilton." Earlier this year, Lew was personally lobbied by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the author and star of "Hamilton," during a meeting at Treasury.\nTreasury all together received more than 1.5 million responses to Lew's request for suggestions on the currency redesign. That prompted him to delay an announcement, which he had originally said would be made by the end of 2015.\nMeanwhile, an online group, Women on 20s, campaigned for a woman on the $20 bill. Jackson's critics say he should not be on U.S. currency because of the part he played in the relocation of Native Americans.?And in a poll conducted last year by Women on 20s, Tubman, the African-American abolitionist and one of the leaders of the Underground Railroad, was the top vote getter to replace him.?\nStill, the change is likely to inflame lawmakers from Tennessee, which Jackson represented in Congress before becoming president. The state also generally claims the former president was born in an area that is now part of Tennessee.?\nThe last woman featured on U.S. paper money was Martha Washington, who was on a dollar silver certificate from 1891 to 1896. The only other woman ever featured on U.S. paper money was Pocahontas, from 1865 to 1869. Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea are on dollar coins.?\nA woman, a leader, and a freedom fighter.

But Trump got to be the front-runner by relying on his gut, and belatedly figured out that he needed to do what he kept musing about doing: acting more presidential.\nTrump lowered the decibel level on his Twitter feed, practically scrubbing it of insults. He started doing fewer television interviews?he hasnâ€™t been on a Sunday show in two weeks. He railed against the â€œriggedâ€? primary process, but not against people in particular. He avoided the self-inflicted wounds of shifting answers on abortion and going after another candidateâ€™s wife. In short, he was more disciplined.\nAt the same time, the breadth of his New York victory, winning nearly all of the 95 delegates at stake while Cruz was shut out, had an immediate impact on the punditry. Now many reporters and commentators are back to saying he is close to unstoppable, even if he falls short of the magic number of 1,237, which was pretty much the conventional wisdom until Wisconsin changed the narrative.\nThe #NeverTrump movement hasnâ€™t given up. Itâ€™s possible the Trump train could still be derailed. But for now, at least, the candidate is giving his enemies less ammunition to work with.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.

Slate says that â€œthis election has given us a good measure of just how far weâ€™ve defined down presidential. Trump may indeed have been restrained on Tuesday night in celebrating his predictable but impressive win in the New York Republican primary, but he was certainly not presidential.

And if he is not nominated on the first ballot, given Cruzâ€™s wildly successful delegate strategy, it is unlikely he will be nominated at all.â€?\nThe New York Times sees a two-front war, what it calls â€œincongruous, split-screen politics: While Mr. Trump draws adulatory crowds by the thousands to his rallies in arenas and airplane hangars, he has suffered setback after setback in the roadside hotels and high school auditoriums where? Republican Party ?activists decide who will serve as delegates.â€?\nAnd an internal Trump memo, which just happened to make its way to the Washington Post ,\n"The Cruz spin machine produces more lies than anything else. Our projections call for us to accumulate over 1400 delegates and thus a first ballot nomination win in Cleveland."\nThe Times editorial page , though, hasnâ€™t given up, saying Cruz, â€œthe thoroughly unlikable Texan, who has proved he will do or say nearly anything to win, has been raising weak ballot challenges aimed at disqualifying Mr. Kasich from various state contestsâ€¦\nâ€œMr. Kasich is not an exciting candidate, or even a political moderate. But he is the most sane-sounding individual in the Republican field, and has been from the start.â€??\nWell, Kasich did win Trumpâ€™s district in Manhattan.\nA similar debate is playing out on the Democratic side after Hillary Clinton trounced Bernie Sanders in her adopted home state. With Sanders close to being mathematically eliminated from a first-ballot win, the pundits are asking: What does Bernie want? Will he drop out, despite sitting on truckloads of money? Or will he at least tone down his attacks on Hillary?\nSuccessful presidential candidates evolve and adapt. Clintonâ€™s victory speech Tuesday night was far better and more passionate than most of her previous efforts.\nAnd Trump, amazingly, saw the virtue of brevity. Now weâ€™ll see, as he heads to favorable turf next week in such states as Pennsylvania and Maryland, whether he sticks to the script.\nClick for more Media Buzz.\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

(AP)\nThe flame for South America's first Olympics was kindled Thursday at the birthplace of the ancient games in Greece, heralding the start of a 15-week journey that will culminate with the August 5 opening ceremony in Rio de Janeiro.\nInternational Olympic Committee leaders and Brazilian organizers attending the flame-lighting in the ruins of Ancient Olympia voiced strong confidence that Brazil will stage successful games, despite a political crisis which forced Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff to cancel a scheduled appearance at the ceremony.\nRousseff faces possible impeachment before the games over alleged accounting tricks in managing the federal budget. The host country is also beset by corruption scandals, a deep recession and the Zika virus outbreak, while games-related problems include spending cuts, slow ticket sales and delays in some venues.\nBrazilian Sports Minister Ricardo Leyser said the country's woes will have "no impact" on the games.\n"It will be a big party and people will forget the other problems and just focus on the games," he told reporters. "So I don't think it's really a problem for the games."\nCarlos Nuzman, head of the Rio organizing committee, said the Olympics will help unite Brazilians and pledged that the host city "is ready to deliver history."\nTotal Summer Olympics Medal Count | Graphiq\n"We are incredibly proud to have come so far, sailing through some of the most challenging waters the Olympic movement has seen," Nuzman said, adding that the Olympic flame "brings a message that can and will unite our dear Brazil."\nThe IOC insists that the Rio Games will be a success, maintaining that preparations are already at an operational phase.\nIOC President Thomas Bach said Rio will provide "a spectacular stage" for the Olympics.\n"These Olympic Games will be a message of hope in troubled times ? and indeed the flame will carry this message into all corners of Brazil and, indeed, all the world," he said. "Despite the difficulties that Brazil is facing today, the flame is a timeless reminder that we are all part of the same humanity."\nBach said 98 percent of all infrastructure is ready and the test events are going well, adding that he is "very confident" on the games' success.\nThe flame was lit outside the 7th Century B.C. Temple of Hera in Olympia by Greek actress Katerina Lehou, in a long pleated dress impersonating a pagan high priestess. After a mock prayer to the ancient Greek gods, she used a concave mirror to focus the sun's rays on her torch, and the ceremony continued in the ancient stadium ? which was used at the 2004 Athens Games as the shot put venue.\nThe flame-lighting ceremony, a key part of the Olympic pageantry, dates to one of the more awkward moments of the modern games, the 1936 Berlin Olympics conducted by Nazi Germany.\nThe first torchbearer, Greek world gymnastics champion Eleftherios Petrounias, took delivery of the flame and handed it to Brazilian former volleyball great Giovane Gavio at the beginning of a relay involving hundreds.\nThe relay will traverse Greece for six days until the April 27 handover to Brazilian officials in Athens, at the refurbished ancient stadium where the first modern games were held in 1896.\n"This is the beginning of ... the last stretch of the organization," Bach said. "We're really looking forward to the moment when this flame is finally burning in the Olympic cauldron in Rio de Janeiro."\nIn a nod to the global refugee crisis, the Greek leg will include a stop at a camp in Athens that is home to 1,500 refugees and migrants trapped in Greece ? one of whom will participate in the relay ? while a young Syrian boy from another camp will accompany the torchbearer in a small town just north of Olympia.\nFor the first time at the Rio Games, the IOC will allow a group of 5-10 refugee athletes to participate, marching behind the Olympic flag at the opening ceremony. IOC officials say there are 42 potential participants, and the final selection will be made in June.\n"We thought that this is the responsibility of the International Olympic Committee to send a signal of solidarity with refugees who are fleeing their homes from war and from violence," Bach said. "We wanted to give (them) a home in the Olympic village. We wanted to give them a flag, with the Olympic flag ... an anthem to identify with ? the Olympic anthem."\nAfter a brief stopover in Switzerland, the flame will start its travels through Brazil on May 3, starting in the capital of Brasilia. Organizers say it will reach most of the vast country's 200 million population, covering 12,000 miles by road and 10,000 miles by air to reach hundreds of cities and towns in a giant effort involving 12,000 torchbearers.\nIn a departure from customary practice, Rio will have two stadiums: the Maracana for the opening and closing ceremonies and soccer, and the Olympic Stadium across town, which will be used for track and field. After the first night in the Maracana, the flame will depart for an undisclosed downtown location for the rest of the games.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Here's why	2016-04-21 00:00:00	Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print\n?\nThe Republican presidential candidates have figured out that theyâ€™ll need 1,237 delegate votes to win the nomination. Ours is a federal system, so delegates are chosen according to rules of state Republican parties. Despite all too familiar broadsides against â€œParty Elites,â€? Donald Trump has hired one of the best convention managers on the Republican side to compete in the hunt for unbound delegates.\nRepublicans havenâ€™t had a contested convention in 40 years, so operatives with those skills ?are being brought back. Itâ€™s reminiscent of Yoda in Star Wars decrying that no one teaches the Jedi Arts anymore.\nThe three Republican candidates are putting together teams of professionals that are compiling information on all of the target delegates.? This could be a long list given the possibility of multiple ballots, and in the age of the Internet would include quite a bit of material, such as biographical data, likes and dislikes, friends and enemies, and views on issues. The process is continual, which means multiple contacts and â€œbaby sittingâ€? to monitor evolving attitudes. Delegates can and will change their minds and good delegate operations have a plan to deal with that.\nNot surprisingly, the media have focused on financial inducements and potentially corrupt offers to delegates.? Donald Trump recently joined the fray, boasting that he has the best â€œtoysâ€? to woo delegates and again calling the system â€œcorrupt.â€?\nMy experience working with GOP delegates at numerous conventions tells me they are far more interested in saving the world than making a buck.\nThere will surely be talk of jobs offered, benefits to relatives and the like, but this is overstated and misses the point that most delegates donâ€™t seek the position to engage in petty graft.\nThere are also numerous laws involved that campaigns would violate at their peril.\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nDelegates are interested in picking the next president far more than incremental monetary gain. My experience working with GOP delegates at numerous conventions tells me they are far more interested in saving the world than making a buck.\nLikewise, threats and blandishments will be episodic at best. Unless Tony Soprano is elected from New Jersey, this tactic is unlikely to be widely utilized. In addition to Trumpâ€™s broadsides, his supporters have floated ideas such as publishing recalcitrant delegatesâ€™ hotel room numbers. These tough guy statements will not be effective in a world of saturation media coverage.\nMost delegates are paying attention to the campaign and the issues so it is not surprising that the candidates will appeal to them on the basis of key issues and philosophy. There will be single issue delegates (pro-life, pro-gun rights) and the candidates will want to talk up those positions. Beyond that, we can expect the campaigns to ferret out the hierarchy of issues, i.e. which do delegates consider the most important. The campaignsâ€™ issue experts will provide regular briefings on foreign policy, economic policy, and constitutional law for those interested.??\nAt the core of a good delegate operation is personal persuasion and establishing a lasting connection with the delegates. Everyone likes to feel important and delegates are no exception. Prior to the 1976 convention, uncommitted delegates were invited to the White House to attend state dinners and personal meetings with the President. More than a few were seen on Air Force One. This was all perfectly legal and, incidentally, quite effective. While none of the candidates are capable of offering such an array of inducements, a candidate could host personal meetings with his team for instance. All candidates have important surrogates who will be assigned to call delegates on a regular basis. Picture a Monday morning at the office of an uncommitted delegate, â€œMr. Smith, Governor Christie is calling on Line 1. Remember that Senator Graham called just a few minutes ago.â€?\nMost importantly, campaigns will look to friends, business associates or even family members to weigh in directly with delegates. The good campaigns will build a web of personal advocates who will stay in regular touch with each delegate target. For the four or more days of the Republican convention, delegates will be at the center of the universe and courted right up to the final vote.\nNot surprisingly, arcane delegate rules are of little interest to voters angry about the status quo. Many could react poorly to a protracted contest on national television. ?But there are no perfect alternatives for the GOP and things could be far worse for them if they disregarded long established rules and caved to intimidation."\nThe pursuit of uncommitted delegates is not different from a president seeking enactment of a key legislative priority with Congress, something well known to Ted Cruz and John Kasich, or a businessman asking zoning approval for a new project before City Council, something that Donald Trump surely understands. It takes focus, time, and one on one attention to round up the winning votes. In a political era dominated by big money and data accumulation, personal interactions and building relationships is a healthy development.\nA longtime Republican political activist, Frank Donatelli is executive vice president and director of federal public affairs for McGuireWoods Consulting LLC, and serves as counsel with McGuireWoods LLP.?

But one runner won't be at the starting line with everyone else -- heâ€™ll take his mark about 250 miles above the Earth.\nRelated: 18 Unforgettable Moments in Space Exploration\nBritish astronaut Tim Peake will be running the marathon from the International Space Station. How exactly will this work ? He'll be hooked up to the space station's treadmill, the T2 Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill (COLBERT -- yes, named after Stephen Colbert) with a harness and two bungee cords.\nEven though he won't be on the ground, he'll use an app called RunSocial to track his progress and take in images of London's city streets as he runs.\nRelated: Could This Inflatable Habitat Be the Future of Space Tourism?\n"I don't think you can ever do enough training for a marathon," Peake said during a video press conference earlier this week.

He is aiming to complete the race in three and a half to four hours.\nThis isn't the first time an astronaut has run a marathon from space.

But he was much criticized by the British media and British politicians for intruding into a debate about the future of Europe and Britainâ€™s role in it.?\nObama defended his actions by suggesting that in a democracy, friends should be able to speak their minds, even when they are visiting another country: â€œIf one of our best friends is in an organization that enhances their influence and enhances their power and enhances their economy, then I want them to stay in. Or at least I want to be able to tell them â€˜I think this makes you guys bigger players.'"\nNor did he stop at merely giving the British voters unsolicited advice, he also issued a not so veiled threat.? He said that â€œThe UK is going to be in the back of the queueâ€? on trade agreements if they exit the EU.\nPresident Obama must either have a short memory or must adhere to Emersonâ€™s dictum that â€œfoolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.â€?? Recall how outraged the same President Obama was when the prime minister of a friendly country, Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke his mind about the Iran Deal.?\nThere are, of course, differences: first, Israel has a far greater stake in the Iran deal than the United States has in whatever decision the British voters make about Brexit: and second, Benjamin Netanyahu was representing the nearly unanimous view of his countrymen, whereas there is no evidence that Americans favor or oppose Brexit in large numbers.?\nAnother difference, of course, is that Obama was invited to speak by Cameron, whereas, Netanyahu was essentially disinvited by Obama.? But under our tripartite system of government, that fact is monumentally irrelevant.?\nNetanyahu was invited by a co-equal branch of the government, namely Congress, which has equal authority over foreign policy with the president and equal authority to invite a friendly leader.? Moreover, not only are the British voters divided over Brexit, but the conservative party itself is deeply divided.\nIndeed, the leading political figure in opposition to Britain remaining in the EU is a potential successor to Cameron as leader of the Conservative party.? So these differences certainly donâ€™t explain the inconsistency between Obamaâ€™s interference in British affairs and his criticism of Netanyahu for accepting an invitation from Congress to express his countryâ€™s views on an issue directly affecting its national security.\nSo what is it Mr. President? ?Should friends speak their minds about controversial issues when visiting another country, or should they keep their views to themselves? Or is your answer that friends should speak their minds only when they agree with other friends, but not when they disagree?? Such a view would skew the market place of ideas beyond recognition.?\nA wit once observed that â€œhypocrisy is the homage vice pays to virtue.â€?? It is also the currency of diplomacy and politics.? That doesnâ€™t make it right.\nThe President owes the American people, and Benjamin Netanyahu, an explanation for his apparent hypocrisy and inconsistency.?? Let there be one rule that covers all friends ? not one for those with whom you agree and another for those with whom you disagree.? For me the better rule is open dialogue among friends on all issues of mutual importance.? Under this rule, which President Obama now seems to accept, he should have welcomed Prime Minister Netanyahuâ€™s advocacy before Congress, instead of condemning it.\nAlan Dershowitz is emeritus professor at Harvard and author of " Taking the Stand: My Life in the Law ."\nADVERTISEMENT\n	foxnews	World

Trump told the crowd of about 1,000. â€œHave you seen Hillary Clinton using a teleprompter â€¦ . People starting yawning. Itâ€™s a disaster.â€?\nHe also returned to calling Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, â€œCrooked Hillaryâ€? and the argument that the Washington Republicansâ€™ system of awarding delegates for primary and caucus wins is â€œrigged.â€?\nTrump appeared unwilling to spare anybody on Saturday, suggesting GOP rival Ohio Gov. John Kasich change the spelling of his last name so that it could be more easily pronounced. And he returned to calling his closest primary rival, Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, â€œLyinâ€™ Ted,â€? after referring to him as â€œSenator Cruzâ€? after Trumpâ€™s commanding victory Tuesday in the New York primary.\nâ€œI sorta donâ€™t like toning it down,â€?

"Equal pay? We shouldn't be talking about it in 2016. It's almost embarrassing.â€?\nKasich was in Rhode Island, while Cruz, the most conservative in the GOP field, was in Indiana, ahead of that stateâ€™s May 3 primary.\nCruz finished third in the New York primary and is not projected to do well Tuesday, according to most polls.\nThose polls show Trump with double-digit leads in Tuesdayâ€™s races.\nClinton also leads in all five states but by single-digit margins in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, according to several polls.\nTrump will look to increase his delegate count toward getting 1,237 of them to secure the GOP nomination before the partyâ€™s convention in July. He now has 845 pledged delegates, followed by Cruz with 559 and Kasich with 148.\nClinton has 1,428 pledged delegates, compared to 1,153 for Sanders, toward securing their partyâ€™s presidential nomination with 2,383 delegates.\nEarlier Saturday, at a rally in Waterford, Conn., Trump made similar, sarcastic remarks about appearing more presidential, a move his campaign and wife Melania apparently have urged him to make.\nTrumpâ€™s new senior adviser, Paul Manafort, privately assured Republican National Committee officials at their spring meeting in Florida this week that the candidate knows he needs to tone down the vitriol and that Trump is merely â€œprojecting an image.â€?\nâ€œThe part that heâ€™s been playing is now evolving,â€?

The only thing they can hope is we donâ€™t get it on the first ballot,â€? the billionaire businessman told those attending a rally in western Maryland. "I'm only interested in the first ballot. I'm not interested in second, third, fourth, nineteenth, because I'm really interested in winning it early. That's it."\nTrump is trying to get 1,237 delegate through primary and caucus wins to secure the nomination. Without the requisite number, delegates will vote at the convention on the first ballot for the delegate to whom they are bound. However, they are essentially free to support another candidates in ensuing rounds of balloting.?\nTrump thinks that his big New York primary win last week and project success in remaining states races -- including the five in Northeast states Tuesday and California in early June -- will give him the 1,237 delegate and eliminate the possibility of multiple balloting.\nRival Texas Sen.

Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced late Sunday that they were coordinating their efforts in three upcoming primary states in an extraordinary attempt to prevent Republican front-runner Donald Trump from clinching the GOP nomination before this summer's convention.\nIn a pair of simultaneously released statements, the campaigns announced that Kasich would pull out of Indiana to give Cruz "a clear path" ahead of that state's winner-take-all primary May 3, while the Cruz campaign will "clear the path" for Kasich in Oregon, which votes May 17, and New Mexico, which votes June 7.\n"Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans," Cruz's campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said. "To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead."\nThe arrangement marks a sharp reversal for Cruz's team, which aggressively opposed the idea of a coordinated anti-Trump effort as recently as late last week. Yet it underscores a bleak reality for the billionaire businessman's Republican foes: Time is running out to stop him.\nTrump responded on Twitter shortly before midnight Monday.\nWow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination.

Trump campaigned Sunday in Maryland, which will vote on Tuesday along with Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware.\nTrump needs 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination. If he falls short, the national Republican gathering in July will evolve into a rare contested convention.\nAt a rally in Hagerstown, Md., Trump stressed repeatedly that he expects to win the 1,237 delegates needed in the first round of voting to stave off a contested convention.\n"I only care about the first. We're not going for the second and third and fourth and fifth," said Trump.\nEven before the plan was announced, Cruz had all but abandoned the Northeastern states in favor of Indiana, which holds its primary on May 3. Both Cruz and Kasich had cast the state as a critical turning point.\n"Keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1,237 bound delegates before Cleveland," Kasich's campaign said Sunday. "We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already, and given the current dynamics of the primary there, we will shift our campaign's resources west and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana."\nIndiana will award 57 delegates to the winner of its primary.

(AP)\nWARRINGTON, England ? ?The families of 96 Liverpool soccer fans who were crushed to death at a crowded stadium in 1989 declared they had finally won justice Tuesday after a jury found that police and emergency services were to blame for Britain's worst sports disaster.\nThe jury exonerated the behavior of the crowd, saying it did not contribute to the tragedy at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, England, and that the victims were "unlawfully killed."\nRelatives who had waged a tireless campaign to protect the reputation of their loved ones leapt to their feet outside a specially built courtroom, cheering and weeping, when the verdicts were announced. They chanted, "Justice for the 96!" and sang the Liverpool soccer club's anthem, "You'll Never Walk Alone."\nThe original inquest recorded verdicts of accidental death, something the families of the victims refused to accept. Those verdicts were overturned in 2012 after a far-reaching inquiry into the disaster that examined previously secret documents and exposed the wrongdoing and mistakes by police.\nHooliganism was rife in English soccer throughout the 1980s, and there were immediate attempts to assign blame on the Liverpool fans and defend the policing operation. A false narrative that blamed drunken, ticketless and rowdy Liverpool fans was created by police and spread by a lawmaker in Sheffield.\n"The disgrace is that we've been faced by police slander upon slander, insult upon insult," said Hillsborough campaigner Trevor Hicks, who lost two daughters in the crush. "Now, truth has won out."\nThe Hillsborough tragedy unfolded on April 15, 1989, when more than 2,000 Liverpool fans were allowed to flood into a standing-room section behind a goal with the 54,000-capacity stadium already nearly full for the match against Nottingham Forest.\nThe victims were smashed against metal anti-riot fences or trampled underfoot, and many suffocated. A police officer ran onto the field and asked the referee to halt the game, which was abandoned after six minutes. Fans and rescue workers ripped up advertising boards and used them as makeshift stretchers as police and first-aid workers treated victims on the field.\nDavid Duckenfield, who was then the South Yorkshire police chief superintendent in charge of policing the game, testified at the inquests that he told a "terrible lie" by saying fans had rushed through gates into the stadium, rather than admitting to authorizing the gates to be opened.\nThe jury found Duckenfield was in breach of his duty of care to fans and that his actions amounted to "gross negligence." It concluded unanimously that police-planning errors "caused or contributed" to the situation that led to the crush, and it confirmed the behavior of fans did not cause or contribute to the tragedy.\nJurors also criticized the actions of the emergency services at the game, saying there was a "lack of coordination, command and control which delayed or prevented appropriate responses."\nThey also found that the construction and layout of the stadium was dangerous and contributed to the disaster. The Sheffield Wednesday soccer club, which owns Hillsborough, should have done more to detect unsafe or unsatisfactory features of the venue, the jury said.\n"I knew the truth 27 years ago, just came here to hear it confirmed," said Gary Spencer, 51, who attended the game and was outside the courtroom. The verdicts capped the more than two-year inquests, the longest in British legal history.\nBy the end of 2016, police plan to conclude a separate criminal investigation into wrongdoing by authorities in the disaster. Prosecutors said they will "formally consider whether any criminal charges should be brought against any individual or corporate body."\nAfter the jury's decision, the police force said "we unequivocally accept the verdict," and apologized to the families for their failings.\n"I want to see accountability for all the things that have been done to the families down the years," said British lawmaker Andy Burnham. "That means prosecution, not just for the failings on the day but the cover-up that followed. People will never recover from it."\nPrime Minister David Cameron called the verdicts a "landmark moment in the quest for justice."\nThe Hillsborough disaster prompted a sweeping modernization of stadiums across England and also transformed inadequate policing. In the immediate aftermath, plans were being made to renovate the top division stadiums into safer, all-seat venues, with fences around fields torn down.\n"The Hillsborough disaster changed the way in which major sporting events are policed and many lessons have been learned as a result," South Yorkshire Police Chief Constable David Crompton said. "Today with improvements in training, communication and technology it's almost impossible to imagine how the same set of circumstances could arise again."\nMargaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son, James, died at Hillsborough, said the disaster helped bring about changes "hopefully for the good of other people."\n"That's the legacy the 96 left," she said.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

He dismissed his client's influence on terrorists, calling Abdeslam "more a follower than a leader."\nThe suspect's lawyer in France,?Frank Berton,?told iTele TV his client wants to talk, "he has things to say, that he wants to explain his route to radicalization" as well as his role in the attacks -- but not take responsibility for others.\n"That means be judged for facts and acts that he committed but not for what he did not commit simply because he is the only survivor of the attacks," Berton said.\nInvestigating judges in France were set to decide how to charge Abdeslam. Prosecutors said he was instrumental in coordinating logistics for the Nov. 13 attacks that killed 130 people at Paris night clubs, a noted music hall and the sports stadium outside the city. The Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility for the carnage.\nPolice arrested Abdeslam in Belgium last month after he spent four months on the run.\nFatalities from Terrorist Attacks in France | FindTheData\nThe quick, secret transfer to France surprised even Berton, who rushed from Lille to join his client at the Palace of Justice, arriving in the early afternoon.\nTestimony from Abdeslam, a 26-year-old Frenchman of Moroccan origin, will likely prove significant to definitively linking events of that night, which involved three teams of attackers who blew themselves up or sprayed gunfire. His brother was one of the suicide bombers.\nAbdeslam's precise role in the attacks remains a mystery. He returned from France to Belgium afterward, calling cohorts in Brussels to fetch him. However, a suicide belt bearing his fingerprints was found south of Paris and a car he had been driving was found in a northern Paris district, prosecutors said.\nHe was captured just four days before March 22 bombings at the Brussels airport and a metro station that killed 32 people. ISIS also claimed responsibility for those attacks.\nBrussels, and in particular the Molenbeek neighborhood with a large Muslim population, was home to many of the attackers who struck Paris. It was Abdeslam's childhood neighborhood and he was finally caught not far from the home where he grew up.\nSpeculation about Abdeslam's role and place in the hierarchy of the attackers has been rampant. Was he a little guy and a coward or a pivotal figure in the planning and execution of the attacks?\nIt had been widely suspected that Abdeslam pulled out of his own role as an attacker, something Paris prosecutor Francois Molins confirmed at a news conference, saying he had wanted to blow himself up at the sports stadium but backed down.\nAbdeslam is charged with attempted murder over a March 15 shootout with police in Brussels. He was arrested three days later and police in Belgium have questioned him about any potential links to the suicide bombers in the Brussels attacks.\nFrench Justice Minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas said Abdeslam would be placed in isolation in a prison in the Paris region, watched by guards specially trained to deal with "people reputed to be dangerous." He did not name the prison where Abdeslam would be housed.\nBerton, who has taken on tough cases in the past, said in the iTele interview that Abdeslam "has the right to be defended."\n"We're in a democracy ... we're not in a totalitarian state," Berton said.\nFormer chief terror magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguiere said that while Abdeslam's arrival in France is important, the investigation is far from over.\n"What is important is not just his declarations," Bruguiere said on iTele, "but to be confronted with concrete elements of the probe, a very thick file."\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Security Council briefing. â€œNow I see parties reverting to the langue of a military solution or military option. We must ensure they do not see that as a solution or an option.â€?\nDe Mistura said heâ€™s urging the leaders of the U.S. and Russia to intervene because both presidentsâ€™ legacies are â€œlinked to the success of what has been a unique initiative which started very well.â€?\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov largely spearheaded the current effort to end the five-year Syrian conflict.\nDe Mistura appealed not only for U.S.-Russia intervention but for international support, calling in the Security Council briefing for another ministerial meeting of the International Syria Support Group "lest we lose the window of opportunity to reverse the negative downward spiral."\nThe International Syria Support Group includes 17 countries as well as the United Nations, Arab League, European Union and Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\nDe Mistura said he hoped that the talks would resume in May, and he predicted the overall process would continue as previously planned through July. But he stopped short of setting a specific date, point to the recent surge in fighting, notably in and around Aleppo.\nAccording to Reuters, the opposition group ? High Negotiations Committee ? pulled out of formal talks a week ago in protest of the intensified fighting and the slow response for aid deliveries.\nBashar Jaâ€™afari, who led the government delegation, said Tuesday the latest round of talks were â€œuseful and constructive,â€? but gave no sign of giving into the oppositionâ€™s demands of forming a new government without President Assad.\nLamenting the worsening violence, he said that "in the last 48 hours, we have had an average of one Syrian killed every 25 minutes, one Syrian wounded every 13 minutes ... How can you have substantial talks when you have only news about bombing and shelling?"\nSpeaking at the end of a third session of Syria peace talks this year, de Mistura said the truce brokered by the U.S. and Russia had pulled off a "miracle" by sharply reducing violence in March, but acknowledged that the renewed fighting has put the cessation of hostilities "in great danger."\nHe called for a "U.S.-Russian initiative at the highest level" to help reinforce it.\n"There is no reason that both of them ? who have been putting so much political capital in that success story and have a common interest in not seeing Syria ending up in another cycle of war ? should not be able to revitalize what they created, and which is still alive, but barely," he said of the two countries.\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said he shared de Misturaâ€™s concerns and urged Russia to press the Assad regime â€œto fulfill its commitments.â€?\nThe talks floundered last week after the Western- and Saudi-backed opposition called the High Negotiating Committee suspended formal participation in the indirect talks with Assad's envoys to protest alleged government cease-fire violations, a drop in humanitarian aid deliveries and no progress in winning the release of detainees in Syria.\nDe Mistura suggested back-channel work between Moscow and Washington was already under way to help the truce, and that a revival of it would help bring the two sides back to the table.\n"I know that both the Russian Federation and the U.S. are talking among themselves on how to salvage on what has been actually a remarkable success ? but needs to be sustained," he said, referring to the cease-fire. If it is revived, he predicted: "It will not be difficult for everyone to come back around the table."\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n	foxnews	World

The carnage in Aleppo was particularly intense on Wednesday and Thursday, when airstrikes and artillery killed dozens of people, including patients and one of Syria's last pediatricians at a Doctors Without Borders-supported hospital.\nAid agencies warned that the contested northern city is on the brink of a humanitarian disaster with the collapse of a two-month cease-fire and stalled peace talks in Switzerland.

The UN envoy for Syria and the lead opposition negotiator have urged the U.S. and Russia to step in and take control of peace talks as a fragile truce hangs in the balance.\nThe truce between Syrian President Bashar Assad and the U.S.-backed moderate rebels was called in February with the help of the U.S. and Russia.\nThis week, fierce bombing has ramped up with heavy civilian casualties, including the bombing of a Doctors Without Borders hospital that killed one of the last pediatricians left in the country. However, Russia has resisted calls to pressure Assad to stop his bombing campaign.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross warned that the intensification of fighting threatens to cause a humanitarian disaster for millions of people. A statement issued late Friday said four medical facilities on both sides of the city were hit earlier that day, including a dialysis center and a cardiac hospital. ICRC appealed to all parties in the conflict "for an immediate halt in the attacks."\n"There can be no justification for these appalling acts of violence deliberately targeting hospitals and clinics, which are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law," said Marianne Gasser, head of the ICRC in Syria. "People keep dying in these attacks. There is no safe place anymore in Aleppo."\n"For the sake of people in Aleppo, we call for all to stop this indiscriminate violence," Gasser said.\nKerry is planning to talk with UN envoy Staffan de Mistura in Geneva Sunday along with Saudi and Jordanian foreign ministers. Aleppo was left out of the original â€œcessation of hostilitiesâ€? agreement that included the Latakia and Eastern Ghouta regions.\nAccording to the AFP, Kerry has expressed â€œdeep concernâ€? about Aleppo to de Mistura and Riad Hijab ? the chief negotiator for the High Negations Committee.\nSyria Overview | FindTheData\nThe secretary made clear that ending violence in Aleppo and returning ultimately to a durable, nationwide cessation is a top priority, State Department spokesman John Kirby said.\nKerry dismissed Russian claims that airstrikes are targeting the Nusra Front in Aleppo and instead claiming civilian lives.\nâ€œThe Assad regime continues to escalate the conflict by predominantly targeting innocent civilians and parties to the cessation of hostilities ? not Nusra, as the regime falsely claims,â€? Kirby said. â€œSuch attacks are direct violations of the cessation and must stop immediately.\nAleppo has suffered some of the worst fighting in the Syrian conflict. Fighting in the civil war has clamed more than 270,000 people.\nIn neighboring Lebanon's capital, Beirut, more than 100 people marched in the city center to protest Syrian government attacks, mainly those on Aleppo, calling them "war crimes." Lebanon is split between supporters and opponents of the rebellion against Assad.\nIn Damascus, ICRC spokesman Pawel Krzysiek said that despite the difficult situation in Aleppo, which hinders humanitarian operations in the city, aid deliveries elsewhere continued. Humanitarian convoys entered separate areas besieged by rebels and government forces, he said.\nThe convoys, a joint operation between the ICRC, the United Nations and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, began delivering aid to Madaya and Zabadani ? two mountain resorts near Damascus that have been besieged by government forces.\nKrzysiek added that 20 other trucks entered the northwestern villages of Foua and Kfarya, which are being besieged by insurgents.\nThe ICRC delivers food parcels and wheat flour, medicines, bed nets, crutches and anti-lice shampoo to all locations, he said.\nThe U.N.

He said progress was being made toward an understanding on how to reduce the violence in Aleppo but that more work was needed.\n"There are several proposals that are now going back to key players to sign off," Kerry said after meeting de Mistura. We are hopeful but we are not there yet... we are going to work very hard in the next 24 hours, 48 hours to get there."\nHe did not say what the proposals were, adding that he would telephone Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov later Monday and that de Mistura was headed to Moscow on Tuesday for talks.\nHe said the United States and Russia have agreed that there will be additional personnel stationed in Geneva around the clock to make sure there is more accountability and a better ability to enforce the cessation of hostilities on a day-to-day basis.\nSpeaking later to staff at the U.S. mission in Geneva, Kerry said he hoped that an agreement about Aleppo could be announced within the next few days.\nFor Aleppo, the U.S. is considering drawing up with the Russians a detailed map that would lay out "safe zones." Civilians and members of moderate opposition groups covered by the truce could find shelter from persistent attacks by Assad's military, which claims to be targeting terrorists. One U.S. official said "hard lines" would delineate specific areas and neighborhoods. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Russia would accept such a plan or if Moscow could persuade the Assad government to respect the prospective zones. Some U.S. officials are skeptical of the chances for success, but also note that it is worth a try to at least reduce the violence.\nU.S. officials also say the safe zones will not be "no-fly zones" per se. However, details, such as the locations of those, have not yet been agreed to and these issues will be discussed by Kerry and Lavrov in a phone call later Monday, as well as by Lavrov and de Mistura in Moscow.\nEarlier, al-Jubeir called the situation in Aleppo with continued airstrikes an "outrage" and a criminal violation of humanitarian law. He said that Syrian President Bashar Assad would be held accountable for the attacks and would be removed from power either through a political process or by force.\n"There is only one side that is flying airplanes, and that is Bashar al-Assad and his allies, so they are responsible for the massacre of women, children, and the elderly," he said. "They are responsible for the murder of doctors and medical personnel, and this situation, any way you slice it, will not stand.

(? Justin Ng)\nEditor's note: The Slooh Community Observatory will offer a free webcast of the Eta Aquarid meteor shower on May 5-6. To watch it, you can join Slooh here or visit:? Eta Aquarid Meteor Shower Webcast from Slooh\nIf you missed out on seeing Halley's Comet during its last Earth flyby in 1986, don't despair ? you can spot tiny pieces of the icy wanderer overhead this week.\nDusty debris that Halley's Comet has shed on its 75-year-long laps around the sun slams into Earth's atmosphere during the first week of May every year, creating an annual meteor shower known as the Eta Aquarids . (Another Halley-spawned shower, the Orionids, occurs every October.)\nThe Eta Aquarids are usually the yearâ€™s richest meteor shower for Southern Hemisphere observers, but north of the equator it's one of the more difficult annual displays to observe.\nThis year, the shower will peak in the predawn hours Thursday and Friday (May 5 and May 6). From mid-northern latitudes, the radiant ??the spot in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate ? rises at about 1:30 a.m. local daylight time, scarcely 2 hours before morning twilight begins to interfere.?\nAt peak activity, observers at 26 degrees north latitude ? that's around Brownsville, Texas or the Florida Keys ? should be able to see about a dozen Eta Aquarid meteors , provided viewing conditions are good. But that number falls to practically zero north of 40 degrees (the latitude of New York City).\nYou might catch an Earthgrazer\nBut don't give up hope if you live north of New York City. You still have the chance to see a very special kind of meteor ? an Earthgrazer.??\nEarthgrazers skim the top of Earth's atmosphere like a stone skipping across the surface of a pond. They appear when the radiant of a meteor shower is near the horizon, and meteoroids streak horizontally overhead rather than down through the sky.\nEarthgrazers are rare; an hour of watching might produce one or two at most, but that's plenty. These meteors are sometimes colorful and gracefully slow, and people who are lucky enough to see one talk about it for years.?\nDuring the 2001 Leonid meteor shower , I was stationed just outside of Benson, Arizona, and caught sight of an Earthgrazer. It bolted straight up out of the northeast and took about 10 seconds to traverse nearly the entire sky, passing almost directly over my head in the process.\nThe meteor did not leave a streak or trail; rather, it appeared as a small, white glowing ball. I felt like an outfielder at a baseball game watching a home run sail right over my head.\nLooking for Earthgrazers is simple: Spread a blanket on the ground, lie down and look up. A reclining lawn chair facing southeast works just as well. Eta Aquarid Earthgrazers streak overhead, flying generally southeast to northwest.\nThe Eta Aquarids remain active at about one-half peak strength for a couple of days before and after the maximum. Conditions this year are excellent; the moon is absent from the predawn sky for more than a week around maximum.\nEditor's note:?If you snap an awesome photo of an Eta Aquarid meteor or any other celestial sight and would like to share it with Space.com and our news partners for a story or gallery, send images and comments in to managing editor Tariq Malik at spacephotos@space.com .\n?\n	foxnews	U.S.

According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of fundraising data provided by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the former secretary of state received 53 percent of the donations from Wall Street in March, up from 32 percent last year and 33 percent in January through February, as the nominating contests began.\nThe analysis of campaign-finance reports shows that some Wall Street donors have shifted their financial support from Republican candidates who dropped out of the race, such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, to Clinton in recent months.\nTrump, by contrast, hasnâ€™t garnered more than 1 percent of Wall Street contributions in any month through March.\nTo be sure, it is still early in the general election money race, and Trump hasnâ€™t aggressively pursued the finance sector for funds so far. He self-financed about three-quarters of his primary campaign and said last week that he planned to more actively solicit donations for the general election in order to keep pace with Clinton.\n	foxnews	U.S.

It began with Donald Trump winning the GOP race with a bang, thumping Ted Cruz in Indiana, a state many thought Cruz would carry. But Trump couldnâ€™t let the contest conclude without implying that Cruzâ€™s father was involved in JFKâ€™s assassination. Also, Bernie Sanders upset Hillary Clinton by five points in the Hoosier State, which the RealClearPolitics average suggested sheâ€™d carry by seven. ?\nThe week ended with a weak jobs report ? 160,000 jobs in April, well below last yearâ€™s monthly average of 229,000. We donâ€™t know whether this and a lower labor force participation rate are just blips or evidence of a slowdown. Still, neither is helpful to Democrats when 40 percent of Americans already believe the country is in recession.\nIs Team Clinton preparing for a loss in the FBI primary? The defense it mounted after CNN reported Thursday that the FBI has interviewed top Clinton aides, some more than once, suggests so.\nFirst, neither the FBI nor career Justice Department officials supervising the investigation are likely to be talking. So the sourcing ? â€œU.S. officials briefed on the investigationâ€? ?? points to political appointees willing to help their partyâ€™s frontrunner lay down a smokescreen.\nThere was the declaration that â€œinvestigators haven't found evidence to prove that Clinton willfully violated the law,â€? again attributed to â€œU.S. officials.â€? Claiming Clinton didnâ€™t â€œintentionallyâ€? or â€œwillfullyâ€? violate the law is meaningless. She need only have acted with gross negligence, disregarding known or easily anticipated risks.?\n2016 Election Headquarters\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage â†’\nThe statement that the probe hasnâ€™t expanded beyond handling of classified materials is untrue. Since January, there have been reports the FBI is investigating possible official actions linked to contributions to the Clinton Foundation revealed by the emails.\nSounds to me like Team Clinton wanted to get in front of the coverage by suggesting harmless, unintentional mistakes may have been made, but nothing serious. But the CNN report that prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginiaâ€™s office are involved suggests a tie to the Romanian hacker Guccifer, who was extradited to the Eastern District. It is also the venue where the government would stand a better chance of securing a conviction, as compared with other plausible venues ? Southern District of New York (which covers Chappaqua, where the server was in the Clintonâ€™s basement) or the District of Columbia (where Clinton and her staff worked).\nBern is on a roll. Polls now point to him winning West Virginia on Tuesday, despite Hillaryâ€™s attempt last week to disavow her joyous declaration at an Ohio town hall that â€œWe are going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.â€? Sanders would, too, but heâ€™s smart enough not to be open about it.\nWith a rally Sunday in New Jersey and others in Sacramento on Monday, Salem, Ore., on Tuesday and Missoula and Billings, Mont., on Wednesday, Sanders is not going away. He appears to be sharpening his convention demands, raising objections to how the Rules and Resolutions Committees are selected and toughening his language on Clintonâ€™s Wall Street ties. This could indicate heâ€™ll seek to end superdelegates and demand tough anti-Wall Street planks pleasing to the Democratic Partyâ€™s Elizabeth Warren wing.\nTwo quick pivots. Trump celebrated his ascension as the GOPâ€™s presumptive nominee by reversing course. First, he flipped from opposing a national minimum wage increase in the November Fox Business debate to supporting one now.\nThen, after celebrating for months that he was self-funding his campaign (tweeting as recently as March 15 that he was â€œthe ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!â€?), Trump said on â€œMorning Joeâ€? after Indiana, â€œDo I want to sell a couple of buildings and self-fund? I donâ€™t know that I want to do that necessarily.â€? He then hired a finance director. Itâ€™s late to gin up a fundraising effort; heâ€™ll probably still have to dump hundreds of millions of his money into the campaign, as well as explain the switch.\nParty unity. Indiana guaranteed Trump the nomination, but not unity. As Republicans struggle to unify, maybe Trump should avoid saying of the GOP, as he did in an interview Sunday on ABC, â€œI think it would be better if it were unified, I think there would be something good about it, but I donâ€™t actually think it has to be unified.â€? The more he says the party need not be unified, the less likely it will be.\nA smarter approach would be to project confidence and humility by saying, â€œThere are two months until the convention and six months until the election. Iâ€™m confident I can bring the party together,â€? then spell out his agenda. Trumpâ€™s agenda won him victory. That and opposition to Clinton are what can bring about unity, a necessary condition for victory in November.\nKarl Rove joined Fox News Channel as a political contributor in February 2008.

Pat McCrory with legal action of its own.\nIn a suit filed late Monday in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, the DOJ alleged a â€œpattern or practice of employment discrimination on the basis of sexâ€? against the state over the law requiring transgender people to use bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate.\nâ€œThey created state-sponsored discrimination against transgender individuals,â€? Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a press conference late Monday afternoon. ?\nThe suit was filed after McCrory, in his lawsuit, accused the administration of a â€œbaseless and blatant overreachâ€? in trying to get the policy scrapped.\n?\nStatus of "Bathroom Bill" Legislation | InsideGov\nMcCrory, speaking at his own press conference, said Congress should get involved and â€œbring clarityâ€? to federal anti-discrimination provisions ? but urged the court to intervene in the current dispute, in the meantime.?\nâ€œThis is not just a North Carolina issue, this is now a national issue,â€? he said. â€œWe believe a court rather than a federal agency should tell our state, our nation and employers across the country what the law requires.â€??\nIn an "On The Record" interview Monday night with Fox News' Greta Van Sustern, McCrory pointed at the federal government needing to get involved to make clear rules for states on the legal definition of gender identity.\n"The U.S. Congress kind of ignored it, and now the Obama administration is interpreting existing law," he said.\n"I think frankly Congress needs to deal with this to have a consistent message throughout the United States," he added.\nThe state had faced a DOJ-imposed Monday deadline?to respond to its demand that North Carolina either scrap the law or face legal action and risk losing federal funds.?Lynch said Monday that as the case moves forward, they â€œretain the option of curtailing federal fundingâ€? to the state Department of Public Safety and University of North Carolina.?\nThe state law also limits state anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and blocks local governments from establishing their own. House Bill 2 has been criticized by gay rights groups, and entertainers including Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam have canceled shows. PayPal reversed plans to open a 400-employee operation center in Charlotte, and Deutsche Bank froze expansion plans near Raleigh.\nNearly 200 corporate leaders from across the country, including Charlotte-based Bank of America, have urged the law's repeal, arguing it's bad for business because it makes recruiting talented employees more difficult.\nSeveral other states have proposed similar laws in recent months limiting protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi sued that state over a law that will allow workers to cite their own religious objections to same-sex marriage to deny services to people.\nMcCrory says the North Carolina law applies only to government offices, universities and road-side rest stops, not every bathroom in the state.\nThe Justice Department, though, had sent McCrory a letter last Wednesday stating the law violates federal civil rights laws.\nThe governor, speaking over the weekend with â€œFox News Sunday,â€? said he asked the department for an extension and was given only until the close of business Monday.\nâ€œI donâ€™t think that three working days is enough time for such a pretty big threat,â€? he told Fox News. "Itâ€™s the federal government being a bully, making law.â€?\nMcCrory also said he doesnâ€™t have the legal authority to change laws and that the expectation that he can is â€œunrealistic.â€? ?\nMcCrory, who signed the bill into law in March, said last week that the department seems to be breaking new ground in claiming the North?Carolina law violates Civil Rights Act protections against discrimination in education and the workplace.\nAnd he said the administration's warning means the issue is no longer confined to North?Carolina.\nâ€œThis is not just North Carolina,â€? said McCrory, arguing that every university that accepts federal funding is now in the same situation as those in his state.\nMeanwhile, the administration is expected to soon take the bathroom issue further, to ensure that transgender student rights are fully protected under federal law, according to Politico. The move reportedly would be related to a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities, and multiple agencies are expected to be involved.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Lawrence guided-missile destroyer awaits refueling from a tanker in Coronado, Calif. (AP)\nThe Pentagon announced Tuesday that it had sent a warship near a disputed reef in the South China Sea, representing a new warning to China over Beijing's territorial claims in the region.?\nThe Wall Street Journal , citing a senior defense official, reported that the USS William P. Lawrence, a guided-missile destroyer, navigated within 12 nautical miles of Fiery Cross reef, part of the Spratly chain of islands. The Defense Department, in a statement quoted by Reuters , said the operation was to "challenge excessive maritime claims of some claimants in the South China Sea".\nThe official told the Journal that the Lawrence took one pass past Fiery Cross Reef in a routine operation. It was not immediately clear whether Chinese military or civilian officials attempted to make contact with the ship.\nThere was no immediate comment from Beijing.?\nTuesday marked the third time in less than a year the U.S. had conducted a so-called freedom of navigation operation in the South China Sea.\nChinese officials have insisted that they have no plans to militarize the Spratly Islands. China President Xi Jianping made a pledge to that effect when he visited the White House in September.\nHowever,?China landed civilian jets on Fiery Cross reef in January to test a new 10,000 foot runway, a move seen as more evidence that Beijing is increasing its military presence in the region.?\nIslands Disputed in the South China Sea | Graphiq\nIn February,?Adm. Harry Harris, commander of U.S. Pacific Command, told Congress that China was clearly militarizing its South China Sea claims, saying, "You would have to believe in a flat earth to think otherwise."?\nThough China's claims have drawn the most attention, the Journal reports that Tuesday's operation, known as an "innocent passage" was technically meant to counter ccompeting claims by Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines.\nIn addition to the warship operations, the U.S. Air Force?sent A-10 warthog attack planes close to Scarborough Shoal, a move which led Beijing to accuse the U.S. of inflaming tensions in the region.\nThe Pentagon is concerned about China's recent surveying of Scarborough Shoal, which sits just 150 miles west of the Philippines. That makes it the closest group of contested islands to any US ally.\nAdm. John Richardson, chief of naval operations, told a Council on Foreign Relations forum last week that the Navy's freedom of navigation operations ? sailing warships close to Chinese man-made islands ? are working. Their aim is to advocate for an international set of rules that ensures the free flow of goods and services in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, he said.\n"They don't extend beyond that. There's just a pure advocacy for that system. So we design those very carefully. It's a policy decision that is made, interwoven with those other elements of power. So I think both aircraft, ships are ready to execute those as they fit into the plan," he said.\nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n	foxnews	World

(Reuters)\nAs research unfolds, we learn more and more about the damaging effects that the Zika virus has on the developing brain, and the danger it poses to couples trying to conceive. We also know that it has been linked to another paralyzing disease in adults called Guillain-Barre, and that there is currently no vaccine or cure for Zika.\nIn addition to the 4,759 Zika-linked microcephaly cases in Brazil, the virus has raised hell in areas of the Caribbean and Latin America, where active outbreaks have been reported in 45 countries and territories. While the virus is typically spread through the bite of an infected female mosquito, we now have confirmed cases of transmission through sexual contact.\nSimply put, this virus cannot be overlooked.\nBut while thousands of Americans have smartly reconsidered their vacation plans to Zika-afflicted regions, and the MLB wisely canceled a two-game series to be held in Zika-ravaged Puerto Rico, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), as recently as this week, has insisted that the 2016 Summer Games will go on as scheduled in the Zika hotbed of Rio.\nBefore we were even concerned about Zika affecting our athletes, alarms were sounded over the poor conditions and polluted waters of Brazil, and the countryâ€™s inability to address these issues. Plans were made for a fleet of boats to patrol the waters to keep trash and debris from floating into the paths of competing sailors, but that doesnâ€™t speak to the untreated human waste that mars the countryâ€™s beautiful beaches. But Brazil has been plagued by economic woes, so who is to say that the funding for these contingency plans will actually be kept in place?\nOn Thursday, the countryâ€™s senators voted to impeach President Dilma Rousseff over corruption and economic failures, adding to the instability just months before Augustâ€™s Opening Ceremonies. I canâ€™t say for sure, because I have not seen it firsthand, but I would be surprised if, at a time like this, the countryâ€™s health remains a top priority. There is no longer a leader to promise us our athletes and spectators will be protected, and there is no strong voice to ensure that the Zika protocols are being enforced. In February, Rio's organizing committee announced plans to protect our athletes during their stay by charging them up to $100 for a mosquito net to be affixed to their rooms.?\nIn responding to a call by a Canadian health professor to postpone or move the games, International Olympic Committee (IOC) medical director Richard Budgett said that the committee would continue to monitor the situation closely, but the games are still scheduled to start August 5.

(AP)\nVenezuela is descending into a deepening crisis that could end in violence, including the possibility of a coup against that countryâ€™s embattled leftist government, senior U.S. intelligence officials said Friday.\nThere is a â€œpotential for real violence,â€? one of two officials said in a briefing with a small group of reporters. â€œItâ€™s hard for me to see how this ends easily.â€?\nThe officials, who have extensive experience in the region, said that they and others in the intelligence community increasingly believe that President NicolÃ¡s Maduro could be removed from office, either in a â€œpalace coupâ€? led by associates close to him or in a military uprising. They said that the possibility of an overthrow or street violence is of concern to American officials, who want to avoid anarchy in an oil-rich country just a three-hour flight from Miami.\nâ€œThe goal is to mitigate the crisis that theyâ€™re experiencing,â€? said the official. â€œItâ€™s in the United Statesâ€™ interest that Venezuela not bottom out.â€?\nHe said, however, that Washingtonâ€™s options are limited because of Mr. Maduroâ€™s antipathy toward the U.S., which he frequently blames for orchestrating â€œan economic warâ€? designed to destabilize his government.\nâ€œThe more the United States intervenes,â€? he said, â€œthe more weâ€™re the problem.â€?\nVenezuelaâ€™s information ministry and Mr. Maduroâ€™s office didnâ€™t respond to requests seeking comment. But the president on Friday said that he was declaring what he called a state of exception and economic emergency to deal with both the economic crisis and threats against his rule.\nMr. Maduro didnâ€™t detail what the decreeâ€™s reach would be, but he said the decree gives him the power to repair the economy and â€œneutralize and defeat the external foreign aggression that has been initiated against our country.â€? He didn't provide evidence of threats Venezuela faces nor did he elaborate on the measures he might take with his new powers.\nU.S. officials have been closely following the growing degradation in Venezuela, characterized by acute shortages of basic foods and medicines, which doctors say has caused deaths that could have been easily prevented. Rolling blackouts and electricity rationing keep much of the country in the dark for hours on end.? With foreign reserves running low, imports have fallen hard.\nVenezuelan government officials are concerned the discontent could lead unnamed people to move against Mr. Maduro, who has ruled for three years, the intelligence officials said.\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing the government concernedâ€? about an overthrow, the second intelligence official said. â€œTheyâ€™re paranoid about the question of a coup.â€?\nMr. Maduro also faces the possibility of a recall referendum, which the opposition has pledged to stage, as permitted in the constitution.\nThe intelligence officials, though, say the president is trying to delay the validation of signatures to trigger a referendum until next year. A recall then would only remove Mr. Maduro, with the rest of his term to be finished by his vice president. If the vote takes place this year, not only would Mr. Maduro be out of a job, but new elections would be called, a far better scenario for the opposition.\n	foxnews	World

He flew home early Saturday and declared the coup to have failed.\n"They have pointed the people's guns against the people. The president, whom 52 percent of the people brought to power, is in charge. This government brought to power by the people is in charge," Erdogan told large crowds after landing at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport.\nGovernment officials blamed the coup attempt on a U.S.-based moderate Islamic cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Erdogan has often accused the cleric and his supporters of attempting to overthrow the government. Gulen lives in exile in Pennsylvania and promotes a philosophy that blends a mystical form of Islam with staunch advocacy of democracy, education, science and interfaith dialogue.\nGulen, however, said he condemned "in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey" and sharply rejected any responsibility for the attempted coup.\nStill, the government pressed ahead Saturday with a purge of judicial officials, with 2,745 judges being dismissed across Turkey for alleged ties to Gulen. Ten members of Turkey's highest administrative court were detained and arrest warrants were issued for 48 administrative court members and 140 members of Turkey's appeals court, state media reported.\nAfter a Turkish military helicopter landed in Greece Saturday after sending a distress signal, the Turkish goverment demanded the prompt return of eight â€˜treacherous officersâ€™ on board the aircraft.\nThe eight were arrested in Greece for entering the country illegaly and were identified as two majors, a captain and five privates by Anadolu Agency, a state-run news organization.\nAfter landing on Greek soil, they requested political asylum and Greek officials said they would consider the request. The officials also said they would return the helicopter to Turkey "as soon as possible."\nThe coup attempt was swift and came as a surprise to allies in the region. Forces loyal to Erdogan put down the coup attempt in a night of explosions, air battles and gunfire.\nErdogan vowed that those responsible "will pay a heavy price for their treason."\nNTV television aired footage of a Turkish colonel and other soldiers being taken into custody at military headquarters.\nThe video shows them being hand-searched by special forces police, their hands behind their heads. Some are later seen kneeling on the ground, their hands still held behind their heads.\nAccording to Hurriyet newspaper's online edition, some of the privates who were detained told interrogators they were not aware that they were part of a coup attempt. They had been told by commanders they were taking part in military maneuvers. Some said they understood that it was a coup attempt when they saw civilians climb on tanks.\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) | FindTheData\nMilitary chief of staff Gen. Hulusi Akar was overseeing is taking the operation against the coup plotters, CNN-Turk said.\nThe coup attempt began late Friday, with a statement from the military saying it had seized control "to reinstall the constitutional order, democracy, human rights and freedoms, to ensure that the rule of law once again reigns in the country, for law and order to be reinstated."\nFighter jets buzzed overhead, gunfire erupted outside military headquarters and vehicles blocked two major bridges in Istanbul. Soldiers backed by tanks blocked entry to Istanbul's airport for a couple of hours before being overtaken by pro-government crowds carrying Turkish flags, according to footage broadcast by the Dogan news agency.\nBut the military did not appear unified, as top commanders went on television to condemn the action and order troops back to their barracks.\nFighting continued into the early morning, with the sounds of huge blasts echoing across Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, including at least one bomb that hit the parliament complex. Television footage showed images of broken glass and other debris strewn across a lobby leading to the assembly hall.\nIn Washington, a statement from the White House said President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry agreed that both sides "should support the democratically elected government of Turkey, show restraint and avoid any violence or bloodshed."\nA senior Defense Department official told Fox News that the unrest was having "no impact" on anti-ISIS missions flown out of Incirlik Air Base in southeastern Turkey.\nSoldiers with tanks in Ankara streets.

The statement from representatives of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim communities declares "our great sorrow over the terrorist attacks that disturb the peace of our great nation and of the world."\nErdogan made his way to the Ataturk airport early Saturday and spoke to the crowds that gathered to greet him.\n"They have pointed the people's guns against the people.

Cook also confirmed that Turkey had halted all military flights out of the base, including those by its own jets.\nThe Pentagon said it was trying to get permission to resume air operations from the base, while adjusting mission operations in the meantime.\nMeanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to his Turkish counterpart,?Mevlut Cavosoglu, for the second time in as many days following the attempted takeover, that left at least 265 people dead and 1,400 wounded.\nDespite the support for Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government by the Obama administration during the coup, the country's labor minister suggested Washington was behind the uprising. Meanwhile, Erdogan himself bluntly requested the extradition of Pennsylvania-based cleric?Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan blamed for inspiring the coup, saying, "If we are strategic partners, then you should bring about our request."\nAlthough he didn't outline any threat, Erdogan's emphasis on U.S.-Turkish counterterrorism cooperation raised the prospect of a prolonged closure of Incirlik if he didn't get his way.\nStung by the criticism, the State Department fired back. In a readout of the telephone call between Kerry and Cavosoglu, the department said Kerry told his fellow diplomat, "public insinuations or claims about any role by the United States in the failed coup attempt are utterly false and harmful to our bilateral relations."\nKerry reiterated U.S. support for Turkey's democratically elected government, according to the State Department readout, and urged authorities to respect the rule of law and safeguard civilian life as they respond to the coup attempt. Kerry also said Turkey needed to respect due process as it investigates those it believes were involved in the plot.\nEarlier, on a visit to Luxembourg, Kerry told reporters the U.S. would entertain an extradition request for Gulen if the Turks provided evidence of wrongdoing. Erdogan has long accused Gulen, a former ally, of trying to overthrow the government, but Washington has never found the claims compelling.\n"We fully anticipate that there will be questions raised about Mr. Gulen," Kerry told reporters. "And obviously we would invite the government of Turkey, as we always do, to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny. And the United States will accept that and look at it and make judgments about it appropriately."\nA Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government regulations, said Turkey was preparing a formal extradition request with detailed information about Gulen's involvement in illegal activities. He said the coup attempt was seen as "one more thing to add to an already extensive list."\nIn a statement, Gulen said he condemned, "in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey" and sharply rejected any responsibility or knowledge of who might be involved.\nKerry said the U.S. had no indication beforehand of the coup attempt, which began as he and Russia's foreign minister were in a Russian government villa in Moscow, locked in negotiations over Syria.\n"If you're planning a coup, you don't exactly advertise to your partners in NATO," Kerry said. "So it surprised everyone. It does not appear to be a very brilliantly planned or executed event."\nLate Saturday, the State Department also issued a new travel warning, suggesting U.S. citizens "reconsider travel to Turkey at this time."\nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Some 6,000 detentions have taken place. The number could surpass 6,000."\nDetention orders were for 53 more judges and prosecutors while 52 military officers were rounded up for their alleged roles in the failed coup, Turkey's?state-run Anadolu news agency reported.\nBozdag also said he was confident that the United States would return Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen to Turkey. The Turkish president has blamed Gulen and his followers for the failed military coup on Friday night, but Gulen has denied any involvement in or knowledge about the attempted coup. The U.S. says it will look at any evidence Turkey has to offer against Gulen, and judge accordingly.\nBozdag says "the United States would weaken itself by protecting him, it would harm its reputation. I don't think that at this hour, the United States would protect someone who carried out this act against Turkey."\nErdogan spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin after the failed coup attempt, Turkish officials told reporters.\nPutin said Moscow stood by "Turkey's elected government" and expressed his good wishes to Turkey's people, a Turkish government statement added.\nIt said the two leaders -- who recently patched up relations following Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane -- also agreed to meet face-to-face next month.\nThe reports Sunday followed an intensive crackdown against the judiciary and the military in the wake of the botched coup Friday night.\nAlready, three of the country's top generals have been detained, alongside hundreds of soldiers. The government has also dismissed nearly 3,000 judges and prosecutors from their posts, while investigators were preparing court cases to send the conspirators to trial on charges of attempting to overthrow the government.\nThe botched coup, which saw warplanes fly over key government installations and tanks roll up in major cities briefly, ended hours later when loyal government forces including military and police-- regained control of the military and civilians took to the streets in support of Erdogan.\nAt least 265 people were killed and more than 1,400 were wounded. Government officials say at least 104 conspirators were killed.\nStill, the coup appears to have boosted Erdogan's popularity. Clapping, singing and dancing, thousands of government backers celebrated the defeat of the coup in public squares in Ankara and Istanbul into the wee hours Sunday, bolstering support for the man who's led?Turkey?for over 13 years.\nErdogan's survival has turned him into a "sort of a mythical figure" and could further erode democracy in?Turkey, said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish research program at The Washington Institute.\n"It will allow him to crack down on liberty and freedom of association, assembly, expression and media in ways that we haven't seen before," he said.\nGozde Kurt, a 16-year-old student at a rally in Istanbul, said Sunday that "just a small group from Turkish armed forces stood up against our government ... but we, the Turkish nation, stand together and repulse it back."\nThe Yeni Safak newspaper used the headline "Traitors of the country," while the Hurriyet newspaper declared "Democracy's victory."\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

797565	http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/08/18/at-least-6-dead-more-than-120-wounded-in-bombings-targeting-turkish-police.html	At least 11 dead, more than 200 wounded in bombings targeting Turkish police	2016-08-18 00:00:00	At least 14 dead, more than 200 wounded in bombings targeting Turkish police\nPublished             August 18, 2016\nFacebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print\n?\nANKARA, Turkey ? ?A string of bombings, blamed on Kurdish rebels and targeting Turkey's security forces, killed at least 14 people and wounded more than 220 others, officials said Thursday.\nTwo of the attacks were car bombings that hit police stations in eastern Turkey, while a third ? a roadside blast ? targeted a military vehicle carrying soldiers in the southeast of the country.\nAuthorities say the assaults were carried out by the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has launched a campaign of car bombings targeting police stations or roadside bomb attacks against security force vehicles. Last week, PKK commander Cemil Bayik threatened increased attacks against police in Turkish cities.\nThe wave of attacks come as Turkey is focused on a clampdown on suspected followers of a movement led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, which the government accuses of orchestrating a failed military coup last month, that killed at least 270 people.\nThe first car bombing hit a police station in the eastern province of Van late Wednesday, killing a police officer and two civilians. At least 73 other people ? 53 civilians and 20 police officers ? were wounded, officials said.\nAnother car bombing hit police headquarters in the eastern Turkish city of Elazig early Thursday, killing at least five people, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. Officials said earlier 146 people were wounded and 14 of them were in serious condition.\nVideo footage showed a large plume of smoke rising from the area. Cars were overturned and the windows of the four-story building and its wings were blown out.\nIn the southeastern province of Bitlis meanwhile, five soldiers were killed after rebels detonated a roadside improvised explosive device as an armored military vehicle was passing by, officials said. Five other soldiers were wounded in the attack. A government-paid village guard, helping the security forces battle the PKK was also killed in a clash with rebels in the province, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.\nPrime Minister Binali Yildirim traveled to Elazig to visit the site of the bombing as well as those wounded in the attack.\nHe told reporters there that both the PKK and the Gulen movement were directed by the same "intelligence" intent on causing Turkey harm, without elaborating.\n"The (Gulen movement) has lost its assertiveness and has handed over the duty to the (PKK)," Yildirim said. "The intelligence that directs them is the same. When one's duty ends, the other takes up the duty."\nYildirim vowed to fight the PKK until it is "eliminated."\n"No terror organization will force this nation to cow in submission," Yildirim said.\nSpeaking in Ankara, Erdogan said Turkey was jointly attacked by various organizations who he said were in close contact with each other and were "acting under the same motivations even if they have different names."\nHe said the Turkish security forces have killed at least 182 Kurdish rebels in the weeks following the July 15 failed military coup, insisting that there has been no slackening in the fight against the PKK.\nFighting between the PKK and Turkey's security forces resumed last year after a fragile peace process collapsed. Since then, more than 600 Turkish security personnel and thousands of PKK militants have been killed, according to Anadolu. Human rights groups say hundreds of civilians have also died in the clashes.\nTens of thousands of people have died in the conflict since the PKK took up arms for autonomy in southeast Turkey in 1984. Turkey and its allies consider the PKK a terrorist organization.\nAmnesty International condemned Thursday's car bombings as "the latest in a series of reckless and brutal attacks."\n"Those responsible for these crimes show a contempt for the right to life and must be brought to justice," said Andrew Gardner, the rights group's Turkey researcher.\nOn Thursday, authorities imposed a temporary blackout on media coverage of the bombing in Elazig, citing "public order and national security" concerns.\nTurkey frequently imposes such bans following deadly bomb attacks. Thursday's order asked media organizations to refrain from broadcasting and publishing anything that may cause "fear in the public, panic and disorder and which may serve the aims of terrorist organizations."\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

The accusations have dominated headlines in newspapers in the wake of the plot, and have included such improbable claims as the involvement of California death row prisoner Scott Peterson.\nâ€œI am stating this very clearly: The United States of America planned to directly murder Turkeyâ€™s president and implemented this plan,â€? said Ibrahim Karagul, editor-in-chief of a largely circulated pro-Erdogan newspaper, Yeni Safak.\nRelated Image\nExpand / Contract\nBarkey, (l.), was at the island meeting, but Peterson, (r.), has an alibi: He was on death row.\nTurkey accuses Pennsylvania-based cleric Fethullah Gulen and his followers within Turkeyâ€™s government and military of fomenting the coup. Gulen and Erdogan, once friends and political allies, became sworn enemies after a 2013 corruption probe targeting Erdogan. Gulen, who operates a profitable chain of private schools in the U.S., vehemently denies involvement in the coup.\nWhile Turkey presses on for the extradition of Gulen, U.S. officials say Ankara has offered neither evidence nor a formal extradition request.\nAnother widely circulated, pro-Erdogan newspaper, Aksam, used its front cover earlier this month to reveal purported details about the coup. It accused Henri Barkey, a respected Lehigh University professor, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center and renowned expert on Turkey, of having gathered a group of 16 people on an island called Buyukada, near Istanbul, on the day of the coup â€œto hold a top secret meeting.â€?\nâ€œAccording to intelligence sources,â€? the article stated, â€œFethullah Gulen sympathizer Henri Barkey was going to get immediately involved, support the coup plotters, and run a biased broadcast on the coup.â€?\nBarkey told FoxNews.com the allegations were â€œridiculous,â€? but acknowledged holding the gathering ? to discuss the state of Iran. He said the meeting was planned more than six months in advance.\nRelated Image\nExpand / Contract\nErdogan is shown speaking after an emergency meeting of the government in Ankara last month. (Associated Press)\nâ€œIt is ridiculous, of course,â€? Barkey said. â€œThereâ€™s a conspiracy culture in Turkey that has taken over. I was taken aback, but you are dealing with journalists who are not journalists. They are hacks.\nâ€œThey just make things up,â€? he said. â€œAnd they describe incredibly detailed conspiracies. It is easy for them to do.â€?\nBirileri ger?ekten de FET? operasyonunu karartmak istiyor. TR'yi ve CB Erdo?an'? seven Ethem beye hi? yak??m?yor. pic.twitter.com/1iLO7ddfnZ\n? Mensur AkgÃ¼n (@mensurakgun) August 6, 2016\nThe claim that Peterson, who is on death row in San Quentin State Prison in California for the 2001 murder of his wife, was at the island gathering and has been assigned by the CIA to carry out assassinations in Turkey, underscores the bizarre nature of the media accusations.\nMensur Akgun, director of Global Political Trends Center in Turkey, who is believed to have attended the meeting, attempted to correct Aksam by announcing on Twitter that the Scott Peterson that was at the meeting was a journalist working for The Christian Science Monitor.\nâ€œYour claims are lies from beginning to the end,â€? he tweeted. â€œWhy is your correspondent not getting in touch with me?â€?\nThe anti-U.S. climate has sent a deep wave of unease washing over Americans who have lived and worked in Istanbul and Ankara for years.\nâ€œI have not been really worried since the beginning of the coup, but the rising talk of anti-Americanism is starting to get uncomfortable,â€? said a 34-year-old American freelance journalist who asked not to be identified and has been working in Istanbul for the past four years. â€œI have been used to the accusations of being a spy and all, but I fear that especially those who blindly support Erdogan are going to look at me as though I myself tried to kill their President. The thought of this actually gives me goosebumps.â€?\nMore than 200 people were killed in the July 15 coup attempt, in which members of the military briefly commandeered tanks, aircraft and communications channels. In the aftermath of its failure, Erdogan has led a brutal and widespread crackdown targeting those suspected of supporting Gulen. Some 23,000 people have been detained or arrested and 82,000 have been dismissed or suspended from their jobs.\nBarkey, who as an academic, insists he has allegiance to neither Erdogan nor Gulen, dismissed rumors that the coup was staged by Erdogan to flush out his enemies, and did not discount the possibility Gulen played a role.\nâ€œThere is circumstantial evidence that people close to Gulen were involved in the coup, but this was a coup that was not just related to him, but a coalition of different officers, each of whom had their own reasons to participate,â€? Barkey said. â€œIt doesnâ€™t mean that he did have a hand, it doesnâ€™t mean that he did not. We donâ€™t know.â€?\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Bangash) ?(The Associated Press)\nPrevious Next\nISLAMABAD ? ?One of Pakistan's most vicious militant groups has dramatically stepped up its attacks over the past month, striking mosques, Christians and security forces in attacks that have killed more than 60 people in what appears to be a backlash to military operations against it.\nEver since it broke away from the Pakistani Taliban in 2014, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar or the Freedom Movement had been carrying out sporadic attacks, often weeks or months apart. But since the beginning of September, it has struck 10 times, including a horrific bombing of a mosque earlier this month that killed 36 people, many of them children.\nThe spike in violence points to how Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, which the U.S. declared a terrorist organization last month, has eclipsed the Pakistani Taliban as the main, most aggressive militant group in a country where multiple armed extremist factions operate.\nThe Pakistani Taliban, or Tehrik-e-Taliban, have been struggling in the face of a two-year offensive by the military against its bases in North Waziristan, along the Afghan border. The assault has hampered its ability to carry out attacks and fueled splits by factions breaking away from the movement.\nIn contrast, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar has continued its blows even after military assaults on its home territory in Mohmand, another tribal area in the northwest of the country along the border with Afghanistan. It gained notoriety in late 2014 when it took responsibility for a vicious attack on a public army school that killed 125 people, most of them children, and again in early 2016 with a series of brutal attacks, including suicide bombings against Christians in Lahore on Easter that killed more than 70 people.\nIn a sign of its success, other groups have tried to claim responsibility for its attacks. For example, the Islamic State group ? which has been trying to make inroads into Pakistan ? made a competing claim to have carried out an August suicide bombing in the southwestern city of Quetta that killed nearly 80 people, mostly lawyers. But security officials say they believe Jamaat-ul-Ahrar was behind the attack.\nA counter-terrorism official in northwestern Pakistan said Jamaat-ul-Ahrar is the most extreme of the militant groups operating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and poses a "serious challenge" to security forces. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.\nPakistan's military in recent weeks picked up chatter among Jamaat-ul-Ahrar militants that warned of increased attacks, said Mahmood Shah, a retired army brigadier and former military intelligence official, who still has close military ties.\nThe chatter resulted in stepped up security which thwarted a Sept. 2 assault on a Christian colony in the northwestern city of Peshawar and an attempt last week to blow up a Shiite mosque in Punjab. Security officials stopped the attackers before they could reach their destinations.\nStill, the group's fighters succeeded in carrying out a string of 10 other attacks. Among them was a bombing of a courthouse in the northwestern city of Mardan that killed 12 people. Most of its attacks were against security forces or other officials in Mohmand or nearby Peshawar city, but it also carried out bombings and shootings across the country in the cities of Quetta and Karachi that killed several policemen.\nPakistan charges that Jamaat-ul-Ahrar trains and plots its attacks from safe havens in Afghanistan.\nPakistani forces moved into Mohmand in 2010, seeking to impose control over the region and push out militant groups. But over the past year, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar has crept back, establishing a presence in remote parts of the region despite the military's presence.\nIts fighters and leaders elude capture by moving back and forth across the border into Afghanistan's Nangarhar and Kunar provinces. The group's spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan, routinely calls journalists on an Afghan phone number.\nStill, in an interview with The Associated Press, Ehsan denied operating out of Afghanistan.\n"It is baseless that we are making plans on Afghan soil," he said in an email exchange this week.\nIslamabad's accusations have further muddied the uneasy relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan. For years, Kabul and Washington have accused Pakistan of providing refuge to Taliban leaders, especially the Haqqani group, which is routinely blamed for the worst attacks in Kabul. Pakistan denies the charge. Pakistan was one of only three countries to recognize the Taliban when they ruled Afghanistan before being ousted in 2001. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also recognized them.\nStill, Asad Munir, a retired Pakistan army brigadier and former intelligence chief in Peshawar, said Jamaat-ul-Ahrar has been weakened by military assaults on territory it controlled in Mohmand. Warrens of tunnels and hideouts that ran throughout the area have been uncovered and destroyed.\n"We don't need to be scared of them," he said.\nBut Jamaat-ul-Ahrar has built ties with other militant factions across Pakistan, including in the country's main region Punjab, hundreds of miles from Mohmand.\nIts leader, Omar Khaled Khorasani, a self-professed poet and former journalist, was once a member of the outlawed Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Punjab-based organization blamed by New Delhi for a weekend assault on an Indian military post in the disputed Kashmir region that killed 17 Indian soldiers.\nKhorasani also used to write regularly for Jaish-e-Mohammed's publication, Zarb-e-Momin, which attacks the west and India, promises to impose strict Islamic Shariah laws and extols the virtues of jihad and the rewards of martyrdom, according to Munir, the former intelligence officer.\nJamaat-ul-Ahrar also has ties to the virulently anti-Shiite Muslim group Lashkar-e-Janghvi and Lashkar-e-Taiba, an anti-Indian group, said Munir.\nAfter the U.S. last month declared the group a terrorist organization, Khorasani ? whose real name is Abdul Wali Khan ? made a long speech saying the group had no intention of waging attacks outside of Pakistan.\n"Jamaat-ul-Ahrar doesn't attack any country or its interests other than Pakistan," he said in the speech. "We have no involvement in any militant activity on global level."\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday about the disclosure a day earlier that the Islamic State may have attacked Qayara West air base with chemical weapons.\nU.S. officials had said Wednesday that an oily substance found on a fragment of the rocket that landed inside the security perimeter of the base initially tested positive for mustard agent, but that a second test was negative. They said further laboratory testing was scheduled.\n"We assess it to be a sulfur-mustard blister agent," Dunford said, adding that no one was injured by it.\nHe called the incident a "concerning development."\nDunford made no mention of the U.S. presence on the Qayara West base, but an official on Wednesday said "hundreds" of U.S. troops are there helping the Iraq security forces prepare for a coming offensive in Mosul.\nDunford said that while the Islamic State has a "chemical warfare network," it has only limited means of making effective chemical weapons. He noted that last week the U.S. military attacked a former pharmaceutical plant near Mosul in northern Iraq that U.S. officials said the Islamic State was using to produce mustard agent and other chemicals for military use.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Iraq to 4,647, from a previous authorization of 3,870 in January.\nIf President Obama signs off on the militaryâ€™s plan for more troops, the number would rise above 5,000. There are other U.S. troops inside Iraq that the Pentagon claims are on â€œtemporaryâ€? assignments, though some of these deployments last up to one year in country. Counting these troops, the new forces going to Iraq will push the unofficial number of American forces on the ground in Iraq to over 6,000 troops.\nThe new U.S. troops in Iraq will remain in an â€œadvisoryâ€? capacity, officials said. But U.S. troops have increasingly found themselves in danger in Iraq.\nIn addition to a rocket attack suspected of containing a â€œmustard agentâ€? earlier this week, nearly 500 U.S. troops at a base 25 miles south of Mosul have been attacked four times in the past week in conventional rocket attacks, Fox News is told.\nAn official with knowledge of one of the attacks said one rocket landed â€œreal closeâ€? to U.S. troops.\nâ€œThere is a real dangerâ€? U.S. troops face in Iraq right now, the official said.\nThree U.S. service members have been killed in Iraq fighting ISIS.\nOfficials said the planned deployment of 500 additional troops would not be going to Qayyarah Airfield, the base 25 miles south of Mosul, but elsewhere in the country as the U.S. military ramps up efforts to support Iraqi forces in a ground assault on Mosul expected to kick off in the next few weeks.\nA senior defense official confirmed to Fox News that Iraqi forces had successfully made it to the center of Shirqat, a key supply hub for ISIS forces 60 miles south of Mosul.\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the proposed new deployment.?\nLucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News Channel.

But they already seem to be well beyond the over-stretched and underfunded, U.N.-coordinated?humanitarian efforts that are still being put in place to contain and help them.\nThe coming?challenge exodus â€œis beyond my ability to articulate,â€? warns Suâ€™ad Jarbawi, Iraq country director for Mercy Corps, one of the worldâ€™s largest non-government relief organizations, which has worked in Iraq since 2003.\nâ€œThe order of magnitude we are going to see is tremendous,â€? she told Fox News?from her base of operations in the nearby Iraqi city of Erbil. â€œDo we know how it is going to unfold? No.â€?\nRelief planners like Jarbawi are still trying frantically, juggling funds and reworking plans to preposition supplies and camps for?as many as 1 million to 1.5 million?civilians who could be fleeing Mosul within weeks, or even days, when U.S.- and NATO-backed Iraqi government forces assault the city to retake it from the ISIS jihadists who have held it since 2014.?\nWhere exactly they will flee is also not known.\nâ€œIâ€™m looking at version 12 of a Mosul planning map,â€? one coordinator told Fox News. â€œItâ€™s not going to be the last.â€?\nâ€œWe plan with a very high degree of uncertainty.â€?\nEven as the relief contingents scramble, about?135,000 Iraqi residents of small towns and villages south of Mosul have fled?preliminary Iraqi government advances in the so-called â€œMosul corridorâ€? that were preliminaries to the main drive on the city. The larger assault could happen in a few weeks, or even days, depending on the Iraqi governmentâ€™s coherence and determination.\nThe early departures, which one humanitarian expert described as only a â€œtrickle,â€? are forcing additional grim forms of relief triage on aid organizations in northern Iraq that are struggling to deal with massive earlier displacements caused by ISIS and? recent government counter-offenses in neighboring Anbar province.\nâ€œWeâ€™ve had to stop actions in other areas,â€? one relief coordinator told Fox News. â€œThis is only a taste of what we are going to get.â€?\nAs newcomers arrive, they?also force humanitarian organizations to reduce, or even eliminate, relief supplies and cash handed over to earlier refugees, who are supposed to transit, in many cases, the relief from the Iraqi government.\nBut the government, in turn, is increasingly swallowed in a financial crisis brought on, atop the costs of war and human upheaval, by dramatically shrinking international oil prices.\nMoreover, as one aid worker put it, â€œIraqi [government] ministries are absolutely overwhelmed. They donâ€™t have systems to carry the load, along with the support, discipline and training.â€?\nThe outcome:? no money. â€œWe donâ€™t have enough to cover our needs today,â€? one humanitarian official told Fox News. That is especially true of life-preserving supplies like sanitary water tanks.\nA U.N.-coordinated â€œhumanitarian response planâ€? for Iraq this year that asked international donors to provide $861 million for relief efforts is only?about?60 percent funded.?The previous yearâ€™s $704 million humanitarian response plan was 74 percent funded, but support trailed off significantly in the second half of the year.\nFor Mosul, the news is worse: an additional $284 million â€œflash appealâ€? for the impending relief effort, announced in January, is only 48 percent covered.?Virtually every cent of the money so far comes from the U.S., which announced a week ago that it would contribute $181 million overall in new aid for Mosul.\nAlong with relief supply shortages there are other fast-growing needs, including doctors and health workers, teachers to keep displaced children in school, and other social services.\nâ€œNobody is taking up the slack,â€? one relief worker told Fox News.\nSome 3.3 million civilians overall are already displaced in Iraq as a result of years of war and the U.N. considers that 10 million overall are in need of assistance.?U.N. humanitarian appeals predict that the number in need could rise to 12 million to 13 million by the end of the year.\nThe full weight of the Mosul exodus, when it arrives, will offer real competition to Syria as a refugee catastrophe -- although Syria, which nearly 5?million residents fleeing abroad and 6.5 million internally displaced, is still in a league of its own.?\nThe mammoth size of the Syria cataclysm has, in turn, also helped to overshadow the full dimensions of the calamity in Iraq.\nRelief experts, however, say that Mosul?is likely to be the â€œsingle largest, most complexâ€? humanitarian operation in the world this year. Part of the complexity will be the strains it may cause between Iraqâ€™s still unstable central government and the Kurdish regional government in the north, where distrust of Baghdad is acute.\nKurdistan is already hosting more than 1 million Iraqi internal refugees, as well as some 239,000 Syrians.\nAnother part of that complexity is the effort required even when ISIS has been driven out of areas, as it already has been elsewhere in Iraq. What is left behind is often ruins, frequently mined and booby-trapped, that will require months of painstaking and dangerous effort to reclaim.\nThe refugees may well be unable to return home, as one official put it, â€œfor an indeterminate period.â€?\nThe looming Mosul crisis could quickly help to drown? the added? multinational efforts at refugee financing, retraining? and resettlement that Obama extolled as the outcome of?his summit earlier this week, and which were intended as?an antidote to donor fatigue and climbing unhappiness about immigrant absorption in the region and well beyond.?\nParticipants at the Obama summit?claimed that they will collectively add $4.5 billion beyond? 2015 levels to U.N. and other humanitarian appeals -- with about $1 billion more to come from the U.S. The new funds also are intended to lift some of the strain from neighboring countries, such as Jordan and Lebanon, that have been reeling under the impact of refugee flows from Syria.\nMore controversially, in terms of U.S. presidential elections, the summiteers said they would â€œroughly doubleâ€??the number of refugees they would resettle or otherwise admit to their own countries -- and specifically bump U.S. resettlement numbers for refugees from 70,000 in 2015 to 85,000?this year to 110,000 in 2017.?\nMosul got no specific mention in a joint statement by the U.S. and its summit co-hosts, which included Canada, Germany, Jordan and Mexico. Nor did it figure in Obamaâ€™s own remarks at the meeting, though the $181 million in recently announced Mosul aid doubtless was part of the announced $1 billion in additional U.S. assistance.\nCLICK HERE FOR OBAMAâ€™S REMARKS\nNor, moreover, did Mosul?figure in a sprawling and wafty â€œNew York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants,â€? passed by U.N. members at yet another summit convened a day earlier by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.\nThe 22-page document, with annexes, offered a variety of empty promises (â€œwe will ensure a people-centered, sensitive, humane, dignified, gender-sensitive and prompt reception for all persons arriving in our countriesâ€¦â€?) alongside a variety of windy profundities? (â€œstatelessness can be a root cause of forced displacement; in turn, forced displacement can lead to statelessnessâ€?).\nIt also promised that signatories would â€œcommitâ€? to implementing a 6-page Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework developed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), whose actions in Syria? and overall organizational abilities have been criticized harshly, even inside the U.N. itself.\nAccompanying the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework is supposed to come a Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which would â€œdeal with all aspects of international migration, including the humanitarian, developmental, human rights-related and other aspects of migration.â€?\nIt would,?a declaration assures the world, make â€œan important contribution to global governance and international cooperation on migrants and human mobility.â€?\nAll of that will be chewed over â€œthrough a process of intergovernmental negotiations, for which preparations will begin immediately.â€?\nThe negotiations -- presumably including governments whose barbarities are causing mass migrations in the first place -- will â€œculminateâ€? at yet another intergovernmental conference in 2018.\nAnd that, in turn, will be followed by a High-Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, to be held in New York â€œno later than 2019.â€?\nCLICK HERE FOR THE NEW YORK DECLARATION\nA

Despite the black-clad jihadist armyâ€™s tight grip within city limits, Iraqi and Kurdish military sources know ISIS has been digging in, fortifying positions, planting booby traps and preparing for a bloody siege.\nâ€œThe coalition has trained us very well in joint operations, medical training, our snipers, advanced bomb units and street guerrilla tactics," Col. Thamar Mohamed Ismael, commander of the Iraqi Army Emergency Response Division (ERD), told FoxNews.com this week from his unit's Baghdad base that once housed hundreds of U.S. troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom.\nRelated Image\nFirst Soldier Omar Salah al wad, (l.), and Capt. Omar Nazar, (r.), are ready totake Mosul back from ISIS. (FoxNews.com)\nHe and others who spoke to FoxNews.com said they expect the assault to begin next week.\nIraqi and coalition forces have in recent days bombarded Mosul with radio broadcasts and leaflets instructing civilians of the coming offensive and notifying them of their exit routes, ginning up speculation that action is imminent.\nAerial attacks are expected to soften up known ISIS targets first, and then Iraqi special operations battalions will spearhead the ground assault, Ismael said. Iraqi troops will then move in, with the grim possibility of fighting block-to-block and door-to-door in a city that was once home to 2.5 million and has been controlled by ISIS since June, 2014. The Kurdish military ? known as Peshmerga - will keep the frontlines to the north secure, with Sunni militias guarding the outside of the city. It is unclear what role Shia militias will play.\nRelated Image\nExpand / Contract\nIraqi Army Col. Thamer Mohumed Ismael, (l.), and intel chief Haitham al Malaki, (r.), expect the assault to begin next week. (FoxNews.com)\nIraqi military officials have intel from inside Mosul, much of which has been gleaned from spies within ISIS, said Haitham al-Malaki, head of military intelligence for the ERD. Working closely with the U.S.-led coalition, Malaki has obtained troves of key documents and sources that have paved the path for the Mosul offensive to kick into high gear.\n"We've identified most of their communications and financial supplies," he told FoxNews.com.\nA major part of the plan includes safeguarding the thousands of Yazidi women believed to be held hostage as sex slaves in the city.\n"The minute we are on the verge of the city, we will notify those assets to go in and collect as many girls as possible before going in," Malaki told FoxNews.com. "We will also open a rescue path to ensure safe passage for the ones we can't get beforehand."\nPerhaps the biggest question looming ahead of the operation is the whereabouts of shadowy ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Reports have claimed he was injured ? and even killed ? in the past, but intelligence sources believe he is likely alive and well and hiding somewhere around Mosul.\nSeveral military officials said the offensive to take control of Mosul could happen as fast as four days to a week. However, Malaki anticipates that it will likely take two months to take back full control, clearing the city of threats and rooting out holdout fighters.\n"It will take longer than the others due to the vast majority of people there and the size of the land," he said.\nConditions inside Mosul are believed to have deteriorated significantly in recent months, with inside sources telling FoxNews.com families have been starving due to high costs and limited supplies. Medicine has become scarce, and cash-strapped ISIS is believed to have stopped supplying civilians with the services they once offered in exchange for support.\nERD Captain Omar Nazar, 28, said civilians have turned on ISIS and will be a key to the operationâ€™s success.\n"We expect many civilians to stay there," Nazar said. "ISIS isn't the same ISIS as before, we have conquered them emotionally. Their morale is gone."\nUnited Nations officials and non-governmental organization leaders have converged in the Northern Iraq town of Erbil this week in preparation for refugees the offensive could produce. However, the deteriorating security situation and high level of suicide bombings in the area surrounding Mosul have made it difficult to set up aid bases and camps, sources told FoxNews.com.\nThe fight for Mosul is both symbolic and strategic. The Iraqi army was humiliated when the city was overrun more than two years ago. Soldiers fled their posts, leaving behind weapons, munitions and even uniforms in a display that demonstrated the militaryâ€™s shocking inability to protect the nation from the growing threat of ISIS. Over the next two years, the terrorist army overran much of northwestern Iraq, claiming a caliphate the size of the United Kingdom.\nIraqi soldiers are now eager to reclaim the city ? and their armyâ€™s reputation.\n"This will be honor, it is my desire to protect my country," said First Soldier Omar Salah al Wad, a 29-year-old father of four from Ramadi. Wounded seven times in battles with ISIS, he added, "I want my country to be as good as it can for my kids."\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

No one else was killed or hurt.\nGovernor Erkan Topaca said police, acting on a tip, launched an operation to catch a man and a woman who were suspected of planning a suicide car bombing in Ankara. They were hiding inside a hut at a horse farm in the district of Haymana, just outside of the capital.\n"Police called on them to surrender. They did not respond in a positive way. They blew themselves up before we could intervene," Topaca told reporters at the scene.\nTopaca said it was "highly likely" that the one of them was linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has carried out a series of suicide car bombings over the past year.\n"The organization they are connected to is not clear yet but according to information we have received, it is highly likely that (the man) is linked to the PKK. The way the incident was carried out and planned points at the PKK," he said.\nTopaca said the pair would have carried out a suicide car bomb attack although their target was not known. The assailants had hung a Turkish flag on their car, in an apparent attempt to disguise themselves, he said.\nTurkey has been rocked by a wave of bomb attacks since last summer that have killed hundreds of people and been blamed on either the PKK or the Islamic State group.\nFighting between the PKK and the state security forces resumed last year after the collapse of a fragile 2 1/2-year cease-fire. Since then, more than 600 Turkish security personnel and thousands of PKK militants have been killed in clashes, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. Rights groups say hundreds of civilians have also been killed in the clashes.\nThe deadliest attack took place in Ankara on Oct. 10, 2015, killing 103 people attending a peace rally -- including many Kurdish activists. Authorities blamed that attack on the Islamic State group.\nOn Thursday, 10 people were slightly wounded by a bomb mounted on a motorcycle which exploded near a police station in Istanbul. On Friday the militant Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, or TAK, considered an offshoot of the PKK, claimed responsibility. Six people have been detained in connection with that attack.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Rivers and creeks overflowed, driving people from their homes.\nThe unofficial rainfall totals were staggering: 18 inches in Wilmington, 14 inches in Fayetteville and 8 inches in Raleigh. "This is a very, very serious and deadly storm," Gov. Pat McCrory said.\nOfficials in Haiti said the storm killed more than 500 people when it tore across the country as a hurricane.\nShortly before daybreak, the hurricane was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone. As of 8 a.m. EDT, the storm was centered about 60 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, moving out to sea. It still had hurricane-force winds of 75 mph.\nForecasters said North Carolina and Virginia could get even more rain and warned of the danger of life-threatening flooding through Monday night.\nWhile the crisis was far from over in North Carolina, other places to the south began getting back to normal, with millions relieved that the storm wasn't the catastrophe that many had been bracing for.\nIn many places along the Southeast coast, the damage consisted mostly of flooded streets, blown-down signs and awnings, flattened trees and power outages. The storm made landfall as a hurricane Saturday in?McClellanville, South Carolina -- the same town where Hurricane Hugo made landfall in 1989, Fox Carolina reported .\nAs the skies cleared on Saturday, people started cleaning up, reopening their businesses or hitting the beach. The power started coming back on. And all three major theme parks in Orlando, Florida, including Walt Disney World, were up and running.\nAlong Daytona Beach's main drag, the Silver Diner had all of its shiny metal siding ripped off the front and sides, leaving only a wood frame exposed. Next door, the window of a souvenir shop had been blown out and the roof and ceiling torn through, leaving pink insulation dangling.\nDavid Beasley, president of Insurance Recovery Inc., surveyed the damage and said that although it looked bad, the main strip was hit harder by Hurricanes Charley and Frances in 2004.\n"This is not much compared to those two," he said.\nOn Saturday, Matthew sideswiped two of the South's oldest and most historic cities -- Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina -- and also brought torrential rain and stiff wind to places like Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\nAfter pounding North Carolina and drenching parts of Virginia, it was expected to veer out to sea, lose steam and loop back around toward the Bahamas and Florida, too feeble to cause any trouble.\nFor nearly its entire run up the coast from Florida, Matthew hung just far enough offshore that communities did not feel the full force of its winds.\nIts storm center, or eye, finally blew ashore just north of Charleston on Saturday, but only briefly. And by that time, Matthew was just barely a hurricane, with winds of just 75 mph.\nMatthew's winds were howling at a terrifying 145 mph when the hurricane struck Haiti, where five days later the full extent of the tragedy was not yet known because some devastated areas were still unreachable.\nAbout 100 guests and workers had to be evacuated from a Comfort Inn motel in the North Carolina coastal town of Southport after the hurricane cracked a wall and left the roof in danger of collapse, authorities said. And dramatic video showed Fayetteville police rescuing a woman and her small child from their car as rising waters swallowed it.\nAn estimated 2 million people in the Southeast were ordered to evacuate their homes as Matthew closed in. By hugging the coast, the storm behaved pretty much as forecasters predicted. A shift of just 20 or 30 miles could have meant widespread devastation.\n"People got incredibly lucky," Colorado State University meteorology professor Phil Klotzbach. "It was a super close call."\nWhile Matthew's wind speed had dropped considerably by the time it hit the Southeast coast, the storm will rank as one of the most powerful hurricanes on record, based on such factors as wind energy and longevity, and as one of the most long-lived major hurricanes, too.\nIt was a major hurricane -- that is, with winds of at least 110 mph -- for just over seven days.\nHundreds of thousands of people lost power in North Carolina, three-quarters of a million in South Carolina, 250,000 in Georgia and about 1 million in Florida.\nEight deaths were blamed on the storm in North Carolina, four deaths in Florida, three in Georgia and three in South Carolina. The deaths included an elderly Florida couple who died from carbon monoxide fumes while running a generator in their garage and two women who were killed when trees fell on a home and a camper.\nProperty data firm CoreLogic projected that insured losses on home and commercial properties would amount to $4 billion to $6 billion, well below Hurricane Katrina's $40 billion and Superstorm Sandy's $20 billion.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Pat McCrory told reporters.\nThe governor urged people in the danger zone to stay out of flooded areas, adding that "this is a life and death decision" for residents and rescuers. "If you've been told to evacuate, evacuate."\nEvacuations were ordered in cities along three different rivers. Some rivers were expected to be at record levels Friday -- six days after the end of Matthew's rains.\nNearly 1 million homes and businesses in North and South Carolina were waiting Monday for the power to come back on. The disaster was forecast to unfold slowly?over the next several days as all that rain -- more than a foot in places -- flows into rivers and downstream, in some of the same places devastated by a similar deluge from Hurricane Floyd in 1999.\nThe National Weather Service downgraded Matthew to a post-tropical cyclone on Sunday. While people hit hard by the storm face a long rebuilding period, the threat of any additional severe weather from Matthew appears to be over,? Fox Carolina reports .\nThe storm killed at least 21 people in the U.S., including 10 in North Carolina. McCrory said the latest reported death was a driver swept away by flood waters in Johnston County. He also said three people were reported missing: one in Johnston County and two in Cumberland County.\nOfficials in Virginia on Monday reported one storm-related death, saying a driver died when a truck rear-ended a tractor trailer stopped for a downed tree on Interstate 64 in Chesapeake on Saturday.\nThousands of people found themselves suddenly trapped in homes and cars during the torrential rains over the weekend. Rescuers in Coast Guard helicopters plucked some of them from rooftops and used military vehicles to reach others. The storm killed more than 500 people in Haiti.\nUtility outage maps showed Monday that just under a half million electric customers across South Carolina were still in the dark.\nNorth Carolina Emergency Management reported that about 491,000 residents were without service Monday morning. The state's largest utility, Duke Energy, had the biggest problems, with about 310,000 customers without service.\nPower companies say it may be several days before power can be restored to all electric customers.\nMcCrory said that the Federal Aviation Administration has placed temporary flight restrictions over Lumberton. He asked operators of drones to keep them out of the airspace over flooded areas so they do not endanger helicopter teams. He also said that "inland flooding" remains the greatest threat to the state.\nPresident Obama spoke by phone on Monday with FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and with Obama's homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco. The White House said Obama emphasized that all needed federal resources should be directed to affected states.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Aid convoys are arriving from the capital, now that some roads washed out by Hurricane Matthew have been cleared. A barge carrying food and water is moored offshore.\nAn international response is finally getting underway as Haitian authorities try to gauge the full extent of the staggering blow delivered by Hurricane Matthew, including hundreds dead and tens of thousands of homes obliterated.\nThe precise death toll remained uncertain Sunday. Guillaume Silvera, a senior official with the Civil Protection Agency in the storm-blasted Grand-Anse Department, which includes Jeremie, said at least 522 deaths were confirmed there alone -- not including people in several remote communities still cut off by collapsed roads and bridges.\nNational Civil Protection headquarters in Port-au-Prince, meanwhile, said Saturday its official count for the whole country was 336, which included 191 deaths in Grand-Anse.\nHaiti began three days of formal national mourning on Sunday under a decree issued by President Jocelerme Privert, even as aid began to move toward flattened communities.\n"It's beginning to pick up now," said Stephane Rolland, a regional coordinator for the International Federation of the Red Cross, as workers unloaded blankets, soap, bleach and other critical items in Jeremie on Saturday.\nThere are clearly limits, though, including the fact that the airstrip in Jeremie is unable to accommodate large cargo planes, and only operates in the daytime. Many of the villages in the southwestern peninsula are difficult to reach. And people are growing increasingly desperate after losing everything when the storm ripped through the area on Tuesday.\nOne woman stared with outstretched arms as a U.N. convoy drove through town. "I am hungry. I hope they can help," said Fabienne Charles, explaining that she would normally be working as a market vendor but lost her supplies in the storm.\nGovernment officials estimate that at least 350,000 people need assistance, and concern was growing over an increase in cholera cases following widespread flooding unleashed by Matthew. An ongoing cholera outbreak has already killed roughly 10,000 people and sickened more than 800,000 since 2010, when the infectious disease was introduced into the country's biggest river from a U.N. base where Nepalese peacekeepers were deployed.\nMaria Sofia Sanon, a health worker overseeing the open-air cholera treatment center in a corner of Jeremie's main hospital, said they were ill-equipped to deal with patients. The area was strewn with broken tree branches, and a group of young mothers sat outside holding up the arms of their glassy-eyed children being rehydrated via IVs.\n"They're not supposed to be in the sun, but we have no more beds," Sanon said.\nThe World Food Program says there has been massive destruction of crops. Hospitals and clinics have been damaged or destroyed as they struggle to deal with an increase in patients with injuries sustained during the storm as well as an apparent increase in cholera. UNICEF said that in Grand Anse alone there were 66,000 houses destroyed and 20,000 heavily damaged.\n"Information gathered from various sources in the field suggests that the human toll (dead and injured) will be heavier than the current official figures," the agency said in a report.\nJocelyne Saint Preux was part of the crowd that lined up in an orderly fashion to get food as aid began to arrive, including shipments of food and other emergency supplies from the U.S. Agency for International Development carried by waves of military transport helicopters.\nThe mother of three children whose home was destroyed said officials were handing out wheat, beans, oil and salt.\n"Yes, they brought food, but it's not sufficient," she said. "There's no water. There's no charcoal."\nAs aid trickled into Jeremie, Jislene Jean-Baptiste surveyed what remained of the one-room house that the grandmother shares with her three daughters and their children. There wasn't much left. Storm surge flowed across the road and drenched her belongings in waist-deep salt water, washing away the stores of rice and sugar she regularly sold at the market to support her family. Then the wind tore off her roof.\n"That storm was the most terrifying thing that ever happened here," she said.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.
988177	http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/19/top-9-moments-third-presidential-debate.html	The top 9 moments of the third presidential debate	2016-10-20 00:00:00	The top 9 moments of the third presidential debate\nPublished               October 19, 2016\nFacebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print\n?\nDonald Trump on Wednesday night didnâ€™t threaten to prosecute his opponent should he win the presidency on Nov. 8. Hillary Clinton didnâ€™t spout off any obviously canned phrases for â€œSaturday Night Liveâ€? to mock. But there were still plenty of fireworks during the third -- and final -- presidential debate of 2016.\nHere are the nightâ€™s top nine moments:\n1. â€œBad hombresâ€?\nTrump, the Republican presidential nominee, raised eyebrows during his response to a question about border security. The content of his answer wasnâ€™t surprising for anyone whoâ€™s listened to Trump since he began his run for the White House -- build a wall and deport the â€œbad, bad people in this country.â€? But near the end of the remarks, Trump suddenly used a slang Spanish word for â€œmen.â€?\nâ€œWe have some bad hombres here and weâ€™re gonna get them out,â€? Trump said.\nSocial media immediately lit up with reactions, and â€œBad Hombresâ€? was one of the top Twitter trends within minutes. The phrase had been tweeted out nearly 130,000 times by the time the debate ended.\nSee the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map â†’\nEven Clintonâ€™s digital team quickly jumped on the phrase, tweeting out â€œHombresâ€?? #debatenight\n?\n2. â€œOpen Bordersâ€?\nModerator Chris Wallace pressed Clinton on a controversial remark she made during a paid speech to a Brazilian bank shortly after she ended her tenure as secretary of state. Clinton has resisted releasing the transcripts of her so-called â€œWall Street speechesâ€? despite pressure from her primary and general election opponents. Some of the transcripts, however, recently leaked out when WikiLeaks published a trove of stolen emails allegedly belonging to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.\nâ€œWe've learned from WikiLeaks that you said this, and I want to quote, â€˜my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders,â€™â€? Wallace asked.\nTrump immediately leaned into his microphone and said â€œThank you.â€?\nClinton said the line had been misconstrued. She said she was talking about â€œenergyâ€? coming across borders, not illegal immigration.\nTrump rolled his eyes and smirked at the explanation.\n?\n3. Vladimir Putin\nAfter the topics of WikiLeaks and the Podesta hack were broached, the discussion turned toward Russia, the nation many intelligence experts believe was behind the Podesta hacking. Clinton attacked Trump for being too cozy with Russian president Vladimir Putin and said Trump would be Putinâ€™s â€œpuppet as president.â€?\nTrump responded: â€œNo puppet, no puppet. Youâ€™re the puppet.â€?\nAfter some crosstalk, Trump continued to counterpunch.\nâ€œShe doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her every step of the way,â€? he said.\n?\n4. Abortion and The Supreme Court\nThe next president might appoint as many as three Supreme Court justices, Wallace noted, a number that could influence whether the court leans left or right for an entire generation. The hot-button topic of abortion was discussed in this context, with Clinton unable to answer if she could ever support any regulation on the controversial procedure.\nTrump responded with one of the most passionate -- and graphic -- answers heâ€™d given during any debate.\nâ€œIf you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby,â€? Trump said. â€œNow, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay with me.â€?\n?\n5. Sexual misconduct allegations\nSince lewd comments Trump made on a hot mic in 2005 were revealed two weeks ago, several women have come forward with claims that Trump sexually assaulted them. Trump denied all of the charges and accused Clinton â€œand her very sleazy campaignâ€? of being behind the stories.\nâ€œWell, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked,â€? Trump said. â€œThose people, I don't know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it.â€?\nClinton responded: â€œDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.â€?\n?\n6. Violence at rallies\nClinton lambasted Trump for being responsible for the rhetoric that she said provoked several violent incidents during his primary and general election rallies.\nâ€œThis is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies,â€? Clinton said.\nTrump, however, said it was Clinton who was guilty of starting the unrest. He cited an edited, undercover video released this week by a conservative activist. The footage allegedly shows Democrat operatives discussing how they have incited violence at Trump rallies.\nâ€œSo sad when she talks about violence at my rallies and she caused the violence,â€? Trump said. â€œIt's on tape.â€?\n?\n7. Clinton Foundation vs. Trump Foundation\nClinton and Trump traded shots about their respective namesake charity foundations, both of which have come under fire for various scandals.\nWhen Clinton initially said she was â€œthrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation,â€? Trump saw an opening.\nâ€œIt's a criminal enterprise,â€? he said. â€œSaudi Arabia giving 25 million dollars. Qatar, all of these companies. You talk about women and women's rights. So these are people that push gays off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money. So I'd like to ask you right now why don't you give back the money that you have taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don't you give back the money?â€?\nClinton retorted: â€œAnd I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six-foot portrait of Donald,â€? Clinton said. â€œI mean, who does that?â€?\n?\n8. Trump may not accept election results\nThough he said during the first presidential debate that he would accept the results of Novemberâ€™s election whether he won or lost, Trump on Wednesday said he wasnâ€™t so sure anymore. Trump has been frequently talking during rallies about his belief that the election is â€œrigged.â€?\nâ€œI will look at it at the time,â€? he said Wednesday night. â€œI'm not looking at anything now I will look at it at the time. What I've seen is so bad.â€?\nTrump also said Clinton shouldnâ€™t be eligible to run for the presidency because of her secret server scandal. Though authorities said Clinton was careless, after a lengthy investigation the FBI declined to charge her.\nâ€œShe's guilty of a very, very serious crime,â€? Trump said. â€œShe should not be allowed to run...What I'm saying now is I will tell you. I will keep you in suspense, okay?â€?\n?\n9. Rigged\nFollowing up on Trumpâ€™s talk of a â€œriggedâ€? election, Clinton said the rhetoric was not only untrue, but also a tool commonly employed by the billionaire businessman.\nâ€œEvery time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is is rigged against him,â€? she said. â€œThe FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails. They concluded there was no case. He said that the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus; he lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering. He claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged.â€?\nAfter hearing Clintonâ€™s comment about the Emmyâ€™s, Trump interrupted: â€œI should have gotten it.â€?\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

IBD ,? ABC/WaPo ,? Fox News ,? Pew ?and? CNBC .]\nTRUMP PUMPS BIG BUCKS INTO CAMPAIGN\nFacing criticism over a paltry contribution to his own campaign in the closing month,?Donald Trump?has reportedly dumped $10 million into his campaign today.\nThe WSJ? reports ?that in the wake of the revelation that Trumpâ€™s contribution to his financially outgunned campaign had only been about $30,000 in October, the real estate and reality television mogul has ponied up a big chunk of change.\nâ€œThe move comes at a critical juncture for Mr. Trump, as he entered the final weeks of the election with about one-fourth as much cash in his campaign coffers as Democratic rival?Hillary Clinton,â€? the journal writes, â€œMrs. Clinton had more than $62 million in the bank as of Oct. 19, compared with Mr. Trumpâ€™s $16 million,?according to new FEC disclosures.â€?\nTrumpâ€™s total campaign contributions are now estimated at about $66 million dollars, short of the $100 million pledge heâ€™s made, but nothing to sneeze at.\nThe campaign is plowing the money into swing state television advertising, a strategy about which Trump and others in his orbit were formerly skeptical. Once, the Trump campaign seemed more focused on holding rallies for loyal supporters and dominating the media discussion.\nTrumpâ€™s fundraising slowed in October as big donors? shied away , and there were signs that Trump, his family and closest advisers werenâ€™t? betting on a win with their own contributions either.\nThe question about campaign cash is really about whether it is enough for the task at hand. There is such a thing as too much. Exhibit A: Clintonâ€™s campaign is drowning in money. She has? already raised ?about $1 billion, and has so much cash on hand that she could spend $8 million a day without raising another dime.\nAs of last week, Trump had just $16 million on hand, a paltry sum compared to Clintonâ€™s war chest.\nBut in these days of â€œdark moneyâ€? itâ€™s helpful to also look at what outside groups are raising and spending. Altogether, Trump and outside groups had $67 million compared to $154 million for Clinton & Co.\nThatâ€™s just arbitrary scorekeeping, though. The bleached bones of?Jeb Bushâ€™s campaign stand as stark testament that cash advantages do not equal electoral advantages.\nBut money matters. Trumpâ€™s organizational deficiencies reflected in saggy early voting numbers and limited ground game operations in key states, canâ€™t be rectified by his late cash commitment. Big money means big advantages early on, but less so later.\nThe best thing this money may do is reassure Trumpâ€™s core supporters that he is still in it to win it, despite his long-shot status.\nPOWER PLAY: WHY DIDNâ€™T HILLARY PUT OUT THE FIRE EARLY?\nA WikiLeaks dump exposes one top Clinton ally asking the same question as everyone else: why didnâ€™t Clintonâ€™s camp deal with the private email server before the media exposed it?

(Wallace, incidentally, had gotten a vote from a faithless elector four years earlier.)

Lesin, 57, was Putin's former press minister and helped found the English-language news service Russia Today.\nBased on video and other evidence and interviews with witnesses, officials said Lesin entered his room at the Doyle Dupont Circle Hotel on the morning of Nov. 4, 2015, after a dayslong drinking binge and was injured while alone in his room. His body was found the next day. Russian news media, citing relatives, initially reported that Lesin had a heart attack.\nBlunt force injuries to his head and body were released as the cause of death in March, but authorities didn't say how he got the injuries.\nLaShon Beamon, director of communications for the D.C. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, confirmed Friday that the death has been ruled accidental with the chief cause listed as blunt force trauma to the head. Contributing causes were listed as blunt force trauma to the neck, torso and upper and lower extremities, along with acute ethanol intoxication. She said District law prevents release of the autopsy report or any other information, though she said the autopsy report can be provided to Lesin's family.\nAnnual reports submitted by the medical examiner's office show that intoxication plays a role in a large number of the accidental deaths investigated by the office.\nA day after the autopsy details were released in March, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Russian Embassy made multiple requests for information about the investigation, but received no substantive material. State Department spokesman John Kirby said at the time that State Department officials facilitated communication between Washington, D.C., police and the Russian government. Kirby said he did not know why Lesin was in the country when he died.\nOn Friday, Russian Embassy spokesman Yuri Melnik declined comment.\nLesin built a career in television advertising in the early 1990s, making his company the industry's leader. In 1999, he was named Russian media minister and played a key role in getting Putin elected in 2000.

1094298	http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/11/06/kids-with-sleep-apnea-more-likely-to-have-depression.html	Kids with sleep apnea more likely to have depression	2016-11-17 00:00:00	Parents may not know how much sleep their children need\nâ€œWhile I do not have experience with depression, Iâ€™m willing to bet it will be easier to control,â€? Gold recalled telling John's father at the time.\nGold diagnosed John with sleep apnea and implanted a palate expander. After he healed, his sleep improved, he had more energy and he even lost about 40 pounds.\nâ€œAfter the palate expander, I found that I could have 6 to 8 hours of sleep and feel very well rested,â€? he said.\nHis depression lifted too and he no longer needed more ECT treatments.\nâ€œFor me, it really changed the path I was on,â€? he said.\nThe sleep apnea-depression link\nThe National Sleep Foundation estimates between 2 to 3 percent of children have sleep apnea and between 10 and 20 percent of those who snore do as well. ?\nChildren who are overweight, have autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome or other neurodevelopment disorders are more likely to have sleep apnea than the general pediatric population, said Dr. Carole Marcus, director of the Sleep Center at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia and a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nThe National Institutes of Health estimate that 11 percent of children between ages 13 and 18 have major depressive disorder. In 2015, approximately 3 million kids between ages 12 and 17 had at least one major depressive episode in the past year.\nDepression can increase a childâ€™s risk for substance abuse and suicide, which is the third leading cause of death for children between the age of 10 and 24, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nWhatâ€™s more, children up to age 18 with sleep apnea are more likely to also have depression, according to a meta-analysis in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.\nâ€œWe know that children with sleep apnea have a number of behavior and quality-of-life issues,â€? said Dr. Adelle Cadieux, a child psychologist at Helen DeVos Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan. â€œBoth of these conditions are underecognized in children. Both parents and pediatricians tend to miss the diagnosis.â€?\nAlthough the association between sleep apnea and depression is not clear, experts say there are a few possible reasons.\nSince sleep apnea affects a childâ€™s quality of sleep, it can disrupt behavior, concentration, memory and mood. The low oxygen levels affect hormones and the brain, which can then lead to depression.\nâ€œAnybody who has had a poor nightâ€™s sleeping feels bad the next day. For children with sleep apnea, thatâ€™s happening every night,â€? Cadieux said.\nAlso, many kids with sleep apnea are obese, which in itself is closely linked to depression.\nYet children with snoring and sleep-disordered breathing have more symptoms of depression whether they are obese or not, according to a study in the journal SLEEP.\nâ€œChronic depression is a consequence of chronic stress and sleep apnea is the single largest and unrecognized contributor to chronic stress,â€? Gold said.\nSleep apnea has also been linked to low serotonin levels, which is associated with depression.\nWhatâ€™s more, sleep apnea can lead to resistance to leptin, a hormone that suppresses appetite. The result is weight gain and obesity, according to the meta-analysis in SLEEP. For an obese teen, low self-esteem and depression can exacerbate the symptoms. ?\nKnow the signs\nExperts agree that the signs of both sleep apnea and depression make them hard to diagnose.\nâ€œThe way depression looks in a young child can be very very different from an adolescent and even that can look different from what you see in an adult,â€? Marcus said.\nDistinct changes in behavior like irritability, crying over minor incidents, sleeping more or less than usual and appetite changes are all red flags. While some children will become withdrawn, others will act out.\nIn preschool children, â€œyou may not hear them say, â€˜Iâ€™m sad,â€™â€? Marcus said. ?\nSnoring, choking, gasping for air, labored breathing and increased sleepiness are all signs of sleep apnea.\nExperts noted that symptoms of insomnia, ADHD and fatigue may be due to sleep apnea and not depression alone. .\nâ€œThey should always first rule out sleep apnea because itâ€™s treatable without medication, Gold said. ?\nHow to get help\nIf you suspect your child has sleep apnea, depression or both, talk to your childâ€™s pediatrician first to determine the best course of action.\nNot all kids will need to have a sleep study and your doctor may be able to tease out other factors that affect your childâ€™s sleep.\nIf your child has both conditions, he will need to be treated. Even if sleep apnea is managed, your child will likely need help with the depression, too, Marcus said.\nOther treatments include a nasal steroid, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and a weight-loss plan.\nHaving tonsils and adenoids removed can help children with sleep apnea if theyâ€™re removed when a child is young.\nJohn is now healthy and working towards a masterâ€™s degree in social work. He also sees a therapist for maintenance treatment.\nâ€œIt really is a pretty incredible change from when I look back at where I was,â€? he said.\n*name has been changed\nJulie Revelant is a health journalist and a consultant who provides content marketing and copywriting services for the healthcare industry.

The Bataclan said all 1,000 Sting tickets sold out quickly and other tickets were given to the families of the 90 revelers slain a year ago by extremists with automatic weapons and explosive belts.\nRelated Image\nExpand / Contract\nSting performs on stage at the Bataclan concert hall Saturday. (Boris Allin/Universal Music France via AP)\nSting, in a T-shirt with a guitar slung over his shoulder, asked concert-goers in fluent French to observe a minute of silence as he opened the show.\n"We've got two important things to do tonight," the singer said. ?"First, to remember and honor those who lost their lives in the attacks a year ago ... and to celebrate the life and the music of this historic venue. ... We shall not forget them."\nHe then strummed out a string of hits, including "Fragile" and "Message in a Bottle."\nSUSPECTED COORDINATOR OF PARIS, BRUSSELS TERROR ATTACKS IDENTIFIED\nElodie Suigo, who lost six friends in the attack, said that it was a hard night, even though she loved the music.\n"It was difficult going through that door. I don't think I was the only one... We cannot say it was a magical moment because of everything that changed in our lives. But (Sting) is a really great man," she said.\nThe coordinated attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 last year targeted bars, restaurants and the sports stadium, leaving 130 people dead and hundreds more injured . The worst extremist violence ever to hit France, they were claimed by the Islamic State group.\nSome survivors on Saturday stayed outside the Bataclan in quiet vigil, while others inside stood silently sipping a drink, waiting for the concert to start. The smell of fresh paint from the reconstruction hung over the crowd.\nAurelien Perrin, 25, survived the Bataclan massacre but his friend Nicolas Berthier did not.\n"I came alone tonight. It's very emotional, as I keep getting flashbacks of that night. I was standing just there, just the other side of the bar when it happened. Tonight is the first time I've been back here since," he said.\nPerrin added that he had not been to any bar or even the cinema since that fateful night.\n"I'm here because it's important to finally finish a concert that was never allowed to end. It's for the memory of my friend and for all the 90 people who died," he said.\nAnother survivor, Mariesha Jack Payne, waited across the road from the Bataclan in The Barometer bar, where she was rushed to after the attack. She traveled from Scotland for the commemorations in Paris this weekend.\n"Even if I'm not inside, it's symbolic for me to be here nearby. The important day is tomorrow. I come back to this bar every time I'm in Paris now," she said.\nSting, 65, is no stranger to the Bataclan, playing there decades ago in 1979 as the lead singer of The Police. The singer's new album "57th & 9th" was released Friday.\nSting says proceeds from the concert would go to two charities helping survivors. More than 1,700 people have been officially recognized as victims of the horror that unfolded at the Bataclan, Paris cafes and France's national stadium.\nJuliette Meadel, the French minister for victims' aid and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo were among those at the concert.\nEven some of the VIPs were caught up in the wild energy that swept through the crowd.\nFrance's Culture Minister Audrey Azoulay wasn't in the official seating area, but was seen standing next to the bar, jumping up and down as Sting performed ?his hit song "Roxanne," inspired by the prostitutes he encountered outside a hotel where the band stayed in Paris' red-light district in 1977.\nSome who were invited decided against attending the emotionally charged event.\n"I don't want to put a foot in the Bataclan. Even if Sting is a legend. I'm staying with my family tonight," said Jean Marie de Peretti, father of Aurelie de Peretti who died in the concert hall massacre.\nThe concert hall -- which has been refurbished to its original state -- will remain closed on Sunday's actual anniversary of the attacks, when President Francois Hollande and Hidalgo, the Paris mayor, will unveil plaques in memory of victims at the half-dozen sites where revelers died.\nIn addition to those killed, nine people remain hospitalized from the attacks and others are paralyzed or otherwise irreparably injured. The government says more than 600 people are still receiving psychological treatment related to the attacks.\nFrench Prime Minister Manuel Valls, in a commentary given to a half-dozen European newspapers, warned that "Yes, terrorism will strike us again." But, he contended that "we have all the resources to resist and all the strength to win."\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Here is a look at the deadly events on the night of Nov. 13, 2015, and their lasting consequences for the world.\n___\nWHAT HAPPENED: THE ATTACKERS, THE VICTIMS, THE CHAOS\nIt began with suicide bombings outside the Stade de France around 9:20 p.m., during a match between the French and German national soccer teams, with President Francois Hollande in attendance. Three bombers killed one passerby. If the attackers had made it past stadium security, the toll would have been much worse.\nWithin minutes, the shooting began in eastern Paris, as the cafes of the 10th and 11th arrondissements were booming with Friday night revelers. Six cafes were targeted by a three-man commando unit ? Le Carillon, Le Petit Cambodge, Cafe Bonne Biere, Casa Nostra, La Belle Equipe and the Comptoir Voltaire. More than 400 shots were fired over about 10 minutes, leaving 39 people dead.\nThen came the Bataclan concert hall, where 90 others lost their lives. Three attackers stormed the hall during a performance by the California rock band Eagles of Death Metal, spraying concert-goers with gunfire and hunting down others who were desperately trying to hide during a nearly three-hour standoff.\nAltogether 130 people were killed from 17 nations. Hundreds more were wounded and nine of them remain hospitalized today.\n___\nWHY FRANCE WAS TARGETED\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attacks, citing France's military operation against extremists in Iraq and Syria alongside U.S. and other forces. France has long been a favored target of religious fundamentalists because of its strict secularism, including laws banning Muslim headscarves in schools and face veils in public. Many of the attackers were French Muslims from communities frustrated by decades of failed integration efforts and entrenched discrimination.\n___\nHOW THE PARIS ATTACKS NETWORK CAME TOGETHER ? AND STRUCK AGAIN\nSeven attackers were killed the night of the attacks, either by blowing themselves up or being shot by police. Two others were killed in a police raid five days later. One key player escaped ? Salah Abdeslam ? and was arrested four months later in Belgium.\nBut other members of the network survived, plotting new violence from family apartments in Belgium and IS bases in Syria or Iraq. Days after Abdeslam's arrest, three attackers set off bombs in the Brussels airport and a Brussels subway train, killing 32 people. Those attackers also died and several suspects have been charged. The investigation continues.\n___\nFRANCE'S REACTION, CRACKING DOWN AT HOME AND ABROAD\nHollande quickly ordered new airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Syria, expanding France's military campaign to show the country wouldn't be cowed. Attackers with links or allegiance to IS have hit France repeatedly since then, including a truck rampage on Bastille Day in Nice that killed 86 people. Today, French warplanes and forces are involved in the battle to oust IS from strongholds in the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Syrian city of Raqqa.\nAt home, the French government declared a state of emergency that has been repeatedly extended and remains in place to this day, allowing greater police use of house searches and house arrest. Human rights groups decry the French measures as an over-the-top crackdown that foments suspicion and infringes on personal liberties.\n___\nQUESTIONS LINGER, AS SURVIVORS WORK TO HEAL\nMany questions remain about the Paris attacks. Two attackers' identities remain unknown, but it's believed they are Iraqis who entered Europe by hiding among the wave of Syrian refugees fleeing the war. There may be members of the original network still at large ? authorities have never enumerated how many were involved. And the mastermind hasn't been definitively identified. French and Belgian authorities suspect it may be Oussama Atar, a Belgian with a jihadi past whose current whereabouts are unclear.\nSome survivors are frustrated that the investigation is dragging on. Others, however, just want to move on. Survivors and families of the victims will gather Sunday for anniversary commemorations at each of the attack sites.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Once airborne, one of the Russian jets appeared to have mechanical difficulties and turned around in the direction of the aircraft carrier.\nThe Russian jet splashed down in the water while attempting to land. A Russian rescue helicopter picked up a parachute and the pilot, who'd bailed out safely, Russian defense officials said.\nThe MiG-29 was designed in the late-1970s to counter the U.S. Air Forceâ€™s F-15 and F-16. It entered service in the early 1980s.\nThe news of the crash came a day after state media claimed Russia was preparing its Tu-95 and Tu-160 long-range bombers for imminent strike missions in Syria. ?\nThe Russian Tu-95 â€œBearâ€? and Tu-160 â€œBlackjack,â€? according to their NATO call signs, have been operating in Syria since 2015 and are based at Engels Air Force base in southern Russia near Kazakhstan.?

"China should realize that our reflexes in Asia are not driven by territorial ambitions."\nOver U.S. objections, Beijing has moved to cement its claim to most of the South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and military airstrips atop coral reefs. With Trump's election, many analysts said Trump's isolationist foreign policy will give China more maneuvering room to pursue its territorial claims in the East and South China seas.\nDuring the election campaign, Trump in April said that China's building of man-made islands in the disputed waters was a sign of Beijing's disrespect for America.\n___\nNEW PHILIPPINE ENVOY TO CHINA SAYS DEAL POSSIBLE\nThe new Philippine ambassador to China says it's possible to achieve a settlement with Beijing in the disputed South China Sea.\nJose Santiago "Chito" Santa Romana says his country could learn from Vietnam and the former Soviet Union, which managed to reach a detente with China through good political relations and quiet diplomacy despite quarrels over territory.\nVietnam, however, continues to be entangled in the dispute over the Paracel Islands while making progress with China over other border issues.\n"The basic lesson is, if you use hardball tactics with China, expect the same. ... So when you say, 'What is ours is ours,' they will say the same thing. And if you don't yield, and if you combine it with just megaphone diplomacy and forcing your way, expect that there'll be a stalemate," he said at a forum in Manila organized by the state-run China Daily.\nHe said the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte is separating the disputes from economic relations with Beijing.\nDuterte's groundbreaking visit to Beijing resulted in China allowing Filipino fishermen back in the waters around the disputed Scarborough Shoal, which China seized from the Philippines in 2012, a year before Manila launched and won an international arbitration case against China's claims.\nHowever, China's coast guard has remained at the shoal and Filipinos are not allowed to fish inside the lagoon.\nSanta Romana said that Scarborough was just an "informal, friendly understanding," and there is a need to slowly formalize it and establish rules of engagement between the coast guards of the countries.\n"The Chinese, of course, still maintains their effective control because they have a sovereignty claim," he said. "But now the Philippine coast guard is trying to have a roving presence so that, eventually, we could say we have not given up our sovereignty claim when we resolve it diplomatically."\n___\nCHINA SAYS SOUTH CHINA SEA HAS STABILIZED\nChina says tensions in the South China Sea have eased because of "friendly cooperation" with the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations.\nForeign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang says managing differences through negotiations is "is back on the right track," the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\nLu noted that China has border treaties with 12 out of its 14 land neighbors, and that as long as they are "sincere and patient, most differences can be handled through consultation and negotiation."\n___\nFollow Hrvoje Hranjski at www.twitter.com/hatbangkok\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

(AP Photo/Vincent Thian) ?(The Associated Press)\nPrevious Next\nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia ? ?More than 10,000 yellow-shirt protesters rallied Saturday in Kuala Lumpur seeking Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's resignation over a financial scandal, undeterred by a police ban and the arrest of more than a dozen activists.\nPolice barricaded key roads in downtown Kuala Lumpur with water-cannon trucks on standby, but it did not stop the protesters. Some chanted "Save Democracy" and "Bersih, Bersih" ? the name of the electoral reform group that organized the rally. The name means "clean" in the Malay language.\nFormer Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has been spearheading calls for Najib's resignation, joined the rally, adding momentum to the demonstration.\n"Everybody feels concerned about the kind of government we have now," said Mahathir, wearing a yellow Bersih shirt. "The government is very cowardly, trying to prevent a demonstration, which is the right of the people."\nNajib, who is attending an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru, has kept an iron grip since corruption allegations emerged two years ago involving the indebted 1MDB state fund that he founded. 1MDB is at the center of investigations in the U.S. and several other countries.\nNajib, who has denied any wrongdoing, has said he won't be cowed by the rallies.\nIn a statement on his blog, Najib called Bersih "deceitful" and said the group has become a tool for opposition parties to unseat a democratically elected government.\n"We want to see Malaysia more developed and not robbed of billions of ringgit," singer Wan Aishah Wan Ariffin, an opposition supporter, said at the rally.\nBersih later told its supporters to move the rally outside the Kuala Lumpur City Center, one of the world's tallest twin towers, with police locking down Independent Square, where the protesters had been trying to gather. A smaller group of red-shirt pro-government supporters held a counter-rally in the city.\nPolice said in a statement that they raided the Bersih office on Friday and detained its chairwoman, Maria Chin, for investigation into "activities detrimental to parliamentary democracy."\nThirteen other people, mostly politicians and activists, were also held to prevent rioting, police said.\nThose detained included ruling party politician Jamal Mohamad Yunos, whose supporters trooped to downtown to counter the Bersih rally. Police have banned both events by Bersih's yellow-shirt supporters and Jamal's red-shirt group.\nBersih said on Twitter that three other activists were nabbed Saturday.\nIt later said Chin was formally detained Saturday under a security law and can be held for a further 28 days. The other activists were remanded for several days in police custody.\nThis marked the fifth rally organized by Bersih, which also held similar protests concurrently in two Malaysian cities on Borneo island. The last rally that Bersih organized in August 2015 also demanded Najib's resignation, attracting a crowd of 50,000 people, according to police estimates. Bersih said the number was much higher.\nHuman rights group Amnesty International slammed the crackdown and called for the immediate release of the Bersih activists, describing them as prisoners of conscience.\n"These arrests are the latest in a series of crude and heavy-handed attempts to intimidate Malaysian civil society activists and other human rights defenders," Amnesty said in a statement.\nThe investigations into 1MDB fund are centered on allegations of a global embezzlement and money-laundering scheme. Najib started the fund shortly after taking office in 2009 to promote economic development projects, but the fund accumulated billions in debt over the years.\nThe U.S. Justice Department said that at least $3.5 billion had been stolen from 1MDB by people close to Najib and initiated action in July to seize $1.3 billion it said was taken from the fund to buy assets in the U.S.\nThe U.S. government complaints also said that more than $700 million had landed in the accounts of "Malaysian Official 1." They did not name the official, but appear to be referring to Najib. Support for Najib's National Front has eroded in the last two general elections. It won in 2013, but lost the popular vote for the first time to an opposition alliance.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Officials could not confirm reports NATO jets intercepted those bombers.\nAmerican defense officials have described these missions as a way for Russia to â€œshow offâ€? its latest military hardware. While the Tu-95 â€œBearâ€? is a relic of the Cold War, the Russians have test fired new types of cruise missiles into Syria this week.?\nEarlier this week, Russian Su-33s saw combat for the first time in Syria, striking from an air base along Syriaâ€™s coastline. The jets initially flew from Russiaâ€™s only aircraft carrier, which is now in the eastern Mediterranean.\nRussiaâ€™s jets cannot take off with a full combat load of bombs and fuel, according to U.S. officials. Six Su-33s flew off the Admiral Kuznetzov aircraft carrier over the weekend and conducted strikes earlier this week.\nOther advanced MiG-29Ks have launched from the carrier, but they were forced to arm at the Russian air base ashore before carrying out their missions. These jets have been mostly flying escort for the strike aircraft, according to officials.?\nSo far, most of the Russian strikes have been in Hama, Homs, and Idlib Provinces where Syrian rebels, some supported by the United States, were fighting regime forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.\nAl Qaeda fighters on the ground in Idlib were fighting the regime as well. The United States has carried out multiple drone strikes in the past month to eliminate top Al Qaeda leaders there.\nLucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News Channel.

The video showed the bodies of four children lying shoulder-to-shoulder on the floor, each showing blue lips and dark marks around their eyes.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, however, which monitors the war, reportedly could not confirm that chlorine gas was used.\nThe Syrian government forces have used chlorine gas bombs ? made by oil drums filled with high explosives and dropped from helicopters ? at least three times during the war, the United Nations found, although government officials deny the charge.\nAt least 54 people were killed in bombing attacks on Saturday, and air strikes continued to hit several districts of eastern Aleppo on Sunday, the Observatory said.\nOn Friday alone, airstrikes hit four hospitals in east Aleppo, effectively rendering all hospitals in the enclave of 275,000 people out of service, according to the opposition's Aleppo Health Directorate and the World Health Organization.\nFootage obtained by the Associated Press shows what appears to be a waiting room at the hospital as people milled about, including nurses in blue uniforms.

In the case of foreign fighters, it could even allow them to live to fight another day in their homelands, including America.\n"The smoke is designed to dampen our vision. But this is more than normal, which means they are moving around the ISIS leaders," one Kurdish lieutenant commander told FoxNews.com from the front line wrapping around Shengal, also known as Sinjar. "And likely, their key Western fighters, too."\nWithin the ranks of the brutal terrorist organization, Western fighters ? especially those holding U.S. passports ? have held an esteemed position, if only for propaganda purposes. In the early days of ISISâ€™ rise, Westerners routinely got the nicest homes, their pick of Yazidi sex slaves and the freshest food.\nRelated Image\nExpand / Contract\nBlack smoke from burning tires rises in the distance as Peshmerga fighters keep watch from a post outside Mosul. (FoxNews.com)\nAccording to an FBI spokesperson, 250 Americans have "traveled or attempted to travel" to Syria or Iraq to join ISIS or other terrorist groups over the past few years. It is not clear how many made it, but the FBI reports a decrease in recent months. The slowing of all foreign recruits ? from a pinnacle of 2,000 per month to now less than 50 ? comes as a result of both stricter border controls in neighboring countries and evident ISIS battlefield losses, which hurts their resolve and enlistment efforts.\nAs the noose tightens around ISISâ€™ Iraq headquarters of Mosul, and international forces take aim at the terror armyâ€™s main stronghold of Raqqa, in Syria, U.S. intelligence officials are watching for American jihadists aiming to flee for their homeland. As it stands, around 8,000 total ISIS fighters, one-fifth foreign, are believed to still be inside the Mosul area alone.\nCol. Marwan Sabri, of the Yazidi Peshmerga battalion, recalled that in March this year, a disillusioned American surrendered, begging Kurdish fighters not to shoot at him. He turned out to be 26-year-old Mohamed Jamal Khweis from Virginia. He was extradited to the U.S. and is scheduled to stand trial in April.\n"The Americans are in the ranks," Sabri said.\nAnother high-ranking soldier affirmed that American accents have been heard on radio intercepts.\n"Some Americans were working intel and some were fighting. Some get to high positions, some have been killed," the source said. "And some, we think, are still alive."\nRelated Image\nExpand / Contract\nAl-Baghdadi may be in Mosul, or may be among the fighters who fled under cover of smoke. (Reuters)\nAccording to Brig. Gen. Sarhad Qader Mohammad, director of the Kirkuk Province Police Department, forces have "killed many" ISIS fighters, thought to be from the U.S., throughout the war's duration.\nMichael Pregent, an adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute, senior Middle East analyst and former intelligence adviser to Gen. David Petraeus, cautioned that Western fighters may now have new Muslim names and freshly-minted counterfeit passports, and could push its fighters into the refugee ranks without immediate detection.\n"These Western fighters have the ability to go back home after their deadly training," Pregent said. "And blend in."\nWhile the smoke hanging over the battlefield may be helping foreign fighters, including Americans, move undetected, the biggest target who may be inside Mosul is ISIS chieftain Abu Bakr Baghdadi. The locale of the 45-year-old is still a swirl of speculation, fueled by a string of alleged recent sightings in different places.\nKirkuk Police Gen. Mohammad told FoxNews.com that Baghdadi was seen less than two months ago in Mosul, discreetly visiting his troops in an effort to boost morale. Three weeks ago, he released his first audio message in more than a year ? addressing the Mosul operation and urging his eroding infantry to "stay and resist the apostates and unbelievers."\n"He moves frequently and very carefully, with family, avoiding the use of any technical communication, using tunnels," one Iraqi intel source noted. "And he has very good personal protection, mostly foreign fighters. He doesn't trust anyone outside his close circle."\nSince the beginning, Baghdadi's location has been a secret to leaders even within his own terrorist organization ? as have personal details pertaining to his life or background. Asking any questions about him too is strictly off-limits. ISIS jihadist and confessed bomb maker Jasim Mohammed Atti'ya, who held the leadership post of Amir before being captured by Kurdish authorities late last year, affirmed to FoxNews.com that it is "prohibited" for anyone to see Baghdadi.\n"It's very dangerous to meet him. I wouldn't want to meet him," Atti'ya said, his eyes nervously widening as if to suggest the self-styled Caliph was too almighty to meet on Earth.\nHe then recited the seeming propaganda they were fed about their ruler ? stressing that he was a "good leader," "a simple soldier" and "just like everyone else."\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

(AP Photo/Felipe Dana) ?(The Associated Press)\nPrevious Next\nTAL AFAR AIRPORT, Iraq ? ?A sandstorm is brewing west of the Iraqi city of Mosul, kicked up across a barren landscape by thousands of men and machines headed to war.\nTrucks, armored transports and even tanks carry fighters through a cloud of fine dust past a series of base camps and heavy weapons depots dotting the route to the front line against the so-called Islamic State.\nThese are the Shiite militias, and their goal is Tal Afar, on the main road to the Syrian city of Raqqa, the capital of IS' self-declared caliphate.\nCurrently a sideshow compared with the street-to-street fighting in Mosul, some 70 kilometers (44 miles) to the east, the battle for Tal Afar is certain to boost Shiite power. And its significance could be just as great ? if not greater ? for Iraq and the future of the region than the main battle for Mosul itself.\nOfficially, the Iraqi government and top militia leadership say that only Iraqi army units will enter Tal Afar, once dominated by Shiites but now primarily Sunni Turkmen, a minority in the country with cultural and historic links to nearby Turkey to the north.\nBut some of the militias' most powerful units, as well as field commanders and troops ? all backed by a newly empowered Iran ? tell a different story.\nJaafar al-Husseini, spokesman for Iraq's Hezbollah Brigades, said it is the militias backed by Shiite-heavy army units and Iranian weapons that will lead the charge into Tal Afar to drive out IS extremists.\n"The Iranians are with us," he said, adding that Tehran was supporting the militias directly, including strategy from Revolutionary Guards commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who is in charge of a crescent of Shiite power stretching from Tehran to Beirut.\n"Our mission and that of the (Iraqi Shiite) Badr Brigades is to encircle Tal Afar from the east. Then we will storm it," he said, adding that Soleimani visited a nearby staging ground three days ago.\nIraq's Shiite militias mobilized against IS in 2014. Since then, they have shown a growing determination to be a major force shaping the country.\nThe prospect worries Iraq's Sunni minority but also some officials in the military and the Shiite-led government, who fear the militias, bolstered by prestige from battles with IS, could one day dominate the country like the Revolutionary Guard does in Iran and the guerrilla group Hezbollah does in Lebanon.\nThe larger militias, like Asaib Ahl al-Haq, the Hezbollah Brigades, Badr and the Peace Brigades, emerged after the 2003 ouster of Saddam Hussein, and are linked to political parties. But their ranks surged after IS overran nearly a third of Iraq in 2014, and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's top Shiite cleric, called on able-bodied males to fight the militant group's Sunni extremists.\nThousands rallied to the militias late last month, bringing their strength to at least 15,000 men in the push toward Tal Afar to cut off IS supply lines west of Mosul. Their umbrella group, Hashd al-Shaabi, has agreed not to enter Mosul itself, but the same cannot be said of all groups when it comes to Tal Afar.\nOn the winding route through the desert, a relentless flow of pickup trucks and Humvees carried men bristling with weapons. The Iraqi flag was a rare sight; instead, most carried banners from various Shiite militias, with their distinctive font and iconography similar to that of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Lebanon's Hezbollah.\nThe deployment has not gone unnoticed in the region.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that the militias could prompt a Turkish response if they "terrorize" the area's Iraqi-Turkmen. Ankara has deployed tanks and other vehicles to Silopi, a Turkish town on Iraq's northern border.\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's official plan to have only the army enter Tal Afar played down the chance of an escalation, although the militias' actions may not.\nRights groups have accused the militias of abuses against civilians in other Sunni areas retaken from IS ? allegations the militia leaders deny. Residents of Fallujah said Shiite groups exacted revenge during operations to retake the Sunni city last summer, alleging Sunni Arab civilians who fled IS-held areas were detained, tortured and killed.\nErdogan's ire probably was directed more toward Iran. The two countries' rivalry extends to northern Syria, where Iranian-backed militias fighting alongside Syrian forces are competing with Turkish-backed opposition forces for supremacy around the northern city of Aleppo.\nTurkey launched Operation Euphrates Shield in August, partly to drive back Islamic State militants from its borders. But the rebels it backed have advanced south, raising alarm among hundreds of Shiite militiamen from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon trying to seize opposition-held eastern Aleppo.\nOutside Tal Afar, the commander who led the operation to retake its airport last week said forces in the area would not stand for any Turkish intervention.\n"We are Iraqis, and this is our country, and we consider any foreign intervention to be a provocation for us and our national sentiment," said Abu Taha Naser, "and God willing, this will not happen if the Turkish leadership is wise."\nShould the militias take the city, it would cut a main IS artery into Syria, where the militants already face a recent offensive by a Syrian Kurdish-led force. That would be another major blow for the retreating militants and a boost for Syrian President Bashar Assad, an ally of Iran. Tal Afar would then be the last of a string of Shiite cities and towns stretching from Iran across Iraq toward the Syrian border.\nNo matter who leads the offensive into Tal Afar, the Shiite forces will inevitably hold the city because they ? and not the Iraqi army ? are in the area by the thousands, said Dana Jalal, a Kurdish specialist on Iraqi militias.\n"Yes, they will enter Tal Afar, along with the Iraqi army's 92nd brigade," he said. "It's actually more the will of the Iraqi army and less that of the government."\nIraqi officials still deny that the military will play a secondary role to the militias or leave it in their hands once Tal Afar is taken. But a look at the army unit intended to join the militias in the days ahead raises further doubt that Iraq's central government will be the main force in the fight for the city.\nThe 92nd brigade, nicknamed the "Tal Afar Brigade," is made up almost entirely of Shiites from the city. But it also goes by another label: the "Hussein Brigade" ? named for the revered Imam Hussein, the Prophet Muhammad's grandson and a key figure in Shiite Islam.\nFlags featuring the Iman Hussein were a common sight on vehicles racing through the desert, with militiamen exclaiming, "On to Tal Afar!" At a provisions depot farther behind the front line, militiamen ate sandwiches while listening to hymns chanting the imam's name.\nWith the thud of incoming mortar rounds from IS positions and ricochets from sniper fire as a backdrop, militiaman Taha Naser was clear.\n"The priority is to cut the supply route between Tal Afar and Raqqa," he said, "and then to liberate the city of Tal Afar."\n___\nAssociated Press writer Qassim Abdul-Zahra contributed from Erbil.\n___\nFollow Brian Rohan on Twitter at www.twitter.com/brian_rohan\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Reuters reported Wednesday it had viewed the messages.\nIraqi troops pushed deeper into eastern Mosul Saturday, backed by aerial support from the U.S.-led international coalition -- but?faced stiff resistance from ISIS fighters,?Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi of the Iraqi special forces said.\nSAUDI-LED MILITARY COALITION DECLARES 48-HOUR CEASEFIRE IN YEMEN\nMeanwhile, al-Baghdadi "has cut down on his movements and neglects his appearance," according to the message from the person inside Mosul. "He lives underground and has tunnels that stretch to different areas. He doesn't sleep without his suicide bomber vest so he can set it off if he's captured."\nTwo weeks ago,?al-Baghdadi released a new message urging his followers to keep up the fight for Mosul. His rallying cry came in a sermon-like recording, more than half an hour long, distributed by the militant group's al-Furqan media arm. It was not clear when the recording was produced.\nThe city of more than one million people and the surrounding territory fell to ISIS fighters during the militant group's surprise attack in June 2014. Al-Baghdadi visited the city soon after the takeover, and from inside Mosul declared an Islamic caliphate that at one point covered nearly a third of Iraq and Syria.\nIn his recording, al-Baghdadi rallied his fighters ? especially in Mosul ? and called on them to obey orders while remaining resilient and steadfast.\n"Oh you who seek martyrdom! Start your actions! Turn the night of the disbelievers into day," he says, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. organization that monitors militant activity online, which reported the al-Baghdadi recording first.\n"Totally decimate their territories, and make their blood flow like rivers," al-Baghdadi also says.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

James Malloy, commander of the Eisenhower carrier strike group.\nFrom his office aboard the USS Eisenhower, Malloy described coalition success around Mosul while cautioning that victory is close at hand.\n"Mosul is the last large city in Iraq that is held by Daesh, but Daesh is by no means finished in Iraq, so our mission in Iraq won't end as Mosul falls," he said, using the Arabic acronym for IS.\nRelated stories...\nWhile inter-coalition coordination was "seamless," communication with Russia was limited to "deconfliction," Malloy said.\n"There's no coordination there because the goals are not the same," the admiral said.\nThe carrier's captain Paul Spedero said sorties from the Eisenhower have dropped nearly 1,100 bombs on IS targets since June when the ship entered the Persian Gulf after launching strikes from the eastern Mediterranean.\nThe ship's 5,200 sailors arm, repair, launch and recover 7-20 Super Hornet F18 fighter jets every day that drop on average 10 bombs each or reconnoiter in support of anti-IS coalition forces.\nThe crew catapults the jets from the ship at 145mph, and they use a hook and cable to rapidly catch the fighter jets on the 500-foot long carrier deck.\n"For a catapult shot, if you think about a Porsche 911, zero to sixty in about 2.5 seconds, these aircraft will go from 0 to 145 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds," said commander Jeremy Rifas, the carrier's air boss, from inside the ship's control tower overlooking launches.\nThe fighters on these sorties head north by northwest for an hour before refueling midair and then approaching coalition ground forces that provide the pilots with targets for airstrikes or reconnaissance.\n"They go into harm's way every single time, every single mission. I don't really close my eyes until 2300 when the last one comes back," admiral Malloy said.\nThe U.S.-led coalition has flown more than 125,000 sorties in Iraq and Syria since Operation Inherent Resolve began in Aug. 8, 2014, according to the US Department of Defense.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

And the billionaire businessmanâ€™s response is: So what?\nTrump shrugged off any hypothetical entanglements that could occur due to his worldwide real estate enterprise and asserted the law stood with him during a meeting with The New York Times on Tuesday.\nâ€œI mean, I know that from the standpoint, the law is totally on my side, meaning, the president canâ€™t have a conflict of interest,â€? Trump said . â€œâ€¦And I understand why the president canâ€™t have a conflict of interest now, because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of interest.â€?\nTRUMP REVERSES COURSE ON CLINTON, DEFENDS BANNON\nAccording to a Congressional Research Service report issued in October, Trump is right.\nâ€œBecause of concerns regarding interference with the exercise of constitutional duties, Congress had not applied [criminal penalties for conflicts of interest] to the President,â€? the report stated. â€œConsequently, there is no current legal requirement that would compel the President to relinquish financial interests because of a conflict of interest.â€?\nPredictions Map\nSee the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map â†’\nThe present model assumes the president will be tried in the court of public opinion before he takes office.\nâ€œIn other words, the current regulatory scheme suggests that any potential conflicts will be addressed by the electorate at the ballot box,â€? the report stated.\nThe majority of previous presidents ? Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush ? have voluntarily â€œdivestedâ€? any financial assets. President Obama did not, however, because his assets were tied up in Treasury notes and mutual funds he did not control, according to the report.\nTrump told The Times he is beginning to take steps to separate a President Trump from the Trump organization. He noted that heâ€™s â€œgreatly reducedâ€? signing checks and meetings with contractors and other interested parties. But Trump is acutely aware that he has no legal obligation to build a metaphorical wall between himself and his business.\nâ€œIn theory, I could run my business perfectly, and then run the country perfectly,â€? he said. â€œâ€¦But I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize something, because I donâ€™t care about my business.â€?\nThough heâ€™s been president-elect for fewer than three weeks, already several controversies involving potential conflicts have bubbled up ? and mostly petered out.\nTrump met last week with three Indian real-estate executives who are involved in building a Trump apartment complex in Mumbai. Trump said it was merely a congratulatory meeting and the men simply took a photo.\nDuring a Nov. 12 conversation with UKIP leader Nigel Farage, Trump allegedly brought up the topic of wind farms, the building of which Trump had previously tried to stop because the structures obstructed the view at one of his Scottish golf courses.\nâ€œI might have brought it up,â€? said Trump, who then detailed his long-time opposition to windfarms due to their effect on the bird population and because he said most are manufactured in Germany or Japan.\nAfter Trump spoke with the President of Argentina by phone after the Nov. 8 election, a report emerged from the country saying Trump brought up the topic of obtaining permits for an Argentinian office complex heâ€™s been trying to build. Both Trump and President Mauricio Macri denied the report and the source of the rumor later said he was joking.\nThe Trump International Hotel which opened in October in Washington, D.C. is, Trump admits, â€œa hotter brand than it was before.â€?\nâ€œI canâ€™t help that, but I donâ€™t care,â€? he told The Times.\nWhat will truly serve as a check on any potential conflicts, Trump said, is the chance he has to serve the nation and govern effectively.\nâ€œI donâ€™t care about my company. It doesnâ€™t matter. My kids run itâ€¦â€? Trump said. â€œThe only thing that matters to me is running our country.â€?\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

So large was the crowd on the road that Iraqi troops initially ordered them back, worried that an Islamic State suicide bomber could be hiding among them.\nMosul's residents are fleeing in growing numbers as Iraqi forces push deeper into the country's second largest city, and the battle-hardened extremists are fighting for every block, exploiting the dense urban terrain and using civilians as human shields.\nOn Wednesday the tide of displaced people reached the Samah district, where Iraqi medics treated dozens of wounded, including at least six soldiers.\nAt one point, four children and a man from the same family were rushed into the station, bleeding heavily as their relatives wailed in grief. A mortar round had slammed into the inner courtyard of their home. A few minutes after being brought to the aid station, a 16-month-old girl with a head wound was pronounced dead.\nThen the main rush came ? hundreds of civilians racing forward on a dirt road. The troops ordered them to halt, saying they had intelligence that ISIS might send suicide bombers disguised as civilians. One of the men raised his shirt to show that he wasn't armed, saying he was desperate for food.\nMosul, which fell to ISIS in the summer of 2014, is still home to more than 1 million people. Fearing a mass exodus, authorities have urged residents to stay inside their homes. But the presence of civilians has prevented the U.S.-backed Iraqi forces from using overwhelming force, slowing their advance and prolonging the city's agony.\nThe U.N. says at least 68,000 people have fled the fighting in Mosul, including 8,300 over the past four days.\nLater on Wednesday, Iraqi soldiers arrived from the front lines with a man who was bound and hooded. They said they had caught him burning tires to help the militants hide from airstrikes and the drones that buzzed overhead. Trembling, the man said he had been forced to aid the extremists.\nBlack Humvees carried wounded soldiers back from the front. The body of a special forces soldier killed in combat was wrapped in a blanket on the hood of a vehicle. The Iraqi military does not release official casualty figures, but field medics say dozens of troops have been killed and wounded since the Mosul operation began last month.\nMortar rounds, artillery and gunfire rang out throughout the day, punctuated by occasional booms from airstrikes that sent plumes of smoke into the air.\nA pre-dawn airstrike by the U.S.-led coalition struck a bridge across the Tigris River, which divides the city in two, leaving only one crossing intact and disrupting ISIS supply lines. It was the second bridge to be struck this week, and two other bridges were destroyed by airstrikes last month.\nUntil now, most of the fighting has been on the eastern bank of the Tigris. Iraqi forces are expected to use pontoon bridges when they reach the river.\nA spokesman for one of several state-sanctioned Shiite militias meanwhile said they had seized a road to the northwest of Mosul linking the city to Raqqa, the de facto capital of the ISIS self-styled caliphate. The militias have been converging on Tal Afar, an ISIS-held town west of Mosul that had a Shiite majority before falling to the extremists in 2014.\n"We have cut off Tal Afar from Mosul and we cut off Mosul from Syria," Jaafar al-Husseini, a spokesman for the Hezbollah Brigades, told The Associated Press.\nElsewhere in Iraq, more than a dozen small-scale attacks in and around Baghdad killed at least 31 people and wounded 103, according to police and health officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.\nISIS still regularly targets the capital despite suffering a series of battlefield losses elsewhere in the country over the past year.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Why Trump is drawing flak over emerging positions	2016-12-02 00:00:00	Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print\n?\nLetâ€™s imagine, in an alternative universe, that the media were as sympathetic to Donald Trump as they were to Barack Obama right after his election.\nThe coverage might look something like this:\nPresident-elect Trump has shown himself to be surprisingly inclusive in reaching out to former rivals who bitterly criticized him, including Mitt Romney, who called him a â€œfraud,â€? Nikki Haley, who questioned his disavowal of the KKK, and Rick Perry, who dubbed him a â€œcancer on conservatism.â€?\nPresident-elect Trump has called a temporary truce in his rhetorical war on the media, even venturing to the much-derided New York Times and describing the newspaper as a â€œjewel.â€?\nPresident-elect Trump has shown striking flexibility in rethinking some of campaign promises, abandoning his support for waterboarding, declaring an open mind on climate change and walking away from overheated threats to have Hillary Clinton prosecuted. He also agreed to keep two key parts of ObamaCare.\nEven before taking the oath, he appears to be growing into the job.\nNow of course such positive assessments would have to be balanced with more critical ones. One manâ€™s post-election evolution is another manâ€™s blatant flip-flop. A Politico headline : â€œ15 Trump Flip-Flops in 15 Days.â€?\nBut the positive analyses are, shall we say, muted.\nLetâ€™s face it, almost no one in the media expected Trump to win, and few are giving him the benefit of the doubt.\nI never believed that Trump, if he won, would seek a special prosecutor after Clinton had already been cleared by the FBI. It would look like he was seeking revenge against a rival at a time when heâ€™d have far bigger problems to tackle.\nThere has been some legitimate focus on disappointment on the right after all those â€œLock Her Upâ€? rallies. Breitbart, Steve Bannonâ€™s former outfit, ran a â€œBroken Promiseâ€? headline. But more common are a bunch of Should-Hillary-Be-Jailed-Or-Not cable segments.\nSimilarly, Trumpâ€™s evolving views on some issues have either been played down or drawn left-handed compliments, as in this column by CNNâ€™s Fareed Zakaria:\nâ€œOne might wonder why he didnâ€™t have that conversation during the campaign or why he pounded home the opposite views on all these topics for a year and a half. But at this point, it doesnâ€™t matter. Trump is president-elect. We should all hope that he flip-flops some more.â€? The liberal Zakaria had earlier called Trump a â€œcancer on American democracy.â€?\nFrom the right, Trump critic Kathleen Parker goes off on â€œDonald Trumpâ€™s many campaign lies. What else can one call the promises that he now treats as alien concepts?â€? Though she admits sheâ€™s happier with his new positions.\nAs for Trump trying to bring establishment Republicans into his tent, the press gave him some credit on Romney for an hour or two. But now the coverage is all about whether Romney critics and Rudy Giuliani fans can derail his nomination as secretary of State. Thatâ€™s a legitimate story, and the best horse race we have at the moment. But itâ€™s still incredible that Mitt is even in the running.\nAnd itâ€™s equally amazing that Nikki Haley, who was so critical of Trump during the campaign, was tapped as U.N. ambassador.\nOther big media narratives at the moment:\nShould Trump divest himself of his real estate empire to avoid conflicts of interest? Thatâ€™s a thorny question, and some of his properties were promoted, rather than hidden, during the campaign. But the truth is it would take years to sell off his hotels and golf courses, even if he wanted to. Still, the New York Times yesterday ran a zillion-word lead story on the subject.\nShould Jared Kushner play a role in his administration? There was much teeth-gnashing about whether Trump tapping his son-in-law would violate a nepotism law, but nothing prevents the president-elect from using him in an informal role. There are questions about his complete lack of government or diplomatic experience, but Kushner did help manage a winning presidential campaign.\nShould there be a recount in Wisconsin (and Michigan and Pennsylvania)? Trump has ripped Jill Steinâ€™s fundraising as a â€œscamâ€? and chided the Clinton campaign for cooperating, even though she didnâ€™t seek the recount and claims no evidence of foul play. But the story is somewhat overplayed because it wonâ€™t change who presides over the inauguration in January.\nI am all for aggressive coverage of new presidents. The relationship between the media and an incoming leader of the free world should always be adversarial. But anyone who thinks Trump is being covered the way President-elect Obama was has a very short memory.\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

But Dane County Circuit Court Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn concluded Stein's attorneys failed to show any hard evidence the machines were attacked and are unreliable.\nDonald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by about 22,000 votes in Wisconsin, but Stein has alleged -- without evidence -- that the results may have been hacked. She asked for a recount last week, saying the state needs to be sure.\nMore on this...\nWisconsin officials agree to proceed with vote recount, but not without 'full payment'\nThe Wisconsin Election Commission had to grant the request under state law but refused another Stein request that the commission order all county clerks to recount the votes by hand, leaving it up to the counties to decide how to conduct the process.\nStein filed a lawsuit seeking a judge's order for a hand recount. Hillary Clinton's campaign joined the action Tuesday, saying she has a stake in the results.\nState Department of Justice attorneys filed briefs Tuesday arguing that Stein hasn't shown how a hand recount would change the election's results. Elections Commission Administrator Mike Hass said only 19 counties plan to use electronic tabulators; the rest plan to count by hand.\nDane County Circuit Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn convened a hearing late Tuesday afternoon that went on four hours. Stein's side called computer experts who testified that Wisconsin's electronic machines are vulnerable to cyberattack but said they couldn't show whether one had actually occurred.\n"All that we have here is 100 percent hypothetical speculation about what could possibly happen. That's not convincing evidence," Assistant Attorney General S. Michael Murphy told the judge.\nBailey-Rihn ultimately sided with the state, finding that Stein and Clinton's lawyers failed to show any irregularities that prove electronic tabulators could be problematic in the recount.\nDebbie Greenberger, one of Stein's attorneys, told reporters after the decision that Stein would consider appeal options. In the meantime, she said hopes the counties take to heart the judge's remarks about a hand recount being the best way to proceed.\nInsideGov | Graphiq\nUnder state law, Stein is responsible for covering the costs of the recount. The commission initially estimated the recount would cost her $3.5 million but on Tuesday revised the cost estimate to $3.9 million. The commission required Stein to pay $3.5 million Tuesday and said she would have to cover any additional costs.\nStein has raised $6.4 million online since last week to cover recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. She griped about Wisconsin's costs being exorbitant but paid the money with five minutes to spare Tuesday. That payment cleared the way for the recount to begin Thursday.\nIndependent presidential candidate Roque De La Fuente withdrew his request for a Wisconsin recount Tuesday, saying the process would cost too much.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

They also argued that Stein waited so late to file her recount petition, which the candidate filed Wednesday, that it will be impossible to finish by the Dec. 13 deadline.\nâ€œStein, in fact, finished no higher than fourth in any state where she appeared on the ballot. Yet despite being just a blip on the electoral radar, Stein has now commandeered Michigan's electoral process,â€? they wrote in their filing .\n"[The law] has never been understood to permit challenges by bottom-dwelling (and thus not aggrieved) candidates like Stein," the argued.\nThe objections from Trump's team suspends the planned Friday start of the recount until next week. A recount is already underway in Wisconsin, and Stein is also pushing for a court-ordered statewide recount in Pennsylvania. Trump won Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the election ? all states that pollsters had predicted would go to Trumpâ€™s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\nMichiganâ€™s Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, backed the Trump campaignâ€™s arguments Friday, and asked the state Supreme Court to block the recount.\nStein blasted what she called Trumpâ€™s â€œcynical efforts to delay the recount and create unnecessary costs for taxpayers,â€? which she called â€œshameful and outrageous.â€?\nStein has argued, without any evidence, that irregularities in the vote suggests there could have been a cyberattack on voting machines that tampered with the vote. She says the only way to be sure is to verify the vote through a recount.\nExperts cast doubt on the efficacy of the recounts, saying that it was unlikely they would flip anything close to the number of votes to change the outcome in any of the states in question.\n"This is certainly not Bush v. Gore," Mike Haas,?Wisconsin's?chief elections administrator, told The Associated Press.\nThe?Wisconsin?recount was estimated to cost about $3.9 million. Stein paid $973,250 for the requested recount in Michigan.

"We are committed to this fight to protect the civil and voting rights of all Americans."\nAbady said barriers to a recount in Pennsylvania are pervasive and the state court system is ill-equipped to address the problem.\nGreen Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, raised over $6.9 million to fund recount efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Stein framed the issue as an effort to explore whether voting machines and systems had been hacked and the election result manipulated.\nStein announced Sunday morning that she plans to hold a rally on Monday morning outside of Trump Tower in New York.?\nRelated Image\nGreen Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein (AP)\nDespite Stein's lawyers having offered no evidence of hacking in Pennsylvania's election.\nThe state Republican Party and Trump asked for a dismissal in the state court case.\nThe decision came two days before a state court hearing was scheduled in the case.

Pennsylvania law does not allow a court-ordered recount, they argued, and a lawyer for the Green Party had acknowledged that the effort was without precedent in Pennsylvania.\nRepublican lawyers also argued that the case has threatened the stateâ€™s ability to certify its presidential electors by the December 13 federal deadline.\nOn Saturday, a GOP lawyer, Lawrence Tabas, said the case had been meant "solely for purposes to delay the Electoral College vote in Pennsylvania for President-Elect Trump."\nThe state's top elections official, Secretary of State Pedro Cortes, a Democrat, has said there was no evidence of any sort of cyberattacks or irregularities in the election. Cortes predicted that a recount would change few votes.\nAs of Friday, Trump's margin of victory in Pennsylvania was 49,000, or less than 1 percent, out of 6 million votes cast, according to state election officials.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: ?Iâ€™m Chris Wallace. ?\nPresident-elect Trump takes a victory lap and previews what's in store when he takes the oath of office next month. ?\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\nDONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENT-ELECT: ?Iâ€™m going to discuss our action plan to make America great again. ?\nWALLACE: ?And Trump is already acting, intervening to keep jobs in the U.S. and naming a retired marine general to lead the Pentagon. ?\nTRUMP: ?We are going to appoint "Mad Dog" Mattis as our secretary of defense. ?\nWALLACE: ?Then, insults fly when top officials from the Clinton and Trump campaigns meet at a Harvard forum. ?\nJENNIFER PALMIERI, CLINTON COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: ?I would rather lose than win the way you guys did. ?\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: ?No, you wouldn't. ?\nPALMIERI: ?Yes. ?Yes. ?Yes. ?\nWALLACE: ?We'll get the latest on that and the Trump transition live from top adviser Kellyanne Conway. ?\nThen, Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein, who's pushing for recounts in three states Donald Trump won narrowly. ?\nIt's a "Fox News Sunday" exclusive. ?\nPlus, we'll ask our Sunday panel what Democrats should do now after their members in the House re-elect Nancy Pelosi as their leader. ?\nAnd our power play of the week. ?Veterans training service dogs and healing themselves. ?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: ?A human/animal bond has worked better than any other intervention that Iâ€™m aware of. ?\nWALLACE: ?All, right now, on "Fox News Sunday."\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nWALLACE: ?And hello again from Fox News in Washington. ?\nThis week, Donald Trump demonstrated for any doubters still out there just how unconventional a president he will be. ?Intervening directly to keep a thousand jobs from going to Mexico, holding a campaign-style rally, where he continued to bash the media, and holding conversations with foreign leaders that break with decades of U.S. diplomacy. ?\nJoining me now from Trump transition headquarters in New York, Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump's top advisers. ?\nAnd, Kellyanne, welcome back to "Fox News Sunday."\nCONWAY: ?Thanks for having me, Chris. ?\nWALLACE: ?Let's start with the controversy over the call that Mr. Trump took this week from Taiwan's president, President Tsai. ?The first time leaders of our two countries have, to the best of our knowledge, spoken since the U.S. broke off relations in 1979. ?Now, you say that Mr. Trump was fully briefed, knew what he was doing before this call, which raises the question, does he intend to change a One China Policy, which recognizes only Beijing? ?\nCONWAY: ?Well, President-elect Trump is well aware of our One China Policy. ?He accepted a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan. ?That marks probably the 40th or 50th world leader that has reached out to the president-elect or the Vice President-elect Mike Pence since they won the election last month, Chris. They've talked to the prime ministers or presidents of Israel, Singapore, of Japan, of China. ?Obviously --\nWALLACE: ?But this one's different. ?The question, I guess, is, does this signal a change in policy, or was it just a phone call? ?\nCONWAY: ?It was just a phone call at this point. ?It signals the fact that he accepted a congratulatory call. ?I know that China has a perspective on it. ?The White House and State Department probably have a perspective on it. ?Certainly, Taiwan has a perspective on it. ?\nBut the president-elect's perspective is that he accepted a congratulatory call. ?When he's sworn in as president and commander-in-chief in a little over a month, Chris, he'll make clear the fullness of his plans. ?But people shouldn't read too much into it. ?And I -- some of the press coverage, not here necessarily, is really astonishing when you think about how it was covered when Barack Obama was going to try to reach out to Iran and come up with an Iran nuclear deal. ?\nThis man received -- the president-elect received a phone call from a world leader in another country. ?We know about one-China. ?He knows about one-China. ?He's routinely briefed on these matters. ?That just is what it is. ?\nWALLACE: ?So, let me ask you about this, and I think one of the reasons such a big deal was made of it is because of the fact that the president-elect has had a number of controversial phone calls with foreign leaders. ?He reportedly told Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif he would, quote, play any role you want me to play to address and find solutions to the country's problems, despite Pakistanâ€™s relationship with terrorists. ?He also spoke with Philippine President Duterte, who's been accused of ordering the murder of thousands of suspected drug dealers -- which raises the question, Kellyanne, why is Mr. Trump refusing the State Department's offer to brief him before these calls, and why is he skipping the daily briefings, intelligence briefings, that President Obama gets every day? ?\nCONWAY: ?He's not always skipping those briefings. ?He's briefed by any number of credible sources on these issues. ?I think people, Chris, frankly, are cherry picking about these world leaders. ?They're accusing the president-elect of somehow countenancing some of these behaviors in these other places. ?\nBut, look, that's really unfair when you think about we just had an election and the opponent, Hillary Clinton, who was the secretary of state, was using the State Department to get money from foreign governments like Saudi Arabia, which doesn't even respect girls and women. ?\nSo, itâ€™s -- I think people just have their hair on fire, particularly those who are still entrenched in the campaign, are trying to reverse the election results from last week. ?Let's give this man time to form his cabinet. ?He's also showing respect to the current president, President Obama, who's still the president for about 6 1/2 more weeks and the commander in chief, certainly. ?\nHe's not out there -- President-elect Trump is not out there making policy or announcing new policy prescriptions worldwide. ?He's merely taking phone calls. ?He will, Iâ€™m sure, reengage with many of these world leaders once he takes the oath of office. ?\nWALLACE: ?Kellyanne, speaking of people with hair on fire, last week, you went on several of the other Sunday talk shows to express the concern of Trump supporters about the consideration of Mitt Romney as secretary of state. ?\nHere's a clip. ?\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nCONWAY: ?Iâ€™m hearing from people saying, hey, my parents died penniless, but I gave $216 to Donald Trump's campaign, and I would feel betrayed. ?\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nWALLACE: ?I know that you say Mr. Trump gave you permission, but there's a bigger question, which is, is that a proper way to treat somebody who is talking about accepting a role in public service? ?\nCONWAY: ?Well, first, the president-elect has said he gave me permission. ?He's quoted in "The New York Times" and elsewhere saying that, and that's actually true. ?I would not say something publicly that I hadn't expressed privately. ?And I would never purposely embarrass him. ?He has my respect and my duty, frankly, my service. ?So --\nWALLACE: ?Iâ€™m not talking about Mr. Trump. ?Iâ€™m talking about Mr. Romney. ?Is that an appropriate way to treat a guy who is just discussing public service, to say people are going to feel betrayed? ?\nCONWAY: ?Well, first of all, Iâ€™m reflecting the news, not trying to make the news. ?I was astonished, Chris, that in a week when President-elect Trump told "The New York Times" on the record he would relook at waterboarding, he would relook at the Paris accords on climate change, he was not particularly interested in focusing on prosecuting Hillary Clinton any further because he was focused on health care and immigration. ?He understands that other agencies and individuals are charged with that responsibility. ?\nBut in a week when he said that, the breathtaking backlash was really about this particular prospective cabinet member. ?I would turn the question around and ask, was it appropriate for Governor Romney to stick his neck out so far in attacking Donald Trump? ?And never walking it back, never encouraging people to support the nominee once Mr. Trump had won the nomination squarely and fairly. ?\nSo, Iâ€™ve spoken my piece on that. ?And, certainly, the president-elect knows and I said publicly and will say here again, whatever he chooses and whomever he chooses has my full support and backing. ?\nWALLACE: ?But let me just -- ?\nCONWAY: ?He knows that. ?\nWALLACE: ?Let me just quickly follow up on that. ?Clearly, Romney is under consideration. ?We just showed a picture of them having dinner on Tuesday night. ?If Mr. Trump picks Romney, what are you going to say to those Trump supporters who are going to feel betrayed? ?\nCONWAY: ?Iâ€™m going to say to those Trump supporters what I say to those who did not vote for the new president-elect, Chris, some of whom seem to have a hard time accepting the fact he's their president. ?Iâ€™m going to say you have to work together. ?You have to accept his judgment. ?And the man is brilliant. ?\nThe man is the best negotiator. ?He's the best connector and communicator. ?Obviously, he just pulled off the upset of the century, perhaps. ?\nAnd the fact is, you have to trust his instincts and his judgment because itâ€™s what brought so many people along to his movement in the first place. ?And it's certainly what inspires me daily to work with him. ?\nSo, we -- everyone, I think I hope, will accept that. ?And

And while some stars have come around to the idea of giving Trump the benefit of the doubt, others are resisting the President-Elect at all costs.\nTom Hanks and Robert De Niro both publicly expressed their opinions before the election that Trump was not fit to be president. However since the win, the A-Listers have offered messages of hope.\nHanks said at a tribute from the Museum of Modern Art film department: â€œWe are going to be all right. America has been in worse places than we are at right now.â€?\nAnd after De Niro called Trump â€œstupid,â€? and a â€œpunkâ€? and that he would like â€œto punch him in the face,â€? he seems to have softened his tone.\nAfter receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom, De Niro said: â€œI would only say that weâ€™re all hoping, waiting and hoping, that he will lead the country in a way thatâ€™ll benefit everyone and benefit our neighbors around the world.â€?\nMiley Cyrus also came around to the idea of giving Trump a pass for now, posting a video to her Facebook a day after the election. Through tears, she said she would accept Trump as President, but added she still hopes to see Clinton become the first female president one day.?\nBut not everyone is taking a wait and see attitude.\nMany celebs ? including Mark Ruffalo, Debra Messing, George Takei ? urged fans to request audit of vote, hoping that the audit would prove Hillary Clinton had more votes than Trump.\nSally Field told Chelsea Handler on her Netflix show that she has no idea how he was capable of winning the election. She continued, â€œHe has shown to be everything that he accuses and has accused Hillary Clinton of being. It is now evident he is all of those things, every single thing that he accused her of.â€?\nNatalie Portman revealed to New York Magazine she is very upset with the results of the election but â€œextremely energized to get more involved.â€? While NBA star LeBron James, according to The Hollywood Reporter, refused to stay at Trump SoHo when the Cleveland Cavaliers went to play the NY Knicks.\nMadonna has also been vocal in not letting go of the election results. She told Billboard she felt â€œheartbreak and betrayal"?when she heard the results and that she feels betrayed by women who voted for the 70-year-old.\nBut Dan Gainor, VP of business and culture at the Media Research Center, said itâ€™s ultimately time for these actors to grow up and accept the results.\nâ€œConservatives have survived eight years of Obama and liberals, even from the Left Coast, can endure four or eight years of Trump," he said. "And if they really donâ€™t like that idea, they should follow George Lopez out the door. There are always more actors and actresses.â€? ?\nGainor says more celebrities need to learn a lesson from Mark Wahlberg.â€œHe said correctly that many actors are pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family. Heâ€™s right,â€? Gainor said. â€œAnd weâ€™re tired of being lectured by limousine liberals who spend more on their shoes than the rest of us do on our cars.â€?\nYou can follow Blanche Johnson on Twitter @blancheFOXLA .\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.
1171396	http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/29/recount-madness-jill-stein-launches-it-hillary-backs-it-trump-fuels-it.html	Recount Madness: Jill Stein launches it, Hillary backs it, Trump fuels it	2016-12-07 00:00:00	Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print\n?\nWhy on earth are we suddenly debating whether Donald Trump won the election, which he clearly did fair and square?\nYou can blame Jill Stein, Hillary Clinton's lawyers, and Trump himself.\nThis is just surreal, how a nuisance filing by a fringe candidate has suddenly become a massive media controversy in which nobody looks particularly good.\nThe whole notion of a recount is absurd. Clinton may have won the popular vote, but this isnâ€™t the hanging-chads environment of 2000. Trump has more than 300 electoral votes, and he will be the next president.\nSo along comes Stein, the Green Party candidate, and as a fundraising and attention-getting device, she successfully pushes for a recount in Wisconsin. This is, of course, ludicrous, since Trump won the state by more than 20,000 votes. (Stein is trying now in Pennsylvania, which Trump won by 70,000 votes.)\nClinton, who conceded on Election Night, had not asked for a recount. But her lawyer, while conceding the campaign has no â€œactionable evidenceâ€? of hacking or other illegalities, agrees to cooperate.\nAnd that ticks off Trump, who has clearly been smarting over the fact that Clinton leads by 2 million in the popular vote. Even though that doesnâ€™t amount to squat, since heâ€™s got more than 300 electoral votes.\nFirst Trump unleashed a tweetstorm at his Democratic opponent, quoting her as saying during the campaign that it would be â€œhorrifyingâ€? if Trump didnâ€™t accept the election outcome.\nThen came this: â€œIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.â€?\nMillions?\nThat created a firestorm. The Trump transition team offered no evidence of such widespread fraud. Communications director Jason Miller pointed to a two-year-old Washington Post blog by two academics saying 14 percent of non-citizens were registered to vote in past elections. (The piece also said â€œmost non-citizens do not register, let alone vote.â€?) But that doesnâ€™t prove anything about 2016. There are usually isolated episodes of voter fraud or chicanery, but not â€œmillions of people.â€?\nThe result?\nPolitico : â€œTrump's Baseless Assertions of Voter Fraud Called 'Stunning'â€?:\nâ€œDonald Trump on Sunday used the platform of the presidency to peddle a fringe conspiracy theory to justify his loss of the popular vote, claiming without evidence that millions of people voted illegally Nov. 8.â€?\nNew York Times : â€œTrump Claims, With No Evidence, That â€˜Millions of Peopleâ€™ Voted Illegallyâ€?:\nâ€œPresident-elect Donald J. Trump said on Sunday that he had fallen short in the popular vote in the general election only because millions of people had voted illegally, leveling the baseless claim as part of a daylong storm of Twitter posts voicing anger about a three-state recount push.â€?\nâ€œWashington Post : â€œTrump pushes conspiracy theory that â€˜millionsâ€™ voted illegally for Clintonâ€?:\nâ€œPresident-elect Donald Trump spent Sunday ridiculing Hillary Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign for joining a recount effort in Wisconsin, ending his day on Twitter by parroting a widely debunked conspiracy theory that her campaign benefited from massive voter fraud.â€?\nThe controversy prompted a Clinton campaign spokeswoman to say: â€œWinning the electoral college won him the presidency, so Trump's excuses on why he lost the popular vote by millions are just small and sad.â€? And Snopes debunks it here .\nAnd Trump wasnâ€™t done. Last night he launched a Twitter assault against CNN and its reporter Jeff Zeleny, retweeting attacks like this: â€œWhat PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes? Journalist? Do your job! @CNN "\nIn effect, he is now asking journalists to prove a negative, that he wasnâ€™t defrauded in the election.\nI have no idea why Trump went there. Heâ€™s in the process of putting together a government. He knows everyone would campaign differently if we picked presidents by popular vote. He knows that the recount is going to fizzle. Why give the media ammunition to again charge that heâ€™s making claims without evidence?\nIt feels like weâ€™ve been thrust back into the middle of the campaign. But itâ€™s a make-believe campaign. The real one ended on Nov. 8.\nMeanwhile, the press has descended on Kellyanne Conway, the former campaign manager turned top transition adviser. Sheâ€™s been going off on Mitt Romney in the secretary of State sweepstakes, first on Twitter and then on a couple of Sunday shows.\nThe gist of Conwayâ€™s argument, and she speaks for a strong faction within Trump world, is that Romney went out of his way to attack her guy during the campaign as a fraud and a con man, and shouldnâ€™t be rewarded with the Cabinetâ€™s top prize. Thatâ€™s usually the way politics works. In fairness to Mitt, he didnâ€™t lobby for the job?Trump had Mike Pence call him, and the president-elect and Romney are scheduled for a second sitdown today at Trump Tower.\nIs it unusual for advisers to be having this debate in public? Sure is. Conway has made clear that she has pressed her view privately with Trump as well.\nBut MSNBCâ€™s Joe Scarborough went off on her, accusing her of going rogue and pushing her own agenda, and saying that based on his own transition sources, Trump is â€œfuriousâ€? with her.\nConway sent a text, which Morning Joe read on the air, saying she can have whatever job she wants, inside or outside the administration, and that Scarboroughâ€™s account â€œis all false. And it is sexist.â€?\nConway told the New York Times that she and Trump are fine: â€œWhen heâ€™s upset with someone, they know it.â€? And in a statement, Trump called her a â€œtremendous assetâ€?: â€œKellyanne came to me and asked whether or not she could go public with her thoughts on the matter. I encouraged her to do so. Most importantly she fully acknowledged there is only one person that makes the decision.â€?\nIâ€™ll just say this: President-Elect Trump could shut off this debate in a heartbeat by saying heâ€™s no longer considering Romney or by naming Rudy Giuliani or David Petraeus or John Kelly or someone else. He has obviously decided that he wants the discussion to play out in public.\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Judge Mark Goldsmith rejected an effort by state officials to delay the hand-counting of about 4.8 million ballots.\nCelebrating that decision mere steps from Trump Tower, Stein cited concerns over â€œblank votesâ€? on some ballots. â€œWe will not give in to intimidation,â€? Stein said.\nThe fight turns next to Pennsylvania, where Steinâ€™s team said Monday they have gone to federal court to try to force a recount -- after the Green Party earlier dropped their case in state courts in the face of a required $1 million bond.\nâ€œWe have no choice but to seek federal intervention,â€? Stein counsel Jonathan Abady said Monday, announcing the Pennsylvania filing. He called for a tabulation of paper ballots and â€œforensic examinationâ€? of the stateâ€™s voting machinery.\nâ€œWe are here to verify the accuracy of the vote,â€? he said, calling criticism of their effort â€œdeeply misguidedâ€? and accusing Trump of trying to â€œobstruct and stop this democratic process.â€? ?\nThe outstanding question is what Stein hopes to accomplish.\nTrump tweeted Sunday that the push is â€œJust a Stein scam to raise money!â€?\nEven some Democrats are challenging her. Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and DNC chairman, said in a radio interview Sunday that Steinâ€™s efforts are a â€œwaste of time.â€?\nThe push also flies against what Stein said in October, in an interview with Fox News. At the time, Stein was asked if she would support Clinton or Trump as the choice of the people if they won.\nâ€œI would accept the results of the election . . . as flawed as our electoral system is. In my view, that's not where we need to put our energy into challenging the election of Hillary or Donald. On the other hand we need to organize so we do have effective political resistance," she said at the time. ?\nBut Stein, speaking on â€œFox News Sunday,â€? insisted the money is â€œgoing strictly into a segregated account which can only be spent on the recount,â€? and asked, â€œWhat is Donald Trump frightened of?â€?\nStein has said her intent is to verify the accuracy of the vote, while suggesting, with no evidence, that votes cast were susceptible to computer hacking.\nPresident-elect Trump narrowly defeated Democratic nominee Clinton in all three states. The recounts were not expected to change enough votes to overturn the result of the election.\nIn Wisconsin, state and local election officials have said they don't expect Clinton to surpass Trump in Wisconsin, where he won by about 22,000 votes.\nIn Michigan, Trump won by about 10,700 votes, or two-tenths of a percentage point, over Clinton. Stein received about 1 percent of the vote.\nAnd in Pennsylvania, an updated count Friday by state election officials showed Trump's lead shrinking to 49,000 from 71,000 over Clinton, out of 6 million votes cast, as more counties finish counting overseas ballots and settled provisional ballot challenges. That is still shy of Pennsylvania's 0.5 percent trigger for an automatic statewide recount. Stein drew less than 1 percent of the votes cast there as well. Final counts are outstanding in some counties, but there are not enough uncounted votes to change the outcome, officials say.\nMeanwhile, a recount of a sample of ballots has begun in Nevada, at the request of independent presidential candidate Roque De La Fuente.\nClinton won in Nevada, and De La Fuente finished last. But De La Fuente requested and paid about $14,000 last week for the recount, which he called a counterbalance to the review sought by Stein in Wisconsin. If the sample shows a discrepancy of at least 1 percent for De La Fuente or Clinton, a full recount will be launched in all 17 Nevada counties.\nFox Newsâ€™ Ray Bogan and The Associated Press contributed to this report.?\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

But while Trump narrowly defeated Clinton in all three states, the numbers trickling in look unlikely to call into question the Nov. 8 results.\nâ€œIn any election, the actual change in the margin of votes is very, very low,â€? Drew Spencer Penrose, legal director at FairVote, told FoxNews.com. â€œFor people hoping for a change in results, I wouldnâ€™t hold my breath.â€?\nHereâ€™s a rundown of what is happening in each state:?\nRelated Image\nExpand / Contract\nA worker looks over results during a statewide presidential election recount Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, in Milwaukee.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)\nWisconsin\nWith the Wisconsin Election Commission working since last Thursday ??when Stein paid $3.5 million for the recount after alleging reports of fraud ? there has been little change so far to the unofficial results reported on Election Day. Trump won the state by 22,000 votes over Clinton.\nIn a twist, Trump is gaining.?\nBy Wednesday morning, Trump had widened his victory margin over Clinton in Wisconsin by 146 votes, with 23 of the state's 72 counties having finished their recounts as of Tuesday. In those counties, Trump gained 105 votes and Clinton dropped 41 votes.\nStein, who received about 1 percent of the vote in the states under question, said her intent was not to help Clinton, but to verify the accuracy of the count as she believed the votes were susceptible to computer hacking.\nâ€œWeâ€™re not finding any problems with the machines,â€? Reid Magney, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, told FoxNews.com. â€œThe Stein campaign wanted a recount because they thought there was some problems with our machines and that was not the case.â€?\nWhatever Steinâ€™s reasons, it appears the recount has been more of a help than a hindrance to Trump, who saw the number of votes for him go up in several counties.\nIn Green Lake County, which sits about 100 miles northwest of Milwaukee, the unofficial results from election night had Trump winning with 6,213 votes to Clintonâ€™s 2,701. The recount found that Trump actually received 6,216 votes while Clinton lost eight votes to finish with 2,693.\nAnd in those counties where Clinton picked up votes on Trump, Wisconsin officials said the number was not enough to influence the results.\nRelated Image\nBallots are unloaded during a statewide presidential election recount in Waterford Township, Mich., Monday, Dec. 5, 2016.

Magney said. â€œItâ€™s two votes here, two votes there.â€?\nThe remaining counties in the Badger State have until Dec. 12 to recount their votes in order for Wisconsin to certify its results by the following day, and ensure they count when the Electoral College votes on Dec. 19.\nMichigan\nA statewide hand recount of Michiganâ€™s roughly 2.8 million ballots that began on Monday is now up in the air as a federal judge?will hold a hearing Wednesday on whether to stop it.\nThe state elections board also is meeting Wednesday, a day after the Michigan appeals court ordered it to dismiss Stein's recount petition, claiming she has no standing. The court noted that she received 1 percent of the vote and has no chance of catching Trump, who narrowly defeated Clinton in the state. A federal judge takes up the matter next.?\nAccording to the certified results from late November, Trump won the state by about 10,700 votes ? or about two-tenths of a percentage point. The recount so far was looking at eight counties, including the stateâ€™s largest, Wayne.\nA controversy also is brewing in that county as officials said Tuesday that one-third of precincts could be disqualified from the recount because of problems with ballots.\nWayne County ? home to Detroit ? overwhelmingly voted for Clinton late last month, but officials couldnâ€™t reconcile vote totals for 610 of 1,680 precincts during a countywide canvass of vote results. During the canvass, the number of ballots in precinct poll books did not match those of voting machine printout reports in 59 percent of precincts, 392 of 662.\nRelated Image\nExpand / Contract\nParticipants listen to a speaker at a rally at the Pennsylvania Capitol in support of a Green Party-backed quest for a recount of Pennsylvania's Nov. 8 presidential election, Monday, Dec. 5, 2016, in Harrisburg, Pa. (AP Photo/Marc Levy) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)\nMichigan state law prohibits precincts whose poll books donâ€™t match with ballots from recounting votes.\nDespite the issue in Wayne County, experts say it will have little effect on the results in Michigan, or nationally.\nâ€œThey are not going to affect the decision, but the discrepancy certainly warrants further investigation,â€?

While his legacy inspires fierce adulation by many of the nation's citizens, others continue to grumble about Cuba's autocratic government, inefficient bureaucracy and stagnant economy.\nRelated stories...\nCastro's death leaves lingering uncertainty ahead in U.S.-Cuban relationship\nRural Cubans' lives have improved with the arrival of doctors and teachers in once-ignored backwaters, but it has been a struggle to earn a living under the island's one-party socialist government and its stifling economic rules.\nBut those realities were seemingly not at the forefront for the throngs crowding the 2-mile route the Russian jeep traveled to Santa Ifigenia cemetery.\nCastro's tomb stands to the side of a memorial to the rebel soldiers killed during a 1953 Castro-led attack on Santiago's Moncada barracks. Castro's final resting spot is in front of the mausoleum of Cuban national hero Jose Marti.\nThe Cuban military fired a 21-gun salute and crowds at the entrance to the cemetery sang the national anthem as the ashes entered about 40 minutes later. The ceremony lasted more than an hour and took place out of the public eye after Cuban officials made a last-minute cancellation of plans to broadcast the events live on national and international television. International media were also barred from the ceremony.\nThe decision to hold a private ceremony came the morning after Castro's brother, President Raul Castro, announced that Cuba would prohibit the naming of streets and monuments after the former leader, and bar the construction of statues of the former leader and revolutionary icon, in keeping with his desire to avoid a cult of personality.\n"The leader of the revolution rejected any manifestation of a cult of personality and was consistent in that through the last hours of his life, insisting that, once dead, his name and likeness would never be used on institutions, streets, parks or other public sites, and that busts, statues or other forms of tribute would never be erected," Raul Castro told a massive crowd gathered in the eastern city of Santiago.\nHe said that Cuba's National Assembly would vote in its next session on the law fulfilling the wishes of his brother, who died last week at 90. The legislature generally holds a meeting in December and under Cuba's single-party system, parliament unanimously or near-unanimously approves every government proposal.\nFidel Castro, who stepped down in 2006 after falling ill, kept his name off public sites during his near half-century in power because he said he wanted to avoid the development of a personality cult. In contrast, the images of his fellow revolutionary fighters Camilo Cienfuegos and Ernesto "Che" Guevara became common across Cuba in the decades since their deaths.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

If convicted, he would be barred from running for public office.\nPutin hasn't said whether he will seek a fourth presidential term in the March 18, 2018 election, but he is widely expected to run.\nFormer Kremlin insider Gleb Pavlovsky said the announcement could push Putin toward a decision to run because any other Putin-loyalist candidate would struggle to win against Navalny.\n"Navalny is not just announcing his intentions but throwing down a challenge to the current president," Pavlovsky told the Interfax news agency.\nNavalny said he would push to redistribute wealth, fight corruption, invest more in education and health, decentralize Russian politics, reform the country's judiciary and pull back from involvement in foreign wars.\n"It's time for us to choose not only a person at elections. It's time to choose between stagnation and a program of development," Navalny said in his video address.\nThe development received little coverage by state-owned television stations, which are almost universally pro-Kremlin and how most Russians get their news.\nExperts said that Navalny's decision to launch a campaign was a shrewd political move that put the Kremlin off stride. Navalny can now pressure authorities into allowing him to officially register his candidacy.\n"Now everything that happens in the process going forward won't happen in a vacuum, but will be an answer (to Navalny's presidential bid)," political analyst Yekaterina Shulman wrote on Facebook.\nNavalny, a trained lawyer, heads the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which publishes extensive exposes about the personal wealth and alleged corruption of Russian officials.\nBut he has no experience in public office. He shot to prominence with his often-bitingly sarcastic blog entries about corruption and exposes of corruption among the Russian elite. He played a leading role in the massive anti-Putin demonstrations in 2011 and 2012.\nIn 2013, Navalny organized a crowd-funded campaign to challenge Sergei Sobyanin, the incumbent pro-Putin candidate, in Moscow's mayoral election. He surprised many observers by finishing in second place with almost 30 percent of the vote.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

First came the suicide car bombs, and then the hospital was surrounded by hundreds of militants firing bursts of heavy machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades.\n"We thought we were going to die, all we could think about was saving our lives," Pvt. Mithad Abdulzahra of the Iraqi army's 9th Division said later, as he recovered in a hospital bed in the nearby city of Irbil from gunshots that shattered his right arm. The IS fighters eventually fought their way inside the al-Salam hospital. Of the 100 or so Iraqi soldiers trapped there, nearly all were killed or wounded, he said.\nSeven weeks into the Iraqi operation to retake Mosul, IS fighters are still contesting every block of Iraq's second largest city, and the battle will likely continue well into next year. The battle for the al-Salam hospital highlights the challenges Iraqi forces face as they move deeper into the city.\n"Every time we would fight off one unit of IS fighters, another would appear," said Col. Haider Hatem, who was wounded early on by a sniper's bullet. He said he called in U.S.-led airstrikes but was told that the IS fighters were so close that hitting them from the air would endanger his forces.\nOver the next 24 hours, the IS fighters unleashed 15 suicide car bombs.\nOn Wednesday morning, Iraqi special forces were pulled away from another front in eastern Mosul and tasked with launching a rescue mission. The elite force has served as the tip of the spear in the Mosul offensive, but has also taken heavy losses. The special forces eventually fought their way to the hospital, opening up a route of retreat for the embattled soldiers of the 9th Division.\n"When we reached them, they barely had any bullets left," a special forces officer said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters.\nAs Iraqi forces retreated, U.S.-led warplanes hit both the hospital and the abandoned Iraqi army vehicles. IS often uses hospitals as bases to fire on Iraqi troops. The coalition says it is reluctant to strike them for fear of damaging vital infrastructure.\nCol. John Dorrian, a coalition spokesman, said the strike was carried out at the request of Iraqi ground forces and the hospital was hit because IS fighters were using it to fire down on Iraqi troops.\nIn all, more than 20 Iraqi soldiers were killed in the battle, and a handful of armored Iraqi vehicles were captured by IS, the special forces officer said. An IS video posted online Thursday showed what appeared to be about a dozen destroyed Iraqi army vehicles near the al-Salam hospital. The video could not be independently verified.\nThe battle for the Mosul is the biggest operation Iraq has carried out since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, and comes just two years after Iraqi forces crumbled in the face of the lightning IS advance in the summer of 2014.\nIraqi forces have retaken a number of cities and towns over the past year, but few units have experience in urban combat. The 9th Division is an armored force, designed for conventional battles against other armies on open terrain. Iraq's special forces are better equipped for the street battles in Mosul, but there aren't enough of them to retake the city on their own.\nAbdulzahra, the soldier who was hospitalized after the battle, says he doesn't believe his commanders will learn from their missteps. "Of course these mistakes will keep happening," he said. "They happen every time."\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

(AP Photo/Hadi Mizban) ?(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)\nQAYARA AIR BASE, Iraq ? ??Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition forces have killed or gravely wounded more than 2,000 Islamic State fighters in the battle for Mosul since October, the top U.S. commander in Iraq said Sunday.\nLt. Gen. Stephen Townsend told reporters there are still an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 IS fighters defending Mosul. He applauded the efforts of Iraqi security forces, who began their offensive on Oct. 17 in what has been billed a decisive phase of the anti-IS fight.\n"By our calculations, we think we have killed or badly wounded over 2,000," Townsend said at a joint news conference with U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter at Qayara air base.\nTownsend disputed any suggestion that the Islamic State has managed to fight the Iraqi government forces to standstill in Mosul.\nAfter citing the estimated 2,000 IS casualties, he added, "I don't think that suggests anything about a stalemate. This is a major urban area. Any army on the planet, including the United States Army, would be challenged by this fight."\n"The Iraqi army has come back from near-defeat two years ago, and now they are attacking this major city 400 kilometers (about 250 miles) from Baghdad," Townsend said. "I don't think there is anything in there about a stalemate."\nTownsend said U.S. intelligence estimated before the Mosul campaign kicked off in October that IS had 3,500 to 6,000 fighters in the city. He said the current estimate is 3,000 to 5,000.\nUS officials have declined to say how many Iraqi government troops have been killed in the Mosul fight.\nCarter made an unannounced visit Sunday to the Qayara base, flying in from Baghdad after meeting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and sharing lunch with American troops. It was Carter's first visit to Qayara since it began operating as an Iraqi staging base in October.\nCarter toured the air base, greeting soldiers and offering holiday wishes. He assured them the Mosul campaign is on track.\n"Everything is going according to the plan of a year ago," Carter said\nSunday's visit came as Iraqi security forces have been slowed in their nearly two-month-old offensive against IS, which has occupied Mosul for more than two years.\nIn Bahrain on Saturday, Carter announced he is sending another 200 troops to Syria to train and advise local fighters combatting IS. There are already 300 U.S. troops authorized for the Syria effort, and some 5,000 in Iraq.\nThe recapture of Mosul, the country's second largest city, is crucial to the Iraqis' hopes of restoring their sovereignty, although political stability will likely remain a challenge afterward.\nCarter told an international security conference in Bahrain that the battle for Mosul and for the Syrian city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremists' self-described caliphate, would be crucial for defeating the group, which has claimed attacks worldwide.\n"The seizure of these two cities is necessary to ensure the destruction of ISIL's parent tumor in Iraq and Syria ? the primary objective of our military campaign ? and put ISIL on an irreversible path to a lasting defeat," he said, using another acronym for IS.\nHe did not predict how long it might take for Iraqi forces to prevail in Mosul, but he sounded a note of optimism.\n"This is a complex mission that will take time to accomplish, but I am confident that ISIL's days in Mosul are numbered," he said in Bahrain.\nIraqi forces have only captured a handful of eastern Mosul neighborhoods since launching the offensive in mid-October. On Sunday they came under mortar fire as they worked to clear villages along the Tigris River to the south, part of operations to secure supply lines for a campaign that is likely to stretch into the coming year.\nCarter, whose tenure as defense secretary will end in January if his designated successor ? retired Marine Gen. James Mattis ? is confirmed by the Senate as expected, also made the case for keeping U.S. forces in Iraq even after the Islamic State group is dislodged from Mosul.\n"Beyond security, there will still be towns to rebuild, services to re-establish, and communities to restore," he said in Bahrain. The extremists, he predicted, will attempt to survive by reinventing themselves "in some other shape or form" after they lose their grip on Iraq and Syria.\nIn Baghdad, six separate bombings targeting mostly streets and markets frequented by civilians killed 12 and wounded more than 30 people Sunday, according to Iraqi police and hospital officials. IS claimed responsibility for one of the attacks in southern Baghdad in a statement posted by the group's Amaq news agency. All Iraqi officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to brief the press.\nLeft unaddressed by Carter during his visit to Iraq was a possible change in course under President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office next month.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World
1187511	http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/14/report-says-isis-is-manufacturing-arms-on-industrial-scale.html	ISIS is manufacturing arms on industrial scale, report finds	2016-12-14 00:00:00	ISIS is manufacturing arms on industrial scale, report finds\nPublished               December 14, 2016\nFacebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print\n?\nThe Islamic State terror group was manufacturing weapons in and around Mosul on an industrial scale with products largely bought in bulk from Turkey, according to a report published by an arms research group Wednesday.\nThe findings showed that ISIS maintained a "robust and reliable" supply chain between Turkey and Iraq that allowed the fighters to produce tens of thousands of weapons, the London-based Conflict Armament Research said. The group's researchers studied ISIS weapons found at manufacturing facilities and on the battlefield during the Iraqi operation to retake Mosul that is underway.\nAs Iraqi forces advance, the extremists are losing the physical capacity to manufacture weapons on an industrial scale, but the research group's executive director James Bevan warned that highly trained fighters will take their expertise with them as they retreat.\nMore on this...\nBosnia preparing for return of ISIS fighters\n"Given that this group is so organized, they clearly see the writing on the wall in Mosul," Bevan told The Associated Press, saying he believes ISIS has already moved its highest trained bomb-makers out of Mosul and into Syria and southern Turkey.\n"They place a very high value on technical capacity and they will do everything they can to preserve it," he said. Bevan added that ISIS fighters likely looked to Turkey to purchase weapons ingredients, knowing that their demand would outstrip what is available in Iraq.\nIraqi forces have been met with stiff resistance in Mosul, including waves of suicide car bombs, since launching an offensive to retake the city in October. They have retaken less than a quarter of the city since the operation began.\nFor many among Mosul's Sunni Arabs, rule by the Sunni militants of ISIS initially seemed a respite from what they considered the heavy hand of Iraq's Shiite-led central government in Baghdad. As Iraqi soldiers vanished in those first few weeks, people were simply happy to see hated security checkpoints pulled down and traffic moving smoothly along streets lined with low, pale buildings. Sunni insurgents have long been active in Mosul, and Baghdad's clampdowns against them usually only fueled residents' distrust.\nBut even as families strolled in the parks and shops stayed open, signs emerged that this group of fighters was unlike past insurgents who had worked strictly underground. They were staying put: Trucks began hauling office furniture to various government buildings, according to a blog called "Mosul Eye," written by a resident who took on the role of city historian.\nSeveral weeks later, the group declared its "caliphate" stretching across its territory in Syria and Iraq.\nWithin a month, the homes of Christians and other minorities were tagged with official stickers -- for "statistical purposes," ISIS officials said, according to Mosul Eye. Christians and Shiites soon fled, leaving their marked homes and belongings behind.\nKurds were soon targeted as well. "If you turned in a Kurdish family, they gave you a car," said Hassan Ali Mustapha, a retired prison guard. He said he moved into a home deserted by a Kurdish family, after the family asked him through a mutual friend to do so to keep Islamic State from taking it over.\nMustapha walked with a heavy limp through the camp that is his family's new home. They made their escape from Mosul first on foot and then by Iraqi government truck.\nThe group imposed the extreme, severe vision of Islamic law across its zone of control. Dress was strictly regulated, and clothes manufacturers were told to report to Islamic State offices to receive the acceptable measurements. Women were required to hide their faces and don black down to their fingertips. The fine for violations -- even as small as the wrong kind of stocking -- was 25,000 dinars, around 20 dollars. Repeat offenders got lashes.\nThere was another, widely feared punishment as well: The women's brigade of religious enforcers used a metal-toothed device to deliver vicious, deep "bites" on women they deemed as dressing improperly, according to two women.\nPunishments were often public, and in a central square the group printed broadsheets proclaiming how it would respond to disobedience. In one case, according to a witness, there was a gleeful description of "criminals" being shoved into a commercial oven to roast to death.\nThe militants took a cut of all business through fees, fines or taxes. Even roadside hawkers had to pay ISIS according to the size of the sheet on the ground where they displayed their wares -- $12 per square meter. As they described indignities piling up, the camp residents dragged their feet in the dust to show just how small a space could be taxed.\nResidents learned to keep a mental tally of all the different rules -- and find ways to dissent.\nThe most symbolic was the widespread refusal to send children to the schools, which the extremists took over.\nMosul prides itself on an ancient history of knowledge. Near the center of the city are the ruins of the city of Nineveh where stone tablets more than 3,000 years old were discovered in a library, inscribed with the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh, considered humanity's oldest surviving work of literature.\nBut in the ISIS schools, lessons were about guns and warplanes. Mathematics courses couldn't use a plus symbol because it resembled a Christian cross. Mosul's biggest libraries were ransacked over a number of weeks, beginning in late 2014, and the extremists set up bonfires to torch books on science and culture, according to accounts at the time.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Saturday that as many as 200 more American troops are being sent to Syria to help Kurdish and Arab fighters capture the Islamic State group's key stronghold of Raqqa.\nThe extra troops will include special operations forces and are in addition to 300 U.S. troops already authorized for the effort to recruit, organize, train and advise local Syrian forces to combat IS.\nAddressing a security conference in Bahrain, Carter also took gentle jabs at U.S. Middle East partners for failing to provide more military muscle in the broader campaign to defeat IS and counter extremism.\nWithout mentioning any by name, Carter suggested the U.S. has been the target of disingenuous criticism from "regional powers here in the Middle East" for not doing more to help fight extremism.\n"I would ask you to imagine what U.S. military and defense leaders think when they have to listen to complaints sometimes that we should do more, when it's plain to see that all too often, the ones complaining aren't doing enough themselves," he said.\nHe said it is not unreasonable for Washington to expect regional powers who oppose extremism in the Middle East to do more to help fight it, "particularly in the political and economic aspects of the campaign."\nMore on this...\n50,000 ISIS militants killed in past 2 years, senior US official says\nCarter noted that many Sunni-led Gulf countries have expressed concern about the spread of Iranian influence in the region.\n"The fact is, if countries in the region are worried about Iran's destabilizing activities - a concern the United States shares - they need to get in the game. That means getting serious about starting to partner more with each other, and investing in the right capabilities for the threat."\nCarter said the 200 extra troops going to Syria will help local forces in their anticipated push to retake Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremist group's self-styled caliphate, and to deny sanctuary to IS after Raqqa is captured.\nHe said President Barack Obama approved the troop additions last week.\n"These uniquely skilled operators will join the 300 U.S. special operations forces already in Syria, to continue organizing, training, equipping, and otherwise enabling capable, motivated, local forces to take the fight to ISIL," Carter said in his address to the IISS Manama Dialogues in the Bahraini capital, using an alternative acronym for IS.\n"By combining our capabilities with those of our local partners, we've been squeezing ISIL by applying simultaneous pressure from all sides and across domains, through a series of deliberate actions to continue to build momentum," he said.\nThe military push is complicated by the predominant role played by local Kurdish fighters, who are the most effective U.S. partner against IS in Syria but are viewed by Turkey -- a key U.S. ally -- as a terrorist threat.\nA senior defense official said the troop boost announced by Carter will give the U.S. extra capability to train Arab volunteers who are joining the Raqqa push but are not well trained or equipped. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of internal Pentagon planning.\n?\n	foxnews	World

(AP Photo/Kristy Wigglesworth) ?(AP2012)\nSinger George Michael, who sold more than 100 million albums over a pop music career spanning almost four decades, has died at the age of 53, his publicist said Sunday.?\nMichael died at his home in Goring, England. His publicist, Cindi Berger, said he had not been ill. Michael's manager, Michael Lippman, says the cause of death was heart failure. His family issued a statement through Thames Valley Police saying that he "passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period.\n"The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage."\nBefore Lippmann's announcement, police issued a statement calling the death "unexplained but not suspicious" and that "a post mortem will be undertaken in due course."\nThe loss of Michael continues a year of grief in the music industry, with David Bowie, Prince and Glenn Frey among those dying before age 70.\nOne of the giants of `80s and `90s music, and an early idol for the MTV generation, Michael?enjoyed immense popularity early in his career as a teenybopper idol, delivering a series of hits such as "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go," "Young Guns (Go For It)" and "Freedom." As a solo artist, he developed into a more serious singer and songwriter, lauded by critics for his tremendous vocal range. He earned numerous Grammy and American Music Awards, and recorded duets with legends like Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Luciano Pavarotti and Elton John.\nThroughout his career, his drug use and taste for risky sex brought him into frequent brushes with the law, most famously in 1998 when he was arrested for public lewdness in Los Angeles. Yet, he managed to turn the incident into fodder for a popular song that poked fun at his behavior, and his acknowledgment of his homosexuality at that time made him even more popular with his fans.\nMichael, with startling good looks and an easy stage manner, formed the boy band WHAM! with his school friend Andrew Ridgeley in the early 1980s. Helped by MTV, which was an emerging music industry force at the time, the cheerful duo easily crossed the Atlantic to become popular in the United States with Michael, as lead singer, usually the focal point.\nHe started his solo career shortly before WHAM! split, with the release of the megahit single "Careless Whisper," making a seamless transition. Critics generally viewed his WHAM! songs as catchy but disposable pop and gave his solo efforts far higher marks.\nHis first solo album, 1987's "Faith," sold more 20 million copies, and he enjoyed several hit singles including the raunchy "I Want Your Sex," which was helped immeasurably by a provocative video that received wide air play on MTV.\nThe song was controversial not only because of its explicit nature, but also because it was seen as encouraging casual sex and promiscuity at a time when the AIDS epidemic was deepening. Michael and his management tried to tamp down this point of view by having the singer write "Explore Monogamy" on the leg and back of a model in the video.\nAt the time, Michael had not disclosed his homosexuality, and much of his chart success was based on his sex appeal to young women. His look was raw and provocative, with tight jeans, tight T-shirts, black leather jackets and designer stubble, and his videos pushed the accepted limits with many lingerie-clad models vying for Michael's attentions on screen.\nBut Michael's situation changed abruptly in 1998 when he was arrested for lewd conduct in a public toilet in Los Angeles after being spotted by a male undercover police officer.\nThe arrest received international media attention, and seemed for a brief time to jeopardize Michael's stature as a top recording artist.\nBut instead of making excuses for his behavior, he went on to release a single and video, "Outside," that made light of the charges against him and mocked the Los Angeles police who had arrested him.\nLike all of his efforts at the time, it sold in prodigious numbers, helping him put the incident behind him. The arrest also prompted him to speak openly about his sexual orientation.\nThese years represented the height of Michael's commercial success, which at times was marred by a protracted legal dispute with his record company Sony.\nHe remained a strong musical force throughout his career, releasing dozens of records and touring to adoring crowds despite a growing number of run-ins with police, many of them stemming from a series of driving-under-the-influence-of-drugs incidents, including several crashes.\nMichael was an admitted user of marijuana and prescription sedatives and several times was found slumped over his car's steering wheel after using both at the same time.\nHis driver's license was finally revoked for five years in 2010 after Michael drove his Land Rover into the side of a Snappy Snap photo shop with so much force that his vehicle dented the wall.\nA passer-by remembering Michael's early career wrote the word WHAM on the spot his SUV had hit.\nHe was also arrested a second time in public toilets -- this time in North London in 2008 for drug use, an incident that prompted him to apologize to his fans and promise to get his life in order.\nHe also offered an apology to "everybody else, just for boring them."\nA year earlier, he had told a television interviewer that his problems stemmed from a self-destructive streak and his attention-seeking nature.\nHe said at a press conference in 2011 that he felt he had let young people down with his misbehavior and had made it easier for others to denigrate homosexuals.\nDespite these personal setbacks, Michael's musical performances remained strong even as his material moved farther from the teen tunes that first brought him to stardom.\nThe Telegraph newspaper in 2011 described a London concert appearance as an impressive event, calling his voice, "A rich, soulful instrument, it's capable of serious emotional heft, expertly matching the confessional tone of his own material."\nMichael, with strong Greek-Cypriot roots, was born Georgios Panayiotou in England. He and schoolmate Ridgeley formed a ska band called the Executive when they were just 16 before moving on to form WHAM!\n"I wanted to be loved," said Michael of his start in the music field. "It was an ego satisfaction thing."\nMichael was active in a number of charities and helped raise money to combat AIDS, help needy children, and support gay rights. He had a long-term relationship with Kenny Goss, but announced onstage in August 2011 that the two had broken up.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

One witness remembered a commotion as an armed official yelled at the 21-year-old University of Virginia undergraduate student from Ohio and had him hauled out of the terminal. Hours later, the rogue dictatorship issued a vague update: A tourist had been â€œcaught committing a hostile act against the state.â€?\nThe legal proceedings that followed were just as vague. Prosecutors charged that Warmbier was caught stealing a political sign and committed â€œcrimes against the state.â€? He was given a one-hour trial in March at which the government presented fingerprints, CCTV footage and pictures of a political banner to make its case against the American.\nâ€œI beg that you see how I am only human,â€? Warmbier begged at trial. â€œAnd how I have made the biggest mistake of my life.â€?\nDespite his pleas, Warmbier?was convicted , and sentenced to 15 years' hard labor. In a post-trial video released to the world, Warmbier, under obvious duress,?praised his captors for his treatment and for handling of the case â€œfair and square."\nLittle is known about Warmbier's fate over the last year, and critics say the Obama administration has not done enough to bring the American home.\nIn recent years, several U.S. citizens have been held on trumped-up charges for varying periods of time by the current regime of Kim Jong Un, as well as that of his father, Kim Jong Il. Their release has typically been won by pledges of aid or diplomatic gestures from American dignitaries. Former President Bill Clinton journeyed to the Hermit Kingdom in 2009 in a successful bid to convince the late Kim Jong Il to release of Current TV journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling , who had been captured after straying across the border from China and held prisoner for five months.\nThe younger Kim is less predictable, and the U.S. has no formal diplomatic relations with North Korea. Kim Jung Un, the third generation of his family to lead the impoverished and belligerent nation, routinely issues threats against the U.S., ?launches missiles to provoke South Korea and Japan, e xecutes top military officials and, occasionally, seizes Western prisoners. Although they are subjected to what passes for judicial procedures, they are for all intents and purposes, hostages.\nIn addition to Warmbier, it is believed that Pyongyang is holding Kim Dong-chul, 62, a naturalized U.S. citizen and a Canadian. Like Warmbier, he was charged with spying.\nGordon Chang, an expert on Asia and author of â€œThe Coming Collapse of China,â€? said autocratic regimes, like the one in Pyongyang, are famous for their insecurities and treat any slight against its government as an especially serious offense. An Irish national who visited the country told The Independent that he was told â€œconstantly that the smallest thing was considered a hostile attack.\n"I bought lots of magazines and books there, and we were told not to fold them in a way that creased Kim Jong-unâ€™s face,â€? he recalled.\nChang believes the North Koreans are taking reasonably good care of Warmbier, but the student likely feels forgotten.\nâ€œI assume he feels isolated,â€? Chang said. â€œHeâ€™s likely only reading propaganda and feels abandoned by the outside world.â€?\nWarmbier's family, including his father, Fred, did not respond to requests for comment, perhaps out of concern that publicity could anger Warmbier's captors or upset back-channel efforts by the State Department or private parties to win his release.?The U.S. will often tell these families to avoid talking to the media so it can better control the situation, Chang said.\nâ€œI agree with that,â€? he said.\nYet, media attention in the past seemed to work favorably in some cases. Ling and Lee faced 12 years of hard labor for committing hostile acts, yet were freed after five months when a visit from Clinton seemed to provide the rogue regime with the diplomatic legitimacy it craved, at least under the elder Kim, who died in 2011.\nKenneth Bae, a 47-year-old missionary who spent 19 months in prison for evangelizing, was released in 2014 after former NBA star and self-professed pal of Kim Jong-un Dennis Rodman took up his cause.?Bae, who worked on a soybean farm and lost 30 pounds during the ordeal, told The New York Times that his interrogators would tell him that nobody in the U.S. cared about him and there were no negotiations.\nFriend Trey Lonneman: We need to get Otto #Warmbier back. We must keep him in the public eye as much as we can ?TCT #Tucker @FoxNews\n? Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) December 20, 2016\nHe said he was questioned â€œfrom 8 in the morning until 10 or 11 oâ€™clock at night, every day for four weeks," yet his treatment was better than that of North Korean felons.\nBae told FoxNews.com?that he prays daily for American prisonersâ€™ release from North Korea.?\nFormer U.S. ambassador to the UN and ex-New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, founder of the nonprofit Richardson Center for Global Engagement , told Fox News that the progress in getting Warmbier back has been slow but said North Koreans accepted a delegation from his foundation in September. He said the White House has been supportive of his group's efforts.\nâ€œWeâ€™re trying to do this on a humanitarian basis,â€? Richardson told Fox News, â€œnot a government-to-government basis.â€?\nCommunicating with North Korea has long been more challenging under the younger Kim.\nâ€œThereâ€™s just silence,â€? he said. â€œThereâ€™s nothing coming back.â€?\nJulia Mason, a State Department spokeswoman, told FoxNews.com a statement that the administration is aware of the situation, and â€œnow that Mr. Warmbier has gone through this criminal process, we urge the DPRK to pardon him and grant him special amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds.â€?\nIn November, the Associated Press reported that a North Korean Foreign Ministry official met with the Swedish ambassador to talk about access to Canadian Christian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim, who was sentenced to life in prison with hard labor, according to Pyongyangâ€™s official Korean Central News Agency.\nThe Swedish ambassador used the meeting to also talk about the Americans and was reportedly told Pyongyang treats them as war prisoners, possibly in light of U.S. sanctions on the country.\nJohn Bolton, a Fox News contributor and the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told Fox Newsâ€™ Tucker Carlson that North Korea keeps a close eye on U.S. relationships around the world. It likely made note of the Obama administrations clandestine payments to Iran earlier this year which coincided with the release of four Americans held by Tehran on bogus charges.\nâ€œWhen Obama pays $1.7 billion in ransom for four people being held hostage in Iran, obviously the North Koreans see this as a bargaining chip as well,â€? he said.\nEdmund DeMarche is a news editor for FoxNews.com.

According to the latest reports, Fisher suffered a cardiac arrest while flying from London to Los Angeles last week. Witnesses reported that she began to have chest pain and became unresponsive while in flight. CPR was performed and an AED was used to restart her heart.\nShe arrived at LAX and was transported urgently to the hospital.? There have been no reports that Fisher had any prior heart disease or risk factors for heart disease outside of cigarette smoking and up and occasional issues with weight.\nCarrie Fisher had a long history of substance abuse and, according to some reports, she had recently relapsed. Some believe that this may have been a contributing factor in her untimely death. ?\nAccording to the American Heart Association, two thirds of women who die suddenly of heart disease have no previous symptoms?making prevention even more difficult. ?Unfortunately, only 54 percent of women recognize that heart disease poses their greatest risk of death.\nWomen and Heart Disease\nHeart disease, while long thought to be a disease of men, actually affects both genders equally. ?In fact, more women than men die from heart disease in the United States every single year.\nIn 2013 nearly 289, 000 women died of heart disease?that is one in four American women.\nHeart disease can be more difficult to recognize in women than in men and many women do not even know that they are at risk.\nWhile men tend to present with â€œclassicâ€? heart attack symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath, women often have very atypical symptoms including nausea, back pain, flu like illness and feelings of dread.? Many times, women who are having heart attack symptoms do not even realize that they are having a heart attack.\nWhat are the Risk Factors for Heart Attack in Women?\nThe risk factors for heart disease are similar in both men and women.? There are two types?those that we can modify and those that we cannot.\nModifiable risk factors include: Smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.\nThose that we cannot change are our genetic makeup?having a family history of heart disease.\nOne of the most important things that women can do is to take stock in their own cardiovascular health.? If a woman has multiple risk factors, then screening tests are appropriate.? It is vital that women engage with their health care provider and determine exactly what their risk is?once risk is known, steps can be taken to reduce risk and screening tests can be performed.\nHow can Women Prevent Heart Disease?\nPrevention is all about knowledge ? every woman must know her numbers. Here are five numbers to keep track of:\n1. Have your blood pressure checked annually.? Hypertension is known as the silent killer.? While you may not have symptoms from high blood pressure, long-standing hypertension can damage your heart and blood vessels and put you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke.? If you and your physician are able to identify high blood pressure early, you can limit the negative effects of hypertension by treating with lifestyle modifications and drug therapy if needed.\n2. Have cholesterol checked annually. Most heart attacks are caused by a build up of fatty plaques inside the heart arteries.? When these plaques rupture and occlude a coronary artery, a heart attack occurs.? Cholesterol contributes to the development of these plaques.? By checking your cholesterol annually you can assess your risk and your physician can put you on drugs to lower your cholesterol if necessary.\n3. Maintain an optimal body weight?Assess your body mass index (BMI) and make changes to diet and exercise regimen in order to attain a more healthy weight.? Make healthy food choices.? Obesity leads to generalized inflammation and inflammation has been directly associated with the development of heart disease.? In addition, obesity puts you at risk for Type 2 Diabetes as well as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and ultimately heart disease.\n4.? Lower your stress levels. Studies have shown that stress can increase the incidence of heart attack in susceptible individuals.? Emotional stress evokes a hormonal response in our bodies.? When under stress, we release increased amounts of stress hormones including epinephrine and cortisol.? These hormone raise blood pressure and heart rate.? Chronically elevated levels of these hormones can lead to heart attack and stroke in susceptible individuals.? Daily stress lowering strategies such as meditation, exercise and relaxation breathing can make a huge difference in limiting your levels of these hormones.\n5. Stop smoking. Smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in the United States today.? While smoking rates have declined over the last several decades, far too many Americans still continue to smoke.? Smoking can cause damage to the heart and blood vessels and can significantly raise your risk for heart attack.? Smoking raises blood pressure, decreases exercise capacity and increases the tendency for blood to clot.? Smoking may be the most important risk factor for heart disease in young women.? If you are a smoker, quit today.? Your doctor can help if you need medications?set a quit date, circle it on the calendar and make your goal public.? Ask friends and family for support.\nThe Legacy of Princess Leia\nCarrie Fisher has done much good in her short life and has brought joy into many lives through her work on film.? Now that she has passed away from a heart attack at a young age, letâ€™s continue to allow Carrie to impact our lives.? Letâ€™s raise awareness for women and heart disease. Letâ€™s help spread the word that a womanâ€™s greatest health risk today is from heart attack and stroke.? While breast and uterine cancers remain a significant concern, heart disease takes the lives of one in four women annually.? In â€œStar Wars,â€? Princess Leia fought for a cause that was greater than any one person?letâ€™s let Carrie Fisherâ€™s legacy be one of hope. ?Hope that women can now recognize their risk for heart disease and make the changes needed to take control of their own heart health.\nDr. Kevin Campbell is an assistant Professor of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of North Carolina and ?President, K-Roc Consulting LLC.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

Democrats and Republicans alike ? to mitigate the damage this resolution has done and ultimately repeal it," he said.\nNetanyahu said that while he sought peace, his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas, has walked away from peace offers "time and time again."\nEarlier Wednesday, Kerry sparked the diplomatic showdown when he questioned Netanyahu's commitment to Palestinian statehood. Though Netanyahu has said he believes in the two-state solution, Kerry said Netanyahuâ€™s government is â€œthe most right-wing in Israel's history.â€?\nâ€œIf the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic, it cannot be both, and it won't ever really be at peace,â€? Kerry said.\nAbbas in a statement "reiterated his commitment to a just and lasting peace as a strategic option," saying Palestinians would resume negotiations?"the minute the Israeli government agrees to cease all settlement activities."\nNetanyahuâ€™s office, however, immediately slammed Kerryâ€™s speech as "skewed against Israel" and "obsessively" dealing with the issue of Israeli settlements.\nNetanyahu spoke shortly after the Israeli Attorney Generalâ€™s office approved a police probe of the prime minister in two separate cases, The Times of Israel reported, citing Channel 10. A Netanyahu spokesman had previously told Haaeretz the case was "nonsense."\nIsrael's Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also panned Kerry's speech.\n"To coordinate anti-Israeli initiatives with the Palestinians at the U.N. and to advance a one-sided resolution against Israel in the Security Council is the opposite of supporting Israel," Danon said. "The Obama Administration acted against Israel at the U.N. and any claim to the contrary is a distortion of reality."\nAlmost immediately after Kerryâ€™s speech, Netanyahu posted to his Facebook page a 2008 image of Obamaâ€™s visit to Israel alongside two captions: â€œ2008: Presidential candidate Barack Obama at the Western Wall; 2016: UN calls the Western Wall â€˜occupied Palestinian territory.â€™â€?\nâ€œSeriously?â€? Netanyahu wrote.\nFox Newsâ€™ Ben Evansky, Yonat Friling and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World

In a previous tweet, Wilders blamed â€œcowardly Government leadersâ€? for instituting â€œopen bordersâ€? that had allowed a â€œtsunamiâ€? of Islamic terror to enter Europe.\n? Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) December 20, 2016\nâ€œThey hate and kill us. And nobody protects us. Our leaders betray us. We need a political revolution. And defend our people. #BerlinAttack,â€? Wilders tweeted early Tuesday.\nMerkel was named Time magazineâ€™s 2015 Person of the Year, largely due to her acceptance of nearly a million mostly Muslim asylum seekers. But even though Merkel eventually shut off that spigot of Syrian refugees, terror attacks ? both planned and executed ? and sexual assaults in Germany have been traced back to the migrants.\nAuthorities have not released a description of the suspected driver of the truck that ploughed into a Berlin crowd on Monday, killing at least 12 and wounding 50, but officials have said theyâ€™re treating the incident as an act of terrorism.\nMerkel has said she is â€œshocked, shaken and deeply saddenedâ€? by the attack and told reporters it would be â€œparticularly sickeningâ€? if the perpetrator was an asylum-seeker.\nThe Berlin attack could stall any momentum Merkel may have had as she looks to win a fourth term as chancellor. A nationalist party leader already proclaimed the 12 killed in the attack as â€œMerkelâ€™s dead.â€?\nWilders, 53, began his political career in 1997 and has attracted attention ? and controversy ? due to a series of statements and actions concerning Islam.

It was not clear if the video was made before or after the Berlin attack.\nExpand / Contract\nAmri pledged his loyalty to ISIS in an undated video. (MEMRI screengrab)\n"My message to crusaders bombing Muslims everyday... Their blood will not go in vain," he said. "We are a nation behind them and will take revenge for them," he said.\n"I call on my Muslim brothers everywhere... Those in Europe, kill the crusader pigs, each person to their own ability."\nAfter the shootout in Italy, the ISIS website confirmed via Twitter that the dead man was Amri.\nItalian Interior Minister Marco Minniti told reporters at a news conference that the dead man was "without any doubt" Amri. Monday's attack in Berlin, for which ISIS has claimed credit, left 12 dead and more than 50 injured, including two Americans.\nThe shootout occurred just after 3 a.m. local time, according to Italian police . Amri was seen "walking suspiciously," sources said, and was asked for identification. He pulled a .22 calibre gun out of his backpack and fired at a cop, police said. The police officer, identified as Critian Morio, was struck, but his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.\nMorio and another police officer who was not injured "have done an extraordinary service to the community," Minniti said.\nAuthorities are retracing Amri's three days on the run, a trek that could raise even more questions about border security throughout Europe. After fleeing Germany, he made his way to the French region of Savoy and then took a train to Milan, according to Italian news agency ANSA.\nGerman investigators were en route to confirm the identification, which Italian authorities reportedly made by matching the dead man's fingerprints to those taken from the cab of the hijacked truck Amri turned into a tool of terror.\nItalian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni told reporters he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about the shootout.\nAmri had been in Italy before, having entered in 2011 amid the earliest wave of refugees from the Middle East and Northern Africa that has engulfed the continent. While there, he set a school on fire and served four years in prison, yet managed to remain in Europe when Tunisia refused to take him back.\nIn Germany, he had also been on police radar, reportedly having researched bomb-making and making contact with ISIS through the messaging service Telegram. German authorities sought to deport him in June, but failed to in a disastrous bureaucratic lapse that has enraged critics of Merkel's refugee policy.\nGerman police initially detained an innocent man after Monday's attack, then launched a European-wide wanted notice for Amri on Wednesday. German authorities had offered a reward of $105,000 for information leading to Amri's arrest, but warned he could be "violent and armed."\nAuthorities say Amri has used at least six different names and three nationalities in his travels around Europe.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	World
