A change.org petition that calls for Averyâ€™s pardon has also gained 268,000 signatures and counting since going live in December.\nDespite all the conversation and attention, the show hasnâ€™t drawn hordes of tourists to the county to see its setting, like Magnolia Bakery did for â€œSex and the Cityâ€? and Tomâ€™s Restaurant did for â€œSeinfeld.â€?\nBut, at least as compared with pre-â€?Murderer,â€? there is a bit of new interest in the area.\nâ€œBetween 25 to 40 vehicles have come up my driveway,â€? Chuck Avery, Stevenâ€™s brother, tells The Post of visitors who have motored up to Averyâ€™s Auto Salvage ? the family business in Two Rivers where Steven worked ? in the past few weeks. But they donâ€™t stay for long. â€œThey turn around,â€? Chuck adds.\nBut one Arkansas couple who recently visited neighboring Sheboygan County actually dropped by the shop to bring the Averys two pizzas for dinner and to give Stevenâ€™s mother, Dolores, a big hug.\nDoes this mean that more and more travelers will head to the salvage yard to pose for photos and treat the location as a spectacle?\nâ€œIâ€™m kind of wary about that,â€? Chuck admits.\nOf course, the few intrepid fan-travelers have captured their show-related sightings on Instagram.\nA photo posted by Matt Bacaling (@bacaling) on\nJan 3, 2016 at 11:15am PST\nJason Ring, the president of the Manitowoc Area Visitor & Convention Bureau ? whose 3,000-square-foot center draws 25,000 to 30,000 travelers annually ? says he believes itâ€™s possible for these â€œMurdererâ€?-inspired visits to increase.\n	foxnews	U.S.

So far, the family has reportedly collected $2,100 raised though the site and says an additional $1,200 has been sent to their home.\nTMZ reports the money will be used for legal fees and a private investigator.\nBut Ken Kratz, who prosecuted Avery, is fighting back with what he says is evidence that the Netflix docu-series ignored.\n[SPOILER ALERT: The following contains spoilers from "Making a Murderer."]\nKratz sent nine separate points to the TheWrap.com , including the claim that Avery told an inmate during his 18 years in prison that he was planning on building a "torture chamber" so he could rape, torture and kill young women upon his release. Kratz said the inmate also revealed Avery told him the best way to get rid of a body was to "burn it" because heat destroys DNA evidence. The body of the photographer Avery was convicted of murdering, Teresa Halbach, was found burned at Avery's Auto Salvage.\nKratz also told TheWrap.com that Halbach's phone, camera and PDA were found 20 feet from Avery's door, burned in his barrel, but said the documentary did not include this information.\nKratz suggested that Avery "targeted" Halbach citing phone records that show three calls from Avery's phone to Teresa's phone the day she was last seen. The prosecutor said that Halbach was "creeped out" by Avery who allegedly opened his door "just wearing a towel" when she visited his property for a photo shoot for AutoTrader magazine.\n"She [went to her employer and] said she would not go back because she was scared of him," he told People magazine in an e-mail.\nAvery claims that police planted the evidence and framed him for Halbach's murder. However, Kratz countered that Avery's DNA was found under the hood of Halbach's car.\n"How did his DNA get under the hood if Avery never touched her car? Do the cops have a vial of Avery's sweat?"\nAvery's defense team alleged that the blood found in Halbach's car may have been planted from an 11-year-old vial of Avery's blood.\nAvery's defense attorneys also claim that the bullet recovered at Avery's garage was planted by police, which Kratz denies.\n"Ballistics said the bullet found in the garage was fired by Avery's rifle, which was in a police evidence locker since Nov. 6, 2005," Kratz told People. "If the cops planted the bullet, how did they get one fired from [Avery's] gun? This rifle, hanging over Avery's bed, is the source of the bullet found in the garage, with Teresa's DNA on it. The bullet had to be fired before Nov. 5."\nKratz resigned from his position as Calumet County District Attorney in 2010 following a sexting scandal. He admitted to sending suggestive messages to a crime victim. He said he had a prescription drug problem at the time and said it's "exceedingly unfair to use that to characterize me as morally unfit" in "Making a Murderer."\n"Making a Murderer" filmmaker Laura Ricciardi disputed Kratz's claims that the film was made as part of Avery's defense and left out key facts that would cast Avery in a bad light.\nâ€œOur opinion is that we included the stateâ€™s most compelling evidence,â€? Ricciardi, who made the film with Moira Demos, told The New York Times .\nThe filmmakers said they offered to interview Kratz for the film, but that he declined. He said he did so because he didn't think the film was balanced.\nAvery previously spent 18 years in prison for sexual assault before he was exonerated and released in 2003 based on DNA evidence.

Using the subtitled phone chats, strangely compelling cello sounds and Wisconsin accents that make "Murderer" so distinctive, the clip chronicles a staff member's attempt to get Meyers to come back to "30 Rock."\n"Yah, Seth? the unknown voice says. "Yah, you gotta come back. Ya know?"\n"I've only been out two weeks," Meyers says. "Supposing I don't wanna come back."\nThe bit ends with a photo of Meyers rocking a bushy beard that makes him look like man-of-the-moment Steven Avery.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

And what's next?\nQ: SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?\nA: Avery made national headlines in 2003 when he was released after spending nearly two decades behind bars after being wrongfully convicted of rape. Two years later, Avery and Dassey were charged with killing Halbach, who visited the Avery family salvage yard to take photos of a minivan on Halloween. Her bones and belongings were found burned near Avery's trailer. Both were convicted and sentenced to life terms, but only Dassey is eligible for parole ? in 2048.\nQ: WHY HAS THE DOCUMENTARY BEEN SO POPULAR?\nA: Its release was impeccably timed. It was released before Christmas, while much of the nation was on holiday break and had time to delve into a 10-hour series. Also, it comes on the heels of the popular podcast "Serial," which lays out a complex legal case and has generated intense social media participation.\nQ: WHAT EXACTLY IS IN THE DOCUMENTARY?\nA: The documentary strongly suggests the possibility that Manitowoc County sheriff's deputies planted evidence against Avery, including a key found in his bedroom and blood found in the victim's vehicle. But Sheriff Robert Hermann denied that Tuesday. "They did not plant evidence," Hermann said. "I trust them 100 percent. Quite frankly, I think justice was served in this case." He said he watched the series, and added: "I call it a film. It's missing a lot of important pieces of evidence."\nQ: WHY DO AUTHORITES SAY IT'S BIASED?\nA: The series spends much of its time detailing the perspective of Avery and Dassey family members. The case's special prosecutor, Ken Kratz, refused to comment to The Associated Press, but he has told other media outlets that the documentary ignores the majority of the physical evidence. The omissions include the fact that Avery's DNA was found on the hood latch on Halbach's SUV, which was hidden on the salvage lot. Kratz has also said a bullet fired from Avery's gun was found in his garage with Halbach's DNA on it.\nQ: WHAT DO THE FILMMAKERS SAY?\nA: Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos have stood by their work. They said in an email to the AP through Netflix representatives that critics who might say they intentionally omitted or underplayed key evidence to make the series more entertaining or tragic are wrong. "Those accusations are untrue and unfounded," the statement said.\nQ: THERE'S AN ONLINE PETITION SEEKING A PARDON ? COULD IT WORK?\nA: It seems unlikely for a lot of reasons. For one thing, the request posted on Change.org started by petitioning President Barack Obama, who has no such authority in this type of case, since it's not a federal matter. The petition, which recently was rewritten to include Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and remove the word "presidential" from the text of the appeal. Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick said Tuesday in an email to the AP that the governor hasn't watched the series and that "early in his administration, Gov. Walker made the decision not to issue pardons. Those who feel they have been wrongly convicted can seek to have their convictions overturned by a higher court."\nQ: WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIMS?\nA: Halbach's brother Mike Halbach has declined comment since releasing a statement from the family before the documentary became public. "Having just passed the 10-year anniversary of the death of our daughter and sister, Teresa, we are saddened to learn that individuals and corporations continue to create entertainment and to seek profit from our loss," the statement read. "We continue to hope that the story of Teresa's life brings goodness to the world."\nThe victim from the 1985 rape case has declined comment.\nQ: WHAT HAS THE REACTION BEEN LIKE?\nA: It's been all over the map. Celebrities have tweeted about how into the series they are, late night talk show host Seth Meyers spoofed it and fake Twitter accounts have been set up for some of the main players in the case. However, Sheriff Hermann said some of his officers have received threats in emails and voicemails. He said one was from a convicted felon who said an officer should "take his own life, or else he'd come up there and take it for him." Hermann said Tuesday that threat was passed along to Florida authorities to investigate.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Bill Cosby leaves the Cheltenham Township Police Department where he was processed after being arraigned on a felony charge of aggravated indecent assault in Elkins Park, Pa.?(The Associated Press)\nBill Cosby's attraction to Andrea Constand began the moment he spied her across a Temple University gym in about 2002. The flirting ? some would say grooming ? began almost immediately.\nWhen Constand, a Temple women's basketball staffer, mentioned that her back was bothering her, the 66-year-old comedian offered his "layman's" fix in the women's locker room.\nClick here to subscribe to FOX411â€™s?YouTube?channel\n"It's one where she gets on my back with her back and her arms come under mine and I grab her and I say, 'Now you relax,'" Cosby said in a 2005 deposition. "I go up and I come down and I give that jolt and it's supposed to line the vertebrae."\nThe friendship that followed between Temple's most famous booster and the then-31-year-old employee colors the sex-assault prosecution that starts in earnest Tuesday, when Cosby's lawyers will ask a judge to throw out charges stemming from a 2004 encounter at his suburban Philadelphia home.\nIn Cosby's mind, Constand had reacted "very, very favorably" to him the day they met at Temple's arena.\nA university trustee, he began inviting her to dinner at his home, at first with others but later alone. Cosby was both a sounding board and someone who could open doors for a woman considering a career change. In November 2003, he summoned Constand to the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut, where he was performing, and arranged for her to have dinner with a casino executive in his suite. But he voiced frustration when she failed to follow through on his job leads.\n"Here's a mentor, Bill Cosby, who is in the business ? Bill Cosby, who happens to know something about what to do ? and Andrea is not picking up on it," Cosby said in the deposition, part of the sex-assault lawsuit Constand filed in 2005.\nIn the deposition, Cosby paints himself as Constand's friend, mentor and occasional partner in sex "play" that stopped short of intercourse, lest she fall in love with him.\nConstand's lawyers have since pointed out that she is gay and was dating a woman at the time.\nBasketball, a common bond between them, had taken Constand from a standout high school career in Toronto to a 1996 NIT championship with the University of Arizona to semi-pro ball in Europe and finally a job with Temple women's basketball program.\nBy her third season, though, Constand was restless, wondering if this was the end of the road for her life in basketball. She spoke frequently about it to Cosby, during phone calls, at social events and during the approximately half-dozen visits she made to his Cheltenham home.\nCosby, in the deposition, described at least two separate nights when they engaged in sex play there ? the first time, after she had four drinks, and the second time, after he gave her unidentified pills. (Cosby said he never drank or did illegal drugs, although he acknowledged getting quaaludes in the 1970s to use on women he hoped to seduce.)\nThe criminal case involves the second night, in January 2004.\nCosby said: "Andrea came to the house. ... We talked about Temple University. We talked about her position. And then I went upstairs and I got three pills ... because she was talking about stress. ... We sat for 15 or 20 minutes talking. I then said, 'Let's go into the living room.' ... I asked her to have a sit down on the sofa. We were still talking. But then we began to neck and we began to touch and we began to feel and kiss and kiss back."\nCosby described the "digital penetration" that followed as something of a favor, to help her unwind.\n"I was hoping (it) had been a sort of a contribution to happiness, friendship, a moment that we shared," Cosby said.\nConstand later said she was too drugged to remember it clearly.\nCosby, in a taped phone call with Constand and her distraught mother a year later, confirmed that he gave her pills and described the sex act.\n"Tell your mother you were awake. Tell your mother about the orgasm. Tell your mother how we talked," Cosby begged on the phone call.\nOver the next few days, his agents and handlers made a flurry of calls to their family home to offer an educational fund or suggest they meet him at his next gig in Miami. The Constands instead gave the tape to police in Canada, who referred the case to Pennsylvania investigators.\nThen-Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce Castor declined to press charges in what he viewed as a "he said, she said" case.\nWhen a federal judge released portions of Cosby's civil deposition last year, prosecutors re-opened the case. District Attorney Kevin Steele weighed Cosby's testimony, and the dozens of similar accusations that have followed, and filed charges last month before the 12-year statute of limitations expired.\nDefense lawyers will argue Tuesday that Cosby had a deal that he would never be charged. In an unusual twist, Castor will be their key witness.\nThe AP generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they agree to have their names published, as Constand has done.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

It appears voters still going for Trump -- Trump getting 47 percent of the already voted crowd compared to Rubioâ€™s 22 percent.\nSo far, the only candidate whose' taken on Trump and continued to do well is Ted Cruz. On the other hand, maybe the smartest person of all has been John Kasich, who as he says is sometimes the only adult in the room. How many adults will we see tonight at the GOP debate?\n?\nGretchen Carlson currently serves as anchor of FOX News Channel's (FNC) "The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson" (weekdays 2-3PM/ET).

That was her 10-year long caring for the Ronald Reagan we didnâ€™t know, the Ronald Reagan whose authority and intellect diminished as his mind was destroyed by Alzheimerâ€™s. From all accounts she gave him the same love and attention she did before he came down with the disease. Maybe even more so.\nThe reason I especially appreciate her final devotion to her spouse is because I, like many other Americans, can identify with it. My parents are going through a similar experience. My mom has Alzheimerâ€™s or perhaps severe dementiaâ€¦you canâ€™t really be sure which it is until after death. The bottom line is, she rarely recognizes those around her, she hasnâ€™t been able to put a sentence together for more than 2 years, and about three months ago, she lost her ability to walk.\nBut what she hasnâ€™t lost is the love of the man she married 66 years agoâ€¦my dad. I really donâ€™t think the two of them have ever loved each other more than they do now.\nRelated Image\nExpand / Contract\nThe author's parents ((Courtesy of the author))\nFortunately theyâ€™ve been careful with their money and can afford a full-time helper to move my mother around and see to her basic needs. But my father is never far awayâ€¦eating with her, talking to her, or just silently holding her hand and kissing it.\nAs hard as it is to care for a beloved whoâ€™s struck by this, there is a joyfulness in my parentsâ€™ house. They have made the wonderful discovery that while brain power can disappear, the soul (and the love that comes out of it) is still visibleâ€¦in some ways more clearly than ever. My motherâ€™s sweet and loving spirit comes through in her smile, in her eyes, and in an occasional sentence jumble, which invariably has the word â€œloveâ€? in it. My father lives for those moments. I do, too.\nMy father is two years older than my mother, and he has a host of familiar ailments that come with age, including bad knees and kidneys. But his mind is good, and his caring for my mother these past several years has been the most heroic thing Iâ€™ve ever seen him do. I have a new-found respect for the man, as Iâ€™m sure the Reagan children developed for their mom. And to develop a renewed love and respect for your parents at the end of their life is a real blessing, and helps children fulfill their obligations with joy rather than out of a begrudging sense of duty.\nNancy Reagan Timeline | PrettyFamous\nOf course there are many frustrations that come with caring for a spouse hobbled by a lost mind. And Nancy Reagan was not hesitant about sharing details of that burden. But there is a beauty to behold between couples who have devoted their lives to each other. ..even when one of them gets sick. And the prolonged care that Nancy Reagan gave to her husband must have been beautiful to see. Of course I never saw them together in the final years. But as I see my folks this weekend, I will think of the Reaganâ€™s, and their deep love that, like my parentsâ€™ love, endured through a cloudy mind.\nGod bless Nancy Reagan. God bless Ronald Reagan. And God bless their eternal love.\nRest in peace.\nDavid Asman joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in 1997 and currently serves as host of "Forbes on FOX," a weekend half-hour program that offers an informative look at the business week (Saturday from 11:00-11:30 AM/ET).

Commentators have spent all kinds of ink and airtime trying to â€œblameâ€? the media, the culture, and the Republican Party itself for Trumpâ€™s dominance in the primaries so far.\nIn fact, Obama soon pivoted to faulting the GOP?which happens to be a prime Hillary talking point. And no, I am not shocked that he is trying to help his former secretary of State (who he pretty obviously favors over Bernie Sanders) in the race to succeed him.\nObama accused the Republican Party of â€œcreating an environment where somebody like a Donald Trump can thrive. Heâ€™s just doing more of what has been done for the last 7-1/2 years.â€? Then he zeroed in on immigration: â€œItâ€™s not as if thereâ€™s a massive difference between Mr. Trumpâ€™s position on immigration and Mr. Cruzâ€™s position on immigration.? Mr. Trump might just be more provocative in terms of how he says it, but the actual positions arenâ€™t that different.â€?\nIn other words, those Republicans, theyâ€™re all a little crazy. This, of course, ignores the fact that Cruz and Rubio are aggressively attacking Trump as unqualified for the presidency, and Trump is hitting them back even harder.\nAnd hey,when Obama spoke of a GOP â€œcrackupâ€? and â€œcircus,â€? some Republicans and conservative commentators have used similar language in ripping Trumpâ€™s impact on the party. Itâ€™s hardly amazing that a Democrat would pile on.\nBut Obama also wandered into familiar territory: blaming the conservative media.\nHe said he regrets the â€œpolarizationâ€? and â€œnasty toneâ€? of politics, and that he does â€œsoul-searchingâ€? about how he can better unify the country.?\nBut the president also said?â€œobjectivelyâ€?--that â€œthe Republican political elites and many of the information outlets -- social media, news outlets, talk radio, television stations -- have been feeding the Republican base for the last seven years a notion that everything I do is to be opposed; that cooperation or compromise somehow is a betrayal; that maximalist, absolutist positions on issues are politically advantageous; that there is a â€˜themâ€™ out there and an â€˜us,â€™ and â€˜themâ€™ are the folks who are causing whatever problems youâ€™re experiencing.â€?\nWell, some conservatives have worked hard to block Obama, and the Republican Congress hasnâ€™t been very cooperative, with the Senate even ruling out action on a Supreme Court nominee before the president has picked anyone. But that is a two-way street, and Obama and the Democrats have also failed to find common ground.\nBut on the business about TV and radio and social media outlets: The president of the United States has the biggest megaphone of all. He can drown out any talk show host, blogger or tweeter. He often seems to use media criticism as a crutch to explain away his shortcomings and setbacks.\nAnd now he has a new target in the Republican front-runner who wants his job.\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

A tent was erected over the site of the service.\nThe sprawling, Spanish Mission-style library is located between the Reagan's post-White House home in the upscale Bel Air section of Los Angeles and Rancho del Cielo, the "ranch in the sky" where the Reagans spent their leisure time, sometimes on horseback, in the rugged mountains near Santa Barbara.\nThe guest list for the funeral tells a story about their lives, which stretched from Hollywood's Golden Age to the California statehouse during Reagan's time as governor to the Washington Beltway. Four of the five living first ladies and relatives of every president dating to John Kennedy were expected to attend.\nIt will bring together Democrat and Republican, an unusual tableau at a time of deep division in Washington and the 2016 campaign trail. Hillary Clinton plans to take a break from the presidential campaign to attend, and other politicians on the list cover the political spectrum, from Newt Gingrich to Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Reagan's two children, Patti Davis and Ronald Prescott Reagan, will be among the speakers at the funeral, which will include choirs and a Marine Corps band.\nJames A. Baker, who served in the Reagan administration, and former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw also will give remarks during the private ceremony officiated by the Rev. Stuart Kenworthy, vicar of Washington National Cathedral.\nOn Wednesday and Thursday at the library, lines of mourners and Reagan faithful filed slowly past the former first lady's closed casket, blanketed with white roses and peonies, Mrs. Reagan's favorite flower.\nTears often fell. The crowd, many in graying years, spoke to an era closed, a time of "morning again in America" and the Reagan doctrine intended to weaken Soviet influence during the Cold War.\nReagan left the presidency after eight years, on January 20, 1989.\n"Ronald Reagan was one of the best presidents we've ever had, and I admired them both as a couple for their love story and the support they showed to each other," said retired school teacher Mary Ellen Gruendyke, from Riverside.\nMrs. Reagan, who died Sunday at 94, planned the smallest details of her funeral. She selected the funeral's flower arrangements, the music to be played by a Marine Corps band and the list of guests invited to the private memorial.\nThe library site, where the 40th president was buried in 2004, provides sweeping views of horse country dotted with oaks and, on a clear day, a vista to the Pacific.\nThe Reagans "just fell in love" with the spot, Boston developer and Republican fundraiser Gerald Blakeley recalled in a 2004 interview. He was part of a partnership that donated the land where the library now sits.\n"We're just grateful for the Reagan years," Ray Brooks of Simi Valley said Thursday as he waited in line with his wife Jackie to board a shuttle to the library grounds, where Mrs. Reagan's casket was placed in the marble lobby with a bronze statue of a smiling Ronald Reagan nearby.\n"Everybody, no matter how they felt about those years, when they look back they remember them as good years because of the example they set. We need an example like that now," Brooks said.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

Death to Americaâ€¦ and Snickers\nRIVALS GIVE TRUMP A PASS\nDonald Trump had his best debate so far, and he has Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio to thank for it.\nTrumpâ€™s campaign has been buffeted for weeks with unfavorable coverage about his business record , allegations of fraud , a lack of transparency and even claims of assault against a senior campaign staffer.\nGiven the tenor of the political discussion of late, one might have expected that the tone at Thursdayâ€™s CNN debate would have been an even more singeing version of what we heard a week prior in Detroit ? if only for the increase in combustible material.\nTrump must have been ready for the fight of his life against Cruz and Rubio, and clearly came to the stage with a more tentative air. As it turns out, he neednâ€™t have worried. Trump adopted a more presidential-sounding persona and did his best to revert to his early-debate strategy of staying out of the fray whenever possible and his rivals obliged him.\nIn a campaign that has become a referendum on Trumpâ€™s character, Cruz and Rubio didnâ€™t even raise the subject. And that was enough to put Trump in the driverâ€™s seat. Both raised issue-based critiques against Trump and tried to show him up on policy knowledge, but Trumpâ€™s supporters have never been demanding on that count.\nIn Rubioâ€™s case, it seems like he overlearned a lesson. The Florida senator was tut-tutted for making personal insults about Trump ? his spray tan, his small hands, etc. That, especially the joke about Trumpâ€™s junk, was too much.\nBut there is a difference between personal put downs and attacks on another candidateâ€™s character.\nTrump has managed to run a campaign intentionally short on policy details. He simply makes aspirational statements and then promises to â€œhire the best peopleâ€? or be a â€œgreat negotiatorâ€? to achieve the free border wall, Chinese capitulation on trade or even dealing with ISIS.\n(Trump seemed to stumble once in that regard Thursday when he backed the idea of 20,000 or 30,000 U.S. ground troops for the fight against ISIS.)\nThis election is not about issues. This election is about Trump. And certainly with only days to go before what may be the decisive batch of elections, itâ€™s certainly too late to try to put this contest on another path.\nTrumpâ€™s supporters want a charismatic, strong leader who will shake up the country. Who wouldnâ€™t? The question before the rest of the Republican Party is whether Trump is actually that person or if he is, as Rubio has previously charged, â€œa con man.â€?\nHis coloring and the size of his digits are not material to that discussion. But his record ? especially recent history like Trump University ? certainly is.\nThe absence of those attacks clearly surprised Trump who commented, â€œSo far, I cannot believe how civil itâ€™s been up here.â€? Thatâ€™s likely because Trump knew what he would have done as Cruz or Rubio: Go to your enemyâ€™s weakest spot and hit it mercilessly.\nTrump did it again and again throughout the cycle only to see his rivals start to learn the lesson. But on Thursday, they forgot what he had taught them.\nDispute deepens over Trump rally rough up - Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Ben Shapiro called on Trump to fire his campaign manager after Breitbart reporter and Fox News contributor, Michelle Fields, was reportedly assaulted at a Trump rally. Shapiro explained to Megyn Kelly on Thursdayâ€™s â€œThe Kelly File.â€?

LAT brings us the story: â€œVisitors to the valley called him the last of the mountain men, a local treasure. They admired his ability to live out his dream. After years of camping beneath these lofty trees with [Englishâ€™s son] Dennis and his wife Mary, he bid $11,000 for five acres here and won the deed. In the late 1970s, they proceeded to build a cabin that became a well-known waypoint for day-hikers and overnighters.

John Kasich in order to prevent Donald Trump from winning, according to published reports and comments from his own people.\n"If you want to stop Trump in Ohio, Kasich's the only guy who can beat him there," Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press.\nIn turn, Florida Sen. Rubio is hoping to win in his home state on Tuesday, thereby splitting the day's two big delegate prizes and keeping them out of Trump's hands.\nBut it doesnâ€™t look like Kasich is willing to play the same game. AP reporter Katie Ronayne Tweeted a quote from Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols saying in reference to the reported Rubio strategy, "We were going to win in OH without his help, just as he's going to lose in FL without ours"\nAccording to POLITICO , Rubio has denied any quid pro quo with Kasichâ€™s team. â€œI have not talked with John Kasich,â€? he said. He did seem to acknowledge to an MSNBC reporter on Friday, however, that Ohio may already be in the rear view mirror.\nâ€œThe reality at this stage is â€¦ we have a good team in Ohio, we will do as good as we can, but our focus is on Florida,â€? Rubio said.\nIn fact, the entire suggestion that the men could work together to thwart Trump seemed to have the opposite effect, with Kasichâ€™s people publicly relishing Rubio's seeming forfeiture of Ohio.\nâ€œWe welcome the support of the Rubio campaign,â€? Trent Duffy, another Kasich spokesman, told POLITICO, adding that any attempt to tell voters what to do was â€œpresumptuous.â€?\nâ€œThe voters should vote their conscience,â€? said Duffy. â€œThey should vote for the best person they think is best able to lead our country. We believe that man is John Kasichâ€¦everywhere across the country.â€?\nTed Cruz, who is running second in most polls, also scoffed at the alleged strategy. â€œItâ€™s real simple,â€? Cruz told reporters. â€œHow do you beat Donald Trump? You beat him.â€?\nPolls suggest that Kasich has a better chance in his home state than Rubio has in his. According to the RealClearPolitics poll average of the last 11 surveys in the state, Trump is besting the GOP field by 14.7 points in Florida. On the other hand, Trump is leading the pack by an average of only 2.5 percentage points in the last four Ohio polls.\nTrump continued to steal Rubioâ€™s hometown thunder Friday when he formally announced the endorsement of former presidential candidate -- and longtime Floridian -- Dr. Ben Carson.\nStanding at Trump's side in Palm Beach Friday morning, the retired neurosurgeon and conservative author gave Trump a hearty backing, and warned that a failure to rally behind him would "fracture the party in an irreparable way."\nRubio, who is coming in third in most polls, said it is Trump who could destroy the party, given the many Republicans who vow never to support him.\n"I certainly think it would fracture it," Rubio said of a Trump nomination on CBS' "This Morning.â€?\n"There is a very significant number of Republicans that will never vote for him. And you can't win unless the party's united," he said.\nRubio said Friday that in no way is he giving up."As far as Florida's concerned, we feel good, we're making progress, we have real momentum here now."\n?\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.

His endorsement appears to serve as a counterweight to Carly Fiorina coming out for Ted Cruz earlier this week.\nAt the Miami debate Thursday night, Trump?summed up the reality, though, that Florida Sen. Rubio and Ohio Gov. Kasich face.\nHe said only â€œtwo of usâ€? can get the delegates to win ? meaning Trump and Cruz ? and â€œtwo of usâ€? cannot, referring to Rubio and Kasich.\nâ€œThat is not meant to be a criticism â€¦ thatâ€™s just a mathematical fact,â€? Trump said, urging the party to â€œbe smart and unify.â€? ?\nRubio and Kasich are vowing to win their home states, which dish out all their delegates to the primary night winner.\nDonald Trump Endorsements | InsideGov\nBut even if they win, their paths to the nomination remain unclear ? and their best angle may still be to try and deny Trump the delegates needed to clinch the nomination going into the convention in July.\nBut Trump strongly suggested that as early as next week, the GOP contest could winnow down to a two-man race.\nThe states holding primaries Tuesday are Ohio, Florida, Missouri, Illinois and North Carolina.\nThe CNN-hosted debate Thursday saw Rubio change up his campaign approach once again ? dialing back the personal attacks on Trump, which didnâ€™t do much for his numbers in the most recent round of contests.\nInstead, Rubio hit Trump?on more substantive issues.\nOne of the most pointed debate?clashes came over the diplomatic thaw with Cuba ??a huge issue in Florida, host of the CNN debate and next weekâ€™s critical primary. Trump tangled with his rivals as he claimed heâ€™s â€œin the middleâ€? on the issue.\nTrump said â€œsomethingâ€? should take place after a decades-long freeze, but, â€œI want to get a much better deal.â€?\nâ€œHereâ€™s a good deal,â€? Rubio snapped back. â€œCuba has free elections. Cuba stops putting people in jail.â€?\nHe ? along with his rivals ? did their best Thursday to draw distinctions between them and Trump.\nOftentimes, Trump seemed to lean on his â€œart of the dealâ€? to explain his approach to global challenges. But it earned him criticism from the others on stage.\nCruz hammered Trump for suggesting heâ€™d be able to re-negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran.\nâ€œI will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal,â€? Cruz countered.\nTrump also took heat from Rubio and others as he defended his claim that â€œIslam hates us.â€?\nThe Republican front-runner said thereâ€™s â€œtremendous hatredâ€? in the Muslim world and called for new laws to confront the threat. ?\nâ€œWe better expand our laws or weâ€™re being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us,â€? Trump said.?\nBut Rubio and Cruz both said â€œof courseâ€? they would not want to allow the targeting of family members of terror targets, as Trump has called for. And they chided him for his remarks.?\nâ€œThe answer is not scream all Muslims bad,â€? Cruz said.?\nâ€œThe problem is presidents canâ€™t just say whatever they want,â€? Rubio said. â€œIâ€™m not interested in being politically correct. â€¦ Iâ€™m interested in being correct.â€??\nTrumpâ€™s rivals noted America must work with other Muslim nations to confront the ISIS threat.\nFor the most part,?Trump and his three Republican presidential rivals held their personal fire Thursday night during their last debate before next Tuesday's primary in Florida ? which votes alongside four other states.\nTrump even remarked on the subdued tone: â€œSo far I cannot believe how civil itâ€™s been up here.â€?\n"I think it was good that we had a substantive debate," Cruz told Fox News' Megyn Kelly. "The last two debates were pretty ridiculous [and] I was glad to see that nonsense ending."\nOhio Gov. Kasich also stressed at the debate that heâ€™s run an â€œunwavering positive campaignâ€? all along.\nBut on the domestic front, they did battle on the best way to save Social Security -- with Trump breaking from his competition by saying he'd leave it alone despite warnings it would start?running out of money in two decades.\nâ€œI will do everything in my power not to touch Social Security,â€? Trump said. He said heâ€™d instead get rid of waste, fraud and abuse ??including by ensuring the government bids out contracts.?\nRubio, though, said, â€œYouâ€™re still going to have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that youâ€™re going to have to make up.â€? He called for gradually raising the retirement age to 70.\nCruz echoed that call, saying the program is â€œcareening toward insolvency.â€?\nâ€œWe need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security,â€? he said.?\nKasich also called for changes, though not necessarily to the retirement age.\nAs Trump consolidates support and builds his delegate lead, though, he?kicked off the debate with a pointed message to the so-called â€œRepublican establishment,â€? effectively telling them to get on board with his campaign.\nHe started his opening statement by claiming his campaign is bringing in Democrats, independents and others in huge numbers to the polls.\nâ€œThe Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace whatâ€™s happening,â€? he said, addressing tension between his campaign and senior GOP leaders. â€œWe are going to beat the Democrats.â€?\n?\n	foxnews	U.S.

DeAratanha has been with the newspaper since 1989.\nThe attorney says the officers grew angry when DeAratanha suggested that his Brazilian ethnicity and tan skin was behind their questioning of him.\nLivingstone, the deputy chief, denied that race had anything to do with the encounter.\nâ€œThis is not something we want to happen,â€? Livingstone said. â€œHad he cooperated, we wouldâ€™ve had a different outcome.â€?\nDeAratanha was cited and released. He was treated at a local hospital for a sprained elbow.\nThe Ventura County district attorneyâ€™s office has 30 days to decide whether to press charges. The photographerâ€™s arraignment is scheduled for April 7, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement\n	foxnews	U.S.
