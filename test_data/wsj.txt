At least for now. But that isn’t stopping many migrants from trying to make their way across the border and beyond.\nThe End of the Road\nOn a recent cold and wet few days at the camp, migrants hang out in the bar for the warmth it provides and the food and friendship it offers.\nPeople talk over chips, pizza and beer, but mostly take solace in having a temporary escape from the misery of the camp. Out of their cold, muddy tents and playing games like checkers and backgammon, or connecting with distant relatives on their phones.\nGroups are usually separated by nationality, but talking about how to get out of Greece and farther into Europe is a topic everyone discusses.\nPakistani refugees warm themselves by a fire on the train tracks next to the bar.\nRefugees play cards at the bar.\nHatching a Plan\nOne morning, someone had a plan to cross a fast-flowing, ice-cold river to the border, despite the fence and increased police presence. It was a dangerous plan, but any escape would do.\nSomeone had a printout of a map showing the route across the river all the way to the border. People study it and take photos of it.\nZakaria, a migrant from Aleppo, Syria, says, “I want to continue my studies. I don’t care which country. It can be Germany or another country so long as I can continue my studies. I will wait here until I cross somehow. I would go back home to Syria if I could. Believe me I don’t want to be here, I want to be home, but I don’t even have a home there. No country and no home.”\nThe Escape\nBy noon that day, hundreds of people amassed at the meeting point on the map. Following the trail through forests and fields, this group of men and women, young and old carry their belongings and eventually come to the river.\nThe water is freezing. People are yelling and crying. Children are terrified. But they made it across. They were lucky. Earlier that morning, a separate group attempted to cross and three people reportedly died attempting the cross.\nAfter resting, they continue to the border, but are turned back by the Macedonian army.\nMigrants help a woman cross the river.\nPeople walk toward the border.\nStarting Over\nBack at the camp, they are exhausted and downtrodden, but they have the bar, and talk soon turns to finding another way to escape.\nSarwar, a migrant from Lahore, Pakistan, who has been in Idomeni for 16 days and just returned from trying to cross the border says, “They stop us today but we will try again. We are many, many people and more come now. Soon we can run through the fence. Today we had little people, but if we have all the people then we will succeed.”\nA Syrian mother washes her hands with her two daughters in the camp.\n| The Bar at the End of the Road\nBy\nMackenzie Knowles-Coursin for The Wall Street Journal\nMarch 25, 2016 1:34 p.m. ET\n	wsj	World

In an interview with CNN in January, Mr. Kim said he lived in Fairfax, Va., before moving in 2011 to Yangji, a city near the Chinese-North Korean border. He said he commuted daily to Rason, a special economic zone in North Korea, where he was president of a trade and hotel-services company.\nHe said in the Pyongyang news conference that he was detained in Rason in October.\nNorth Korean authorities often arrange news conferences for U.S. and other foreign detainees, in which they read statements to acknowledge their wrongdoing and praise the North’s political system.\nThose detainees have said after their releases that they were coached or coerced on what to say.\nSouth Korea’s National Intelligence Service, the country’s main spy agency, said Mr. Kim’s case wasn’t related to the organization in any way and offered no further comment.\nOutside analysts say North Korea often attempts to use foreign detainees to wrest outside concessions. North Korea in the past released some U.S. detainees after high-profile American figures visited the country.\n?Associated Press\nTAIWAN\nKuomintang Elects First Female Leader\nTaiwan’s China-friendly Nationalist Party has elected its first female leader after ousting her as its presidential candidate ahead of January elections that were won by pro-independence rivals.\nThe Kuomintang had ditched Hung Hsiu-chu as her abrasive style and strongly pro-China positions were seen as alienating voters. The veteran legislator and former teacher was elected as leader over three other candidates Saturday and likely faces a difficult time rebuilding the party after its January electoral defeat.\nMs. Hung takes over from Eric Chu, who was the party’s eventual presidential candidate and who resigned as party chairman after the defeat.\nChinese President Xi Jinping congratulated Ms. Hung from Beijing, saying he hoped the two parties would continue to oppose “Taiwan independence,” according to the official Xinhua News Agency.\nBeijing claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own, and relations between the two improved under the Nationalists, which governed Taiwan over the last eight years and promoted pro-China policies.\nThe independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party’s candidate, Tsai Ing-wen, won the presidential election, and her party also gained a decisive parliamentary majority.\nMs. Tsai, who will be inaugurated as president in May, has refused to meet Beijing’s demand that she endorse its claim that Taiwan and the mainland are part of a single Chinese nation.\n?Associated Press\n	wsj	U.S.

By sharing some of the more unusual insights about its audience, Spotify is hoping to attract a new wave of consumers to the Swedish music-streaming service.\n“There are people who have been on the sidelines of streaming and now they’re ready to come in and adopt streaming,” said Chief Marketing Officer Seth Farbman. “We wanted to give them a sense of what they’ve been missing out on.”\nPrivately-held Spotify, which has been valued by investors at $8.5 billion , has an audience that spans more than 75 million active users and 30 million paying subscribers. According to a legal filing last May , Spotify’s loss in 2014 widened to ?162 million ($181 million) from a year-earlier loss of ?55.9 million. Revenue in 2014 rose 45% to ?1.08 billion ($1.21 billion). The company shares a portion of its revenue with music-label partners.\nSpotify has an especially strong customer base among millennials, but is looking to court a broader and older demographic in its latest marketing efforts. Increasingly, Spotify has been focusing on attracting consumers in their late 30s and early 40s, Mr. Farbman said.\n“We fundamentally believe that the size of Spotify and the size of the audience is a real point of differentiation for us and we’ll continue to tell the stories that come from our music fans and tell the stories of how artists can find even more fans and accelerate their career,” Mr. Farbman said.\nIn the “Never Ending Story”-themed spot ? one of three commercials in Spotify’s campaign ? actor Noah Hathaway reprises his role as Atreyu from the film.\n“I can’t believe that after all these years people are still listening to the song,” a grown up Atreyu remarks as he rides on the back of the dragon Falcor, an iconic image from the film.\nWieden+Kennedy, the ad agency behind the campaign, looked for stories within Spotify’s treasure trove of data that “seemed too unbelievable to be true” that would give newbie users a reason to check out the platform, said creative director Brandon Henderson. Ultimately the stories it chose were ones “that mirrored topics that were relevant right now,” said creative director Erwin Federizo.\nA second spot in the campaign features a couple singing along to “My House” as they are driving their house across the border to Canada, a story line inspired by the surprising number of Spotify playlists dedicated to moving and also feature the Flo Rida song. Even Pope Francis has an artist page for a rock album on Spotify, an insight that led to a third commercial featuring nuns jamming out to a rock song in a church.\nThe new campaign marks a shift in how Spotify allocates its advertising and marketing budget. Prior to this campaign, Spotify hasn’t run TV ads in the U.S. since 2013 and has done limited out-of-home advertising. Mr. Farbman estimates that about two-thirds of the company’s ad spending in this campaign is on “above the line” media meant to boost brand awareness and reach new potential users. Previously, most of Spotify’s ad budget was spent on performance marketing and below-the-line media such as search that are meant to convert existing demand.\n“Mass mediums like television tell very good stories,” Mr. Farbman said. “Film is a very rich environment to share both the information and the emotion of when a fan and an artist connect. We’re using more traditional media channels to reach an audience we really hadn’t targeted as much.”\nAccording to data from ad tracking firm Kantar Media, Spotify spent $4.9 million on traditional media and display ads in the U.S. in 2014. Spotify said it is spending materially more on this campaign than it has in the past, but didn’t specify how much.\nIn addition to TV spots and out-of-home media, the campaign will also include social and interactive elements for consumers to share content. To give users a taste of Spotify’s offerings, the campaign’s online banner ads will be linked to curated playlists, such as a playlist of 80s movie soundtracks.\nIn mid-April, the company will launch a GIF generator that allows fans to put their image on Atreyu’s face so they appear to be riding the Falcor. The company will use the #GoFalcorYourself hashtag to users on its social channels and they’ll be directed to a microsite with the activation.\n“We don’t want to take ourselves too seriously,” Mr. Farbman said. “The work itself has to be joyful. It shouldn’t feel like advertising and if we stick to that formula I think we’re going to do pretty well.”\nWrite to Nathalie Tadena at nathalie.tadena@wsj.com\nSave Article\n	wsj	World

Mark Leno (D., San Francisco) said the proposal would go before the Legislature as part of his minimum-wage bill that stalled last year. The Los Angeles Times, which first reported the deal, said the wage would rise to $10.50 in 2017, with subsequent increases to take it to $15 by 2022. Businesses with fewer than 25 employees would have an extra year to comply.\nAt $10 an hour, California already has one of the highest minimum wages in the nation along with Massachusetts. Only Washington, D.C., at $10.50 an hour is higher. The rise to $15 would make it the highest statewide wage in the nation by far, though raises are in the works in other states.\n?Associated Press\nImmigration\nDemand for EB-5 Visas Surged in 2015\nA controversial federal immigration program offering green cards to some foreign investors had record demand in 2015, as concern that a key provision of the law might expire fueled a surge of aspiring immigrants.\nThe program, known as EB-5, received applications from 17,691 investors in 2015, up from 11,744 in 2014 and 6,554 in 2013, according to figures released last week by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nThere were 21,988 investor applications pending at year-end, and given that the program allows just 10,000 visas a year, that means a backlog of at least five years for most investors.\nWhile applications have consistently grown in recent years, demand was particularly strong at the end of 2015 because a key portion of the EB-5 program was expiring, and the inflow has slowed some since the law was extended in December for another 10 months.\nPart of the recent drop-off in demand may be linked to the slowing economy in China, which accounts for more than 80% of EB-5 visas issued. The program offers green cards to aspiring immigrants who invest at least $500,000 into certain businesses that have been determined to create at least 10 jobs per investor.\n?Eliot Brown\n	wsj	U.S.

Bernie Sanders would appear on the Democratic presidential primary ballot in June, the last presidential contest in the country, with 20 pledged delegates and 25 superdelegates at stake.\nThe unusual bill?which is expected to be signed by Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat?aims to neutralize a challenge to Mr. Sanders’s ballot eligibility enabled by an error by the District’s Democratic Party.\nMr. Sanders paid a fee to the city’s Democratic Party to appear on the primary ballot, but the party submitted the paperwork late to the city government’s Board of Elections.\nA local activist challenged Mr. Sanders’s place on the ballot for its June 14 primary.

Yet she got the better of him in the exchange over gun control, and he again failed to drive home his accusation that she is beholden to her top donors. Asked to name an instance in which she catered to the interests of her donors, he was not able to do so.\nNatalie Andrews\nApr 14, 2016 at 11:21 pm ET\nThe final share of conversation on Twitter was almost split for the two candidates, with Hillary Clinton getting 53% of the conversation on Twitter and Mr. Sanders at 47%.\nBut, Mr. Sanders's picked up more Twitter followers during the debate.\nThe top-tweeted moment during the debate was when Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders discussed the minimum wage.\nRebecca Ballhaus\nApr 14, 2016 at 11:18 pm ET\nTonight's discussion on Israel was one of the more interesting exchanges we heard tonight. Mr. Sanders's position?calling for the U.S. to be more "even-handed" in its approach to Israel and calling for treating the Palestinian people with "respect and dignity" in order to bring peace to the region?is an unusual one to hear in a Democratic primary, not to mention from a Jewish candidate.\nRebecca Ballhaus\nApr 14, 2016 at 11:15 pm ET\nThat may be it for Democratic debates. The party has said it would plan a debate in May, but none has been scheduled. And given the long clash between the two candidates on when and where to hold tonight's debate, they may be reluctant to hold a second round of negotiations.\nByron Tau\nApr 14, 2016 at 11:15 pm ET\nThe two candidates both have their passionate supporters, but the question is, did this debate change anyone's mind? It's unlikely that many Democrats walked away from this event with a changed perspective on either candidate.\nByron Tau\nApr 14, 2016 at 11:15 pm ET\nTonight's debate was sharper in tone that previous meetings, but policy-wise, both candidates were on well-trod ground. Neither delivered decisively blows and both largely repeated previous exchanges from earlier debates.\nDaniel Nasaw\nRead the rest of Amy's thoughts here on Washington Wire .\nMost Popular Videos\n	wsj	U.S.

423859	http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-10-point-1460973486	The 10-Point.	2016-04-18 00:00:00	Good morning,\nOil Slick\nOil prices slid earlier today after producers that supply nearly half of the world’s output ended their meeting in Doha over the weekend without reaching an agreement to cap production . Expectations for a deal among major producers, including several from OPEC and Russia, were a main driver in a rally over the past few weeks that had raised U.S. crude prices by more than 50% from their February lows. At the Qatar meeting, Saudi Arabia surprised the group by reasserting a demand that Iran also agree to cap its oil production. While oil markets could be disappointed by the failure to freeze output in the short term, with steep falls in crude prices also weighing on equity markets more generally, the longer-run impact could well be blunted by the reality that low prices are already pushing out many cash-strapped producers, making a formal freeze less important. Global stocks pared losses this morning after following the oil prices lower.\nDilma on the Brink\nIn a historic and emphatic repudiation of President Dilma Rousseff, Brazil’s lower house of congress voted yesterday to impeach the embattled leftist leader , whose popularity has plunged as the nation has sunk into recession and political paralysis. The country’s Chamber of Deputies reached the necessary threshold of 342 votes to move the impeachment proceedings to the Senate. The upper house will now decide in coming days whether she should stand trial for allegedly violating Brazil’s budget laws by disguising fiscal deficits. If a simple majority in the Senate now votes to proceed with a trial, Ms. Rousseff will be obliged to step aside for 180 days while the trial takes place. The odds of her succeeding in the Senate look bleak. We take a look at her career and legacy.\nAmerica’s Trumpiest County\nBuchanan County, Va., where Donald Trump won the highest percentage vote of any county so far, provides a clearer picture of why the GOP front-runner inspires supporters and poses problems for his rivals. We take a close look at the white, working-class enclave in Virginia’s southwest, gleaning important lessons for New York’s primary tomorrow. Meanwhile, both parties’ presidential front-runners are growing increasingly unpopular, our new poll finds, with Hillary Clinton showing an especially steep decline over the past month. And Republican voters overwhelmingly reject the idea of GOP convention delegates’ choosing a presidential nominee who hasn’t run in the 2016 primaries. Though the GOP presidential primary remains as unsettled as ever, Mr. Trump received a warm welcome in Staten Island yesterday, while Mrs. Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders sparred across the city.\nSensory Overload\nWearables are no longer in their infancy, writes our personal technology columnist Christopher Mims. Techies and manufacturers slap the label “wearable” on a broad swath of devices, doing a disservice to both users and the industry behind it. There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all wearable, and there may never be, as we use them to address a wide range of wants and desires, from controlling smart objects at a touch to monitoring stress. Some sensors don’t work well on the wrist, and, as they multiply, it will make sense to distribute them across our bodies. The idea that we should have, or even want, one wearable that does everything?like a feature-packed smartwatch?is probably wrong. Instead the future of wearables is likely more of them, everywhere.\nToday’s Video\n	wsj	U.S.

Analysts said prices got a boost from supply outages, including a strike by oil workers in Kuwait, which are expected to reduce production.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 49.44 points, or 0.3%, to 18053.60, a day after closing above 18000 for the first time since July.

The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of large U.S. commercial lenders is up 21% from a low hit in mid-February. The index still is down 6.4% this year, as banks have struggled with difficult trading conditions and low interest rates.\n“You’ve got to temper short-term enthusiasm with a reality check,” said Bill Nichols, head of U.S. equities at Cantor Fitzgerald.\nThe technology sector fell the most in the S&P 500, dropping 0.7%.

With Monday’s advance, the Dow is up 3.3% for the year.\n“You can’t underestimate people’s fear of missing out” in the stock market, said Steve Sosnick, an options trader at Timber Hill, the market-making division of Interactive Brokers. “The market came roaring back, and it’s one big momentum machine,” he added.\nEven as stocks have posted strong gains, the rally has slowed . Global growth remains sluggish, energy prices remain near depressed levels and company earnings aren’t particularly encouraging. The Dow industrials climbed roughly 12% from their Feb. 11 lows by mid-March. Since then, the blue-chip index has risen about 3%.\n“The more highs we get, the more antsy people are,” said Justin Wiggs, managing director in equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus.\nOn Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 107 points, or 0.6%, to 18004, closing above 18000 for the first time since July 20. The S&P 500 added 0.7% and the Nasdaq NDAQ 0.05 % Composite gained 0.4%.\nThe broad move higher in U.S. stocks?all of the S&P 500’s sectors rose ?marked a reversal from early losses. A tumble in oil prices sparked the initial losses after major oil-producing countries failed to reach an agreement to freeze output.\nThe turnaround “shows us the market is able to shrug off bad information more easily,” said Jonathan Corpina, senior managing director at Meridian Equity Partners.\nEnergy stocks rose the most in the S&P 500, gaining 1.6%. Consumer stocks rose after a batch of encouraging quarterly results.\nHasbro HAS -0.18 % shares jumped 5.8%, making it one of the biggest gainers in the S&P 500, as sales for the toy maker in the U.S. and Canada rose.\nMore\nStocks and Oil Prices: Correlation Breakdown\nWalt Disney DIS 1.14 % shares rose 2.9% after a new version of “The Jungle Book” opened this weekend and topped the box office with strong sales .

But the talks in Doha collapsed after Saudi Arabia reasserted a demand that Iran also agree to cap production.\n“It seems like oil-producing countries have a hard time coordinating on anything at the moment,” said Lars Tranberg, analyst at Danske Capital. “But I only see this as a major negative for stock markets if oil prices decline back to January levels,” he said.\nENLARGE\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

An oil worker strike in Kuwait also added support to prices as industrial action cut the country’s oil production in half.\nU.S. government bonds fell.

Asia’s fourth-largest economy has lost steam in recent months as sluggish exports weigh on growth, while domestic consumption remains weak, hurt in part by a graying population.\nGov. Lee Ju-yeol said the current rate of 1.5% is “accommodative enough” to support recovery, though it still has room to be lowered further.\nThe Bank of Korea cut its estimate for gross-domestic-product growth to 2.8% from 3%. Korea’s economy expanded 2.6% in 2015, slowing from 3.3% in 2014. The bank also expects consumer prices to rise 1.2% this year, down from a previous estimate for a 1.4% gain. Consumer inflation averaged 0.7% last year?the slowest pace ever reported.\n?Kwanwoo Jun\nARGENTINA\nAssociate of Kirchner Faces Federal Charges\nA federal judge in Argentina indicted a top government contractor and business associate of former President Cristina Kirchner on money-laundering charges.\nFederal Judge Sebastián Casanello indicted Lázaro Báez, his son, Martín, and four others in connection with an investigation into allegations that Mr. Báez plotted with federal officials to steal millions of dollars from the state by overbilling public-works projects granted by the government between 2003 and 2015.\nThis month, the judge had Mr. Báez and his accountant, Sebastian Perez Gadin, arrested in connection with the investigation. Judge Casanello ordered that the two remain in jail. Neither Mr. Baez nor Mr. Perez Gadin was reachable to comment. Mr. Báez has denied the allegations.\nThe judge also ordered the arrest of a lawyer with close ties to the two.

Shares of commodity-sensitive firms have been some of the biggest winners in this period, helping push major U.S. indexes back near all-time highs.\nSome investors say they are encouraged by the broad gains in U.S. stocks . More stocks have participated in the rally than just a few big gainers, and shares of both large and small companies have advanced.\nCFPB Sheds Light on Coming Payday-Loans Rule\n“The market is in a stronger position today as we approach all-time highs than it was a year ago,” said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, which manages $6.5 billion in assets.\nExpectations for swings have diminished as U.S. stocks have clambered back near records. The CBOE Volatility Index, which is based on prices of S&P 500 options that investors tend to rush to when they are fearful of stock declines, hit a fresh intraday low for the year, touching 12.50. The index ended 0.3% higher at 13.28, its third-lowest close this year.\nU.S. government bonds fell, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield to 1.852%, from 1.783% Tuesday, for the largest one-day yield gain since March 1.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 42.67 points, or 0.2%, to 18096.27. The blue-chip index rose as much as 114 points during the session.\nUnitedHealth Group UNH 2.63 % shares rose $3.43, or 2.6%, to $133.93, contributing 23 points to the Dow’s advance. The company raised its 2016 earnings guidance and on Tuesday said it would pull out of nearly all of the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges.\nThe S&P 500 edged up 1.60, or 0.1%, to 2102.40, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 7.80, or 0.2%, to 4948.13.\nENLARGE\nEnergy stocks notched the second-biggest advance in the S&P 500, turning higher along with U.S. oil prices. Photo: Bloomberg News\nFinancial shares led the S&P 500 higher, while utilities posted the biggest declines. That is a reversal of what has happened so far this year, with financial stocks slipping 1.3% year to date and utilities gaining nearly 11%.\nEnergy stocks notched the second-biggest advance in the S&P 500, rising 0.8%. Those shares turned higher along with oil prices after an unexpected and sharp drop in U.S. distillate stockpiles . U.S. crude oil rose 3.8% to $42.63 a barrel.\n“There’s a sense of confidence that oil has established a new trading range,” said Giles Fitzpatrick, partner at London’s Hannam & Partners.\nIn other corporate news, MGM Growth Properties MGP 4.81 % rose 1.01, or 4.8%, to 22.01 in its stock-market debut after the offering priced at $21 a share .\nSPX?Leaders and Laggards?-?1 Day\nCoca-Cola KO -4.79 % fell 2.23, or 4.8%, to 44.37 after it said revenue and profit declined in its latest quarter.\nInvestors also were looking ahead to the European Central Bank’s April meeting on Thursday . While few expect policy makers to announce new moves after the central bank’s comprehensive easing package last month , European Central Bank President Mario Draghi could comment on future interest-rate cuts and the recent strength of the euro.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.4%. The euro fell 0.5% against the dollar to $1.1298.\n“There is some risk that at the press conference tomorrow following the ECB meeting, Draghi may be more forceful in resisting premature tightening,” said Marc Chandler, head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.\nThe moves also followed a rocky session in Shanghai , which left some investors nervous that a recent rally in Chinese stocks may have run its course. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.3%, its biggest drop since Feb. 29.\n	wsj	World

Photo: Harry How/Getty Images\nBy\n1 COMMENTS\nLouis Oosthuizen of South Africa announced Thursday that he would not participate in golf’s return to the Olympics in August, becoming the second top-15 player to withdraw this week.\nThe 12th-ranked Oosthuizen, who won the 2010 British Open, joined 7th-ranked Adam Scott of Australia in skipping the tournament. Both players cited busy schedules. Former world No. 1 Vijay Singh of Fiji also said last week that he will not play in the Rio de Janeiro Games. In a Golf Channel interview, Singh cited “the Zika virus, you know, and all that crap.”\nThe withdrawals again raise the question of just how interested top players will be in golf’s return to the Olympics for the first time since 1904. Eligibility for the 60-player field will be based on the world rankings, with the top 15 getting in, at a limit of four per country. But eligibility doesn’t guarantee participation.\nTy Votaw, vice president of the International Golf Federation, said he couldn’t guarantee that more players won’t withdraw. But he cited the interest previously expressed by top players such as Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Jason Day and Rory McIlroy. “They’ve all expressed enthusiasm for it, and have all committed to being there,” Votaw said.\nManfred: Unwritten Rules Left to Players\nWith a cultural divide raging in Major League Baseball over what kind of celebrations are appropriate, league commissioner Rob Manfred said it’s up to players to make their own unwritten rules. The divide has been an ongoing source of tension between American-born players and players from Latin American countries, but Manfred said he believes players will sort it out.\n“The various groups that participate on the field are going to have to work through a middle ground,” Manfred said during a meeting with the Associated Press Sports Editors. “I do believe our players understand diversity and that even though there may be differences along these lines, they will find a way to a middle ground that’s acceptable to the vast majority of those players.”\n3\n	wsj	World

Photo: Reuters\nBy\n5 COMMENTS\nNEW DELHI?India and three other South Asian nations said they would boycott a regional summit in Pakistan after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for a terrorist attack on a military base that killed 18 soldiers.\nTensions between India and Pakistan, who have fought four wars since independence from Britain in 1947, are flaring amid an escalating war of words.\nAfter militants stormed an Indian army base in the disputed territory of Kashmir earlier this month, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the assailants had come from Pakistan and pledged that “those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished.” Pakistani officials have denied involvement and warned India against any hostile action.\nMore in Asia\nRodrigo Duterte Condemned After Comparing Philippine War on Drugs With Holocaust Sept. 30, 2016\nIndia’s Foreign Ministry said the country wouldn’t participate in a November meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation because of “increasing cross-border terrorist attacks” and Pakistan’s “growing interference” in the internal affairs of other countries.\nPakistan said New Delhi’s decision was “unfortunate.” It accused India in turn of meddling in its domestic matters.\nAfghanistan, which also accuses Islamabad of harboring terrorists that attack it, said it too was withdrawing from the summit. Bangladesh and Bhutan also pulled out. Sri Lanka said it wasn’t inclined to participate if other countries wouldn’t attend, but hadn’t reached a decision.\nThe only other members of the group are Nepal and the Maldives. It was unclear whether the summit would be canceled or relocated.\nUnrest in the part of Kashmir that India governs has contributed to the deteriorating relations between New Delhi and Islamabad. Both control parts of Kashmir but claim the region in full.\nSince Indian security forces killed a popular separatist militant this summer, there have been widespread clashes between demonstrators and police that have left dozens of people dead and thousands injured. India has accused Pakistan of fomenting the strife.\nIn a speech at the United Nations General Assembly this week, Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said Pakistan “should have no place in the comity of nations” because “to shelter terrorists has become their calling card.”\nPakistan denies supporting terrorists and has decried India’s use of force in Kashmir. At the U.N., Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said there could be no peace between the countries until the Kashmir dispute is resolved.\nIndia’s army says the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad was behind the recent attack. In an undated post on the website of its magazine, the group denied carrying out the attack but indicated its support for the assailants.\n“We don’t know which blessed people” carried out the attack, the post said, adding: “The call to jihad is echoing far and wide.”\nIndia also blamed Jaish for an attack on an Indian air force base in January in which seven security personnel were killed. That attack halted efforts to restart peace talks between India and Pakistan.\nPakistani authorities say there are no havens for terrorists in the eastern province where the group has its headquarters. But a visit by The Wall Street Journal this year showed it continued to operate freely from its base there .\nFacing pressure in India to respond, Mr. Modi is examining a number of levers, from water to trade. His government is examining its options over a treaty that governs the use of the Indus River and its tributaries, a lifeline for Pakistan’s economy. India wants to increase dam-building on its side, something that could affect the flow of water to lower riparian Pakistan.\nPakistan said Tuesday that if India revoked the pact, it “can be taken as an act of war.” Prime Minister Sharif’s top foreign-policy adviser, Sartaj Aziz, said any Indian violation of the treaty would give its ally China justification to restrict the flow of water in the Brahmaputra River, which originates in China and is critical to India’s northeast.\n?Qasim Nauman in Islamabad, Pakistan, contributed to this article.\nWrite to Niharika Mandhana at niharika.mandhana@wsj.com\nSave Article\n	wsj	World

963751	http://www.wsj.com/articles/cmo-today-trump-video-fuels-feisty-presidential-debate-1476102161	CMO Today: Trump Video Fuels Feisty Presidential Debate	2016-10-11 00:00:00	0 COMMENTS\nMARTHA AND ANDERSON: Moderating any presidential debate is challenging. But last night ABC’s Martha Raddatz and CNN’s Anderson Cooper had to figure out how to guide a town hall on “the issues” when there was one topic dominating the airwaves for the preceding 48 hours: the lewd remarks Donald Trump made about women on an “Access Hollywood” tape in 2005. Mr. Cooper went there early on, asking Mr. Trump if he understood that he was boasting about sexual assault (the GOP candidate said it was “locker room” talk and apologized). The moderators cracked the whip , cutting off both candidates to keep things moving, and Ms. Raddatz had some tense exchanges with Mr. Trump on foreign policy, Politico reports. Mr. Trump complained about his perception that he was being challenged and interrupted more, at one point lamenting it was “one on three.” Some critics wanted more questions from the audience, accusing the moderators of overstepping, Fortune and CNBC report. With all eyes on Mr. Trump just days after the video surfaced, the event could be another ratings bonanza for the networks. We’ll see if NBC’s Sunday Night Football took a hit or if the Packers and Giants ate into the debate audience. (NBC was telling viewers to watch the game and stream the debate.)\nBILLY BUSHWHACKED: While Donald Trump’s comments on that “Access Hollywood” tape have threatened to upend his campaign, there was another voice on the recording, NBC’s Billy Bush, and that has sparked a separate controversy for the network. At the time of the conversation, Mr. Bush was a co-host of “Access Hollywood” and he is heard egging on Mr. Trump during a lewd exchange. After initially signaling Mr. Bush’s job was safe, NBC decided to suspend him from his role on the “Today Show,” The Wall Street Journal reports. (Mr. Bush has apologized for his conduct.) NBC also faced questions about why The Washington Post broke the story of the tape on Friday when NBC and Access Hollywood had possession of it for several days last week. An NBC executive told WSJ the delay was caused by lawyers determining if Access Hollywood could be accused of recording it illegally (they decided there was no issue). Pressure is now also mounting for “The Apprentice” producer Mark Burnett to release footage in which Mr. Trump reportedly used sexist language while filming the reality show, the Associated Press reported. Mr. Burnett is backing Mr. Trump and has warned staffers not to leak the footage , according to BuzzFeed News.\nDAMAGE CONTROL: The NFL is rushing to assure its teams that people still love to watch football following news that ratings were down more than 10% a month into the season. “While our partners, like us, would have liked to see higher ratings, they remain confident in the NFL and unconcerned about a long-term issue,” wrote NFL senior executives Brian Rolapp and Howard Katz in a letter to the teams. They added that over the past 15 years, ratings viewership has grown 27% and that football “continues to be far and away the most powerful programming on television and the best place for brands and advertisers.” Of all the theories of what’s the drag on viewership -- the election, cord-cutting, anthem protests, -- you can be certain Twitter isn’t the culprit. Sponsors have been underwhelmed by Twitter’s live-streaming of Thursday Night Football, Ad Age reports. The second game delivered 327,000 average-per-minute viewers -- a metric in line with how TV is typically measured.\nTHE GREAT WALL: After Netflix launched in 130 countries this year, the question for many investors was how soon the company would gain entry to the giant untapped market that’s proved elusive: China. In the words of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who spoke at the New Yorker TechFest, it “doesn’t look good,” Bloomberg reports. He referenced movie services from both Disney and Apple that were shut down in recent months. Mr. Hastings had no comment on speculation of Disney’s M&A interest in Netflix , Recode reports, but he had some colorful commentary on the film industry, accusing theater owners of “strangling the movie business” by holding firm against allowing films to stream soon after they’re released in theaters, according to Variety. Recall that theater owners were annoyed by Netflix’s deal with luxury theater group iPic Entertainment that allows films to be streamed upon theatrical release.\nElsewhere\nBankers and lawyers are beginning to line up for a potential Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp. deal. The special committee of the board of Viacom has hired Morgan Stanley, while CBS’s special committee has retained Lazard. [ CMO Today ]\nTo mark Fox News’s 20th Anniversary, co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy held a meeting to announce plans for the business, including the unveiling of a fancy new $30 million studio. The celebrations come in the wake of the sexual harassment scandal that led to Roger Ailes’s ouster.

Photo: Bloomberg News\nBy\n3 COMMENTS\nBERLIN?The eurozone is in bad need of repair and stabilizing its foundations is only possible by following previously established fiscal rules, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch?uble said Friday.\n“We have already done a lot to stabilize the euro. Now we have to continue our work to minimize risks in the banking sector and push on with the capital market’s union. But above all we have to ensure that we stick to the fiscal rules we have agreed to together. The rules are there to ensure stability in the euro area,” he said at a speech in Bratislava, Slovakia on “Shaping the Future of Europe.”\n“Don’t forget that most economists have said a currency union without a common fiscal policy will never work. We have no common fiscal policy and until we have, we have to stick to some rules.”\nHis passionate call comes as Berlin has become frustrated with recent leeway given by the European Commission toward countries such as Portugal and Spain, which are struggling to meet budget rules as set under the European Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission argues any fine would weaken these countries even more.\nThe rule requires countries to keep their budget deficit under 3% of gross domestic product and their debt level below 60% of GDP.\n“We can clearly see that those who implement the rules are those doing best. Normally implementation is the job of the European Commission. The current Commission has chosen to be more political and it has every right to do so. I am in favor of a political leadership by the European Commission,” Mr. Sch?uble said.\n“But this makes it more difficult to impose compliance. That’s clear. We should therefore start thinking about how we can ensure that the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact are actually enforced. Perhaps the European Stability Mechanism could play a role in budget compliance in those cases where the Commission can’t.”\nMr. Sch?uble believes that a eurozone bailout fund, which assumes a watchdog role over countries’ budgets, will boost confidence in the euro.\n“Our European house is currently in bad need of repair. We need to become more economically competitive and to get our institutions functioning correctly again,” he said. “Borrowing and throwing money at our problems will not solve them. We need to make our foundations more stable and we need to do this now.”\nWrite to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.com\nSave Article\n	wsj	World

Photo: Reuters\nBy\n11 COMMENTS\nLONDON?The U.K. economy delivered a twin boost for Prime Minister Theresa May’s government on Thursday, as Nissan Motor Co. confirmed a major investment in England’s northeast and post-Brexit-vote growth figures came in better than expected.\nThe government trumpeted the news as a sign the country is absorbing the reverberations of the nation’s historic decision to depart the European Union, but economists cautioned that the greater test still lies ahead, as Mrs. May has yet to formally begin disentangling the U.K. from the 28-member club.\nIn the most comprehensive picture since the June referendum, the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics said the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 2% in the three months immediately following June’s vote, slower than the 2.7% annualized pace clocked up in the second quarter. But that was better than many were expecting and far better than many economists had predicted if the U.K. voted to leave.\nENLARGE\nSeparately, Nissan said it would press ahead with the manufacture of its Qashqai sport-utility vehicle and a second model in Sunderland, England, a move widely seen as a vote of confidence in the U.K. despite jitters over its future.\nThe move preserves some 7,000 jobs at the auto maker and its suppliers in a city that voted to sever the U.K.’s EU ties. Mrs. May hailed the news as “fantastic.”\n“Today’s data show that the economy is resilient,” Treasury chief Philip Hammond said in a statement. “The economy will need to adjust to a new relationship with the EU, but we are well-placed to deal with the challenges and take advantage of opportunities ahead.”\nPost-vote uncertainty has sent the pound plummeting and raised fears that companies will stop investing or could shift their operations to continental Europe if Britain doesn’t strike a favorable deal on its future ties to the bloc. The news gives the government some breathing room as it maps out its exit strategy, attempting to balance public demands for immigration controls against the desire of banks and manufacturers for unfettered access to the bloc’s tariff-free single market.\nRelated Reading\nU.K. Jobless Rate Holds Steady\nIt also provides ammunition to those who dismissed as alarmist the warnings issued by officials and analysts ahead of the referendum. “Contrary to what the doom-mongers are saying, there are plenty of good business opportunities out there and Brexit holds no fear for many in the U.K.,” said John Baron, a Conservative lawmaker who supported Britain’s exit from the EU.\nThe U.K. Treasury, for example, forecast a small contraction in the third quarter if the U.K. voted to leave the bloc in an analysis published in May. But it said Thursday those predictions didn’t account for an August stimulus push by the Bank of England and other growth-friendly developments since the referendum.\nThe economy’s apparent strength also casts doubt on the prospect of further stimulus in the coming weeks. The BOE telegraphed when it cut its benchmark interest rate in August that it expected to cut it again before the end of the year if the economy panned out as it expected.\nEconomists said Thursday that now seems unlikely. They added that a big fiscal splurge by Mr. Hammond, who is due to set out a post-vote set of tax and spending plans Nov. 23, also seems remote, although he has signaled he may modestly increase investment in infrastructure while keeping a tight rein on day-to-day spending.\nVIEW Interactive\nThe U.K. statistics agency said Thursday that growth in the third quarter was driven by services, which accounts for some 80% of the economy. Services’ strength offset contractions in industrial production and construction, data showed. The ONS’s preliminary estimate of gross domestic product is based on less than half the data included in its third and final report, and is frequently revised.\nEconomists say the economy’s resilience may not last. Among the concerns: That a sharp slide in the pound drives up inflation, squeezing consumer spending, and that uncertainty over the U.K.’s future ties to the EU depresses business investment.\n“We expect the economy to slow over the coming year,” said Simon Kirby, head of macroeconomic forecasting and modeling at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, a nonpartisan think tank in London.\nSome surveys of business chiefs have pointed to a weakening of investment intentions, but hard data on economywide investment won’t be published until next month. Gavin Patterson, chief executive of telecommunications firm BT Group PLC, warned Thursday that uncertainty resulting from the vote will likely jeopardize corporate spending, while banking lobbyists have signaled that financial firms may shift some staff and activities outside of London, Europe’s financial hub, if access to the single market is curtailed.\nNissan’s investment came after Mrs. May’s government gave “commitments” to ensure the Sunderland factory, which churns out 500,000 vehicles a year, will remain competitive after Brexit, according to the company, although it said it wasn’t getting any special treatment.\nAndrew Churchill, managing director of JJ Churchill Ltd., a Market Bosworth, England-based company that manufactures blades and other high-precision components for the aerospace industry, said he doesn’t intend to pull back on investing and hiring despite the uncertainty clouding the outlook.\nMrs. May has said she intends to serve formal notice of EU withdrawal by March, a move that will start the clock ticking on at least two years of unprecedented exit talks.\n“There are many unknowns, but they are not unknowns I can do anything about,” Mr. Churchill said. “Whatever the outcome of those negotiations, we have to continue to improve.”\n?Eric Sylvers in Milan, and Simon Zekaria and Jenny Gross in London contributed to this article.\nWrite to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com\n	wsj	World

Photo: Jay LaPrete/AFP/Getty Images\nBy\n130 COMMENTS\nDonald Trump , seeking to boost momentum in the last days of the presidential election, wired $10 million of his own money into his presidential campaign Friday?morning, two advisers said.\nThe cash infusion will be used to buy $25 million in new TV advertising in key battleground states, the advisers said. With some polls tightening in recent days, the Republican nominee is determined to pull out a win 11 days from now, one aide said.\nMr. Trump’s cash infusion brings his total contributions to his campaign to $66 million. That includes about $30,000 he gave earlier this month in in-kind contributions, according to a report the campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission?on Thursday.\nMr. Trump’s latest donation to his cause still falls $34 million short of the $100 million he has repeatedly said he will give to his campaign?a pledge he reiterated as recently as Wednesday.\nMore on Election 2016\nLegal Skirmishes Erupt Over Voting Rules\nThe move comes at a critical juncture for Mr. Trump, as he entered the final weeks of the election with about one-fourth as much cash in his campaign coffers as Democratic rival Hillary Clinton . Mrs. Clinton had more than $62 million in the bank as of Oct. 19, compared with Mr. Trump’s $16 million, according to new FEC disclosures .\nIn addition to Mr. Trump’s personal money, the campaign is receiving strong contributions from small donors, according to one adviser. Since the second presidential debate, online fundraising has grown significantly, hitting $4.6 million Thursday alone, he said.\nThe new commercials will attack Mrs. Clinton as an insider, alleging that the Clinton family improperly used its government and foundation ties for personal gain, and contrast her with Mr. Trump as being an agent of change, one adviser said. They will air in the key states of Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Virginia, he said. The campaign may surprise observers with ads in other states, too, he added.\nWho Will Swing the Swing States?\nThe decision to put more money into TV ad buys follows the Trump campaign’s internal polling, which showed the success of its latest ads attacking Mrs. Clinton.\nFor the final two weeks of the campaign, Mrs. Clinton had about $48 million of TV advertising booked, while Mr. Trump’s campaign has reserved $36 million, according to a media buyer. Mr. Trump’s ad rate is likely to be higher because he is buying late in the election when competition for ad space is at its peak.\nMr. Trump’s donation on Friday followed a series of emails he has sent to supporters in recent weeks pledging to match their donations. In one such email, from Oct. 1, he pledged to “triple match” donations above $75, writing, “Because this is so important, I am going to extend our triple-match opportunity for the next 24 hours.”\nMrs. Clinton’s cash advantage means she could spend on average $7.6 million per day between Oct. 20 and Election Day. Mr. Trump’s average daily allowance, prior to his latest donation: $3.3 million per day.\nRelated Video\nDonald Trump wired $10 million of his own money to his presidential campaign in an effort to gain ground on opponent Hillary Clinton, whose campaign has four times as much cash as Trump. Rebecca Ballhaus analyzes the numbers on Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero. Photo: AP\nThis week, Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump’s national finance chairman, said the campaign had slowed its high-dollar fundraising operation, run through Trump Victory, his joint fundraising vehicle with the Republican Party that can accept checks of up to $450,000 per person.\nThe GOP nominee instead will focus mostly on rallies and other campaign events, while a few more fundraisers are planned featuring surrogates, and the campaign will continue to do “informal fundraising,” Mr. Mnuchin said.\nMrs. Clinton also plans to stop attending fundraisers, but has about 40 events lined up featuring her surrogates.\nAfter largely self-funding his primary campaign, Mr. Trump considerably reduced his monthly donations starting in May, when he began actively soliciting outside funds.\nHe has given about $2 million each month since then, except for June, when he gave close to $4 million. FEC records show his donations?not including Friday’s $10 million?account for about a fifth of all the funds he raised through Oct. 19.\nWrite to Monica Langley at monica.langley@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com\nSave Article\n	wsj	World
1022869	http://www.wsj.com/articles/early-voting-bolsters-hillary-clinton-in-key-states-1477675294	Early Voting Bolsters Hillary Clinton in Key States	2016-10-28 00:00:00	Early Voting Bolsters Hillary Clinton in Key States\nDemocrat sees enthusiasm in Florida and Nevada, while Donald Trump holds his own in Ohio\nENLARGE\nVoters cast their ballots early this week in Miami. Photo: Giorgio Viera/Zuma Press\nBy\n32 COMMENTS\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton appears to have a slight edge over Republican rival Donald Trump in a number of battleground states and among important demographic groups based on an analysis of the millions of votes already cast both at polling places and by absentee ballot.\nMrs. Clinton is seeing positive signs of enthusiasm in such states as Florida and Nevada. She is also seeing strong turnout rates in the early vote from Latinos and women.\nBut Mr. Trump may have an advantage in the midwestern battlegrounds of Ohio and Iowa, where Democratic voter interest appears to be flagging compared with the 2012 presidential, records show.\nAccording to data compiled by the United States Elections Project and the Associated Press, at least 17 million votes had already been cast as of?Friday. Early voting is under way in a number of top-tier battlegrounds including Florida, Nevada, Iowa and North Carolina. Absentee voting has been happening in some form in every state, thanks to laws that require military and overseas ballots to be ready by September.\n“Clinton has opened up a national lead in the polling, and there are some states that have been following that lead in the state polling,” said Michael McDonald, who runs the United States Elections Project and is one of the foremost experts on early voting. “We can also see similar patterns of movement in the early vote as well.”\nBallots are secret, but many states release the partisan registration of the voters requesting and returning absentee ballots or voting in-person. While those numbers don’t take into account voters who cross over and vote for a candidate of the other party, the early numbers can provide clues into voter enthusiasm and the potential makeup of the electorate.\nRelated Coverage\nFlorida Once Again a Focus in 2016 Campaign\nIn Florida, Republicans typically have an advantage in early and absentee voting numbers, but this year, the parties are in a virtual dead heat in ballot returns and votes cast. Democrats also cite an increase in female and Latino participation in early voting, with the Clinton campaign using state data to note that 133,000 Latino voters have returned ballots?a 99% increase from this point in 2012. Republicans note that the early-voting sites in some GOP-leaning counties aren’t yet open.\nIn Nevada, the first week of early and absentee voting showed Democrats ahead by about 25,000 votes on the strength of returns in Clark County, the state’s population center that includes Las Vegas. Democrats attribute their strength among the state’s Latino voters for the increase. Republicans are running in closer in Washoe County, home to Reno. The GOP is also ahead in absentee ballots statewide.\nIn North Carolina , the number of early voting sites in the state has been reduced since the last election, but participation is about on par with this point in 2012. As of Friday, Democrats led in early voting and absentee-ballot returns in North Carolina by more than 100,000 votes.\nDespite a strong early performance in 2012, President Barack Obama lost North Carolina that year, and Mrs. Clinton will need big turnout from black voters, who are down as a share of voters in early returns, according to state data.\nDraw the 2016 Electoral College Map\nOnly a handful of states release data about the gender of early voters, but the figures that are available shows female ballot returns are outpacing male ones, according to numbers compiled by the United States Elections Project. Mrs. Clinton has built her polling lead on her strength with women.\nRepublican operatives say they aren’t alarmed by early voting trends in the battleground states, with one Republican National Committee official saying the states the party hopes to win are still within reach.\nIn Iowa and Ohio, early voting points to lackluster Democratic interest rather than a groundswell of Republican enthusiasm. Key counties around Cleveland and Columbus show lower levels of Democratic early voting, Mr. McDonald said.\nThe story is similar in Iowa, where Republicans are flat in terms of ballots requested, at about 175,000, and the 116,000 ballots that have been already cast is down about 11,000 from four years ago.

Photo: Getty Images\n“For us, it doesn’t really make a difference but of course we can’t not welcome words, thoughts, intentions that are publicly expressed about normalizing relations between the U.S. and Russia,” he said.\nThe Kremlin has long been critical of the democratization agenda pursued overseas by the U.S. and supported actively by Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Putin has often accused Washington of using democracy promotion as a front for regime change, with the U.S. both openly and covertly funding groups supporting democracy in Russia.\nHe dismissed the idea that Moscow could have some impact on the U.S. elections.\n“Does anybody seriously think that Russia could somehow influence the choice of the American people?” he said. “Is it a banana republic or something? America is a great power.”\nEarlier this month, U.S. intelligence agencies directly accused the Russian government of trying to interfere in the elections by leaking emails from the Democratic National Committee and other entities.\nMr. Putin criticized the U.S. election campaign, saying that political issues had been “watered down.”\n“Elections have stopped being an instrument of change, and have been reduced to scandals, to mudslinging, to questions of who pinched whom and who is sleeping with whom,” he said.\nThe Russian leader also criticized the West for propagating what he called the “fictional, mythical” military threat Moscow poses to the rest of the world.\n“It’s truly a profitable activity. This way they can push through new military budgets in their countries, they can bend allies to the interests of one superpower, they can expand NATO and move its infrastructure, troops, and equipment closer to our borders,” he said.\nTies between Russia and the West were frayed by the Ukrainian conflict of 2014, and relations have soured further in recent months as a cease-fire in Syria, brokered by Russia and the U.S., broke down almost immediately. The U.S. said earlier this month it was suspending talks with Russia because of its role in Aleppo, where Russia has been accused of helping Syria in the aerial bombardment of the city.\nRelations with Europe have withered , too. Mr. Putin canceled a trip to Paris after calls by the French foreign minister to investigate Moscow for war crimes for its role in the Aleppo bombings, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her government would consider new sanctions against Moscow. Over objections from Italy, European Union leaders backed off immediate threats of sanctions against Russia.\nMr. Putin on Thursday placed the blame for the breakdown of the Syrian cease-fire squarely on the U.S., where he said political forces had worked to undermine the deal.\n“In Washington there were forces who did everything so that these [agreements over Syria] were not implemented in practice,” he said. “It would have seemed that after lengthy negotiations, huge efforts, and difficult compromises, we would have finally formulated a united front against terrorism, but that’s not what happened.”\nWrite to Laura Mills at Laura.Mills@wsj.com\nSave Article\n	wsj	World

Russian naval capabilities haven’t been modernized as much as its air force or ground units?and the air power the Kuznetsov can bring is limited, the officials said.\nStill, the deployment has received international attention. Russia has stirred up tensions within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with Spain initially granting Russia permission to refuel some ships only to have the request withdrawn as pressure mounted on Madrid.\nRussian officials have said that the ships have enough fuel to continue their mission. One of the ships that is part of the flotilla, the Osipov, was off the coast of Morocco on Thursday, according to MarineTraffic.com.\nThe Russian deployment to Syria comes as Russia has been bolstering its military forces in multiple regions, including adding ships to the Baltic Sea and deploying nuclear-capable missiles to Crimea.\nNATO has been building up its own forces in the Baltic and Black Sea regions, with allies pledging new contributions this week in Brussels, including British and German tanks headed to the Baltic states. Canada will send 450 soldiers and Light Armored Vehicles, a wheeled military transport similar to American Strykers.\nCanadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said NATO’s four battle groups were clearly defensive. And he added that the alliance has been completely transparent about its operations, announcing them months in advance.\n“That’s what true deterrence is, to be able to show what we have, so there is no misconception, no fear that is created out of what you are doing,” Mr. Sajjan said.\nMr. Sajjan said Russia wasn’t behaving as a responsible world power, adding NATO’s moves were about getting “Russia back to a constructive and productive dialogue.”\nAlexander Grushko, Russia’s ambassador to NATO, said taken in total NATO and member countries were undertaking a significant buildup and conducting a string of military exercises on Russia’s borders.\n“Despite all the talk about openness to dialogue, in fact, at the present stage NATO’s focus is primarily on the development and deepening of the policy of comprehensive military and political containment of Russia,” Mr. Grushko said.\nU.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, briefed NATO defense ministers on Wednesday on the Russian capabilities, noting its military modernization, command overhaul, nuclear missile tests and deployments of nuclear-capable missiles to the Kaliningrad exclave.\n“What we are observing is Russian military practice that diverges widely from NATO practice in scale, scope, content, purpose, and transparency,” Gen. Scaparrotti said Thursday in a brief statement.\nIn addition to its investments in new aircraft, more powerful missiles, and better trained troops, Russia has also overhauled its military doctrine and operating procedures, casting aside Cold War tactics.\nThey have used both their deployment in Syria and military exercises on NATO’s borders to showcase more modern and effective ways of exercising military might, according to U.S. and alliance officials.\nThat includes prioritizing quick military interventions, often begun under the cover of drills or exercises, to achieve a degree of surprise.\nBoth the deployment to Syria and a separate deployment of two other warships to the Baltic Sea have focused attention on Russia’s ability to deploy to multiple areas simultaneously, according to U.S. and western officials.\nAnd officials note, Russia has developed weaponry?like sea-launched cruise missiles?that demonstrate its growing military might.\n“They are showing their ability to operate in multiple places and show capabilities that they didn’t used to have,” said a U.S. defense official.\n?Richard Boudreaux in Madrid and James Marson in Moscow contributed to this article.\nWrite to Julian E.

Photo: tt news agency/Reuters\nBy\n44 COMMENTS\nGOTLAND, Sweden?The 150 Swedish soldiers dispatched to this Baltic Sea island for short, routine training last month received an unexpected order: Stay put. The decision made them the country’s first permanent force here in more than a decade.\nThe deployment is officially a first step to boost Sweden’s homeland defense at a moment when the Baltic Sea has again become a hotbed of East-West tensions , nearly a quarter-century after the downfall of the Soviet Union.\nBut experts say the move in Gotland?which is some 20 minutes by air to the Russian coast?carries bigger geopolitical significance: Sweden has all but abandoned the neutral stance it projected during the Cold War and is now firmly siding with NATO and helping it shore up Europe’s eastern flank, as Russia builds up its military capabilities in the region.\n“Sweden is no longer part of any buffer zone,” said Sten Tolgfors, who was Swedish defense minister between 2007 and 2012. “That’s an idea from the old days.”\nWhile joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a full-fledged member isn’t on its agenda, Sweden has been moving closer to the Western alliance through programs of shared training and military equipment over recent years.\nIn May, Swedish lawmakers removed administrative hurdles that could have prevented NATO forces from operating effectively in the country during a crisis or conflict. The overhaul cleared up tax rules when NATO troops are based in Sweden and clarified who would care for their basic needs.\n“It’s at the level of who would provide the food and the toilet paper,” said Colonel Oscar Hull, whose department oversees military procurement at the Swedish combined forces headquarters.\nThe country’s tilt toward NATO comes as Russian jet fighters have been increasingly cutting through Swedish airspace during training exercises in the Baltic, prompting an angry response from the government. Swedish forces also have supported NATO-led missions in the Balkans, Afghanistan and North Africa.\nFinland, which shares an 833-mile border with Russia, and has traditionally followed a neutral line, is also steadily drifting toward the Western alliance. In July, Finnish President Sauli Niinist?, together with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L?fven, attended a dinner of NATO heads of states in Warsaw, a rare event for non-NATO members.\n“The continual development of military cooperation with NATO is one of the key elements through which Finland maintains and develops its national defense,” said Janne Kuusela, head of Finland’s Defense Policy Department. In Sweden, Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said his country has been and will continue to be an active partner with NATO as a military nonaligned country.\nNATO said Finland and Sweden were among its most active partners. “We share the same values, we face the same security challenges, and we have a common approach to the security situation,” Dylan White, acting NATO spokesman, said.\nSweden and Finland boast sizable army forces, and their shift toward the alliance could give it a much-needed capacity boost in the Baltic area, where Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and even Poland have limited firepower. But the disappearance of neutral parties in the region, experts say, could also create a more volatile environment.\nDuring the Cold War, Sweden and Finland sought to use their access to the U.S. and Russia to ease regional tension, said Sven Hirdman, Sweden’s ambassador to Moscow between 1994 and 2004.\n“Finland and Sweden played a fairly useful role in proposals for disarmament and detente,” he said.? “It was appreciated by both the U.S. and Russia.”\nSweden’s neutrality traces back to the 19th-century Napoleonic Wars, when the Nordic country lost Finland to Russia. Throughout the Cold War, Sweden claimed neutrality, building up an extensive defense force independent of both the West and Moscow. It kept a standing army that ran into the hundreds of thousands and developed an advanced air force and navy.\nAmong the main proponents of Sweden’s Cold War stance was longtime Social Democrat leader Olof Palme, who credited Sweden’s neutrality with keeping the country out of armed conflict.\n“We won’t budge a millimeter of a step when it comes to asserting our neutrality and Sweden’s independence which has given us peace for 170 years,” he said in a statement to parliament in 1985.\nA decade later, Sweden amended its approach to neutrality when it joined the European Union. In doing so, it committed itself politically to supporting its neighbors in times of crisis or conflict. It chose, however, to stay out of NATO, in which the U.S., the U.K. and other members have a collective duty to assist each other militarily if any state is attacked.\nSweden’s left-leaning minority government in September restated its commitment to remain outside of the alliance after a parliament-commissioned report took an exhaustive look at the advantages and disadvantages of the country’s current stance.\n“Our aim is to reduce tension” Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom told reporters at a briefing in September. “Would Sweden joining NATO reduce tension? No it would not,” she said.\nRussia hasn’t complained about Sweden’s tighter relations with NATO but has said a formal adhesion would be regarded as an aggressive move. “Of course we in Russia would take the necessary military technical measures,” Russia’s ambassador to Sweden, Viktor Tatarintsev, told Swedish radio earlier this month.\nIn the U.S., some officials believe formally bringing Sweden into the alliance could trigger a crisis with Russia. Any move to offer membership would take months or years to approve and ratify, giving Russia ample time to try to destabilize the region, the officials say.\nOn a recent Saturday, Swedish air force Captain Jorgen Olsson ran a training session for fighter pilots on Gotland. From the communications system to the missiles under the wings of planes, the machinery is now completely in tune with NATO standards, he said.\n“You could take any Swedish squadron and put them in any NATO-led operation and it would just work,” the captain said.\n?Julian E.

1023426	http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-vladimir-putin-test-1476991229	The Vladimir Putin Test	2016-10-29 00:00:00	11 COMMENTS\nThese are grim days for fans of liberal international order?or “globalists,” to use the preferred slur among Donald Trump ’s online minions.\nThe liberal idea?the philosophy of individual rights and free markets that forms the common ground of mainstream politics in the West?is battered and unloved. Mr. Trump’s takeover of the GOP was only the latest and most depressing sign. Republicans, co-architects of the postwar liberal order, have now put their presidential hopes in a nominee who denigrates NATO, calls for scrapping major trade deals, and rants about foreign bankers and disloyal Americans out to destroy U.S. sovereignty.\nWhatever happens on Nov. 8, this illiberal tide won’t soon recede, certainly not in Europe. The illiberals know what they want, and they know how to share their vision in the age of the Twitter troll. Mr. Trump wasn’t the first to hit upon “globalism” as the enemy of wholesome national solidarity. Such ideas have deeper roots in Europe, where Mr. Trump’s kindred spirits are more disciplined and articulate. Marine Le Pen doesn’t speak in free-association gibberish.\nMost important, the illiberals have found a global leader, not in Mr. Trump, but in Vladimir Putin . The Russian strongman uses his sleek broadcast networks to boost Moscow-friendly parties across the West, usually on the far right. But more helpful than his propaganda efforts for the illiberals is the ideological alternative Mr. Putin offers. Once again, the illiberals rejoice, liberalism has a rival. (Islamism, though savage and deadly, was never a serious contender.)\nMr. Putin thus presents a clarifying moral and political acid test in the West.\nHere’s one version of the test: Do you see Mr. Putin heading a thuggish, authoritarian regime that murders dissidents and threatens Western security and interests? Or do you see him as an avatar of national sovereignty and Christian vigor, a bulwark against a decadent liberalism more concerned with transgender bathrooms than with policing the West’s borders or taking care of workers hammered by globalization?\nIt shouldn’t escape notice that nearly all of Europe’s ascendant illiberals take the second view. Ms. Le Pen’s National Front in France, the Alternative for Germany movement, Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party and the even nastier Jobbik, the Austrian Freedom Party, Britain’s UKIP?all welcome Mr. Putin’s project to varying degrees. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán expressed their position most succinctly when he mused in 2014 about “building an illiberal state” with Russia (and China) as models.\nMr. Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly expressed admiration for Mr. Putin and even apologized for the Russian’s rights record by suggesting that the U.S. government is equally murderous. His GOP defenders say Mr. Trump’s apparent affinity for the Kremlin is nonideological. Yet the New York developer’s statements have been frequent and sustained enough to suggest there’s more than personal vanity at work, while a distinct Putinophilia marks the wider Trumpian orbit.\nFor those who wish to preserve the world of unprecedented prosperity and cultural dynamism that liberalism has created, it isn’t enough to insist that Mr. Putin runs a thugocracy.\nIt isn’t enough to point out that the supposedly devout Mr. Putin is moving to severely restrict worship and missionary activity in Russia for all faiths except Russian Orthodoxy?or that Orthodox Christianity doesn’t sanction Kremlin-scale graft for that matter.\nIt isn’t enough, finally, to note how this defender of sovereignty is trying to subjugate sovereign nations across the former Soviet space.\nMost voters in Europe and the U.S. get all this, notwithstanding the estimated $300 million the Kremlin spends annually on Russia Today alone. They get it, and yet many still flock to leaders who fail the Putin moral acid test. And the main reason is that liberal order has suffered a decade of lousy leadership on both sides of the Atlantic.\nUnder President Obama, Angela Merkel , Fran?ois Hollande and the like, the liberal vision really has been reduced to fighting for transgender bathroom rights as the world burns. For Mr. Obama, liberal order really does mean endless multilateralism and diplomatic procedure for their own sake. The European equivalent, pressed by the likes of Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Hollande, is the idea of “more Europe,” more European Union “norms” and bureaucracy, as the solution to every crisis.\nLiberal leaders couldn’t afford to look so feeble for so long without making the liberal-democratic model look feeble?and the Putinist alternative decisive and strong. It will likely fall to President Hillary Clinton to reverse this ideological balance of forces. Let’s hope she brings all her supposedly centrist instincts to the Oval Office. For now, it’s no small relief that a Republican nominee who so manifestly failed the Putin test seems to be heading for a thumping at the polls.\nSave Article\n	wsj	World

Game 7 is scheduled to start at 8:08 p.m. ET.\nSHARE\nUpdates\nCubs Beat Indians 9-3 in Game 6 of World Series\nThe Cubs won , 9-3. There will be a Game 7 tomorrow night. The Indians will send Corey Kluber to the mound while the Cubs will counter with Kyle Hendricks. It should be a good time. Thanks for following along tonight.\nMax Cohen\nFacebook\nTwitter\nThe Indians have cut the lead to six with a double from Roberto Perez. Perez, though, was thrown out at second. Not exactly ideal for a last-ditch comeback. There are two outs in the inning.\nMax Cohen\nFacebook\nTwitter\nThe Indians' largest comeback of the regular season was four runs and they never scored more than seven runs in a single inning. Chapman will remain in the game.\nMax Cohen\nFacebook\nTwitter\nWe are going to the bottom of the ninth. The Indians need seven runs to tie.\nMax Cohen\nFacebook\nTwitter\nAndrew: I enjoy the radical suggestion.

I think there will be a Game 7.\nChicago Cubs' Anthony Rizzo hits a two-run home run during the ninth inning of Game 6.AP Photo/David J. Phillip\nMax Cohen\nFacebook\nTwitter\nOK, so part of the logic in using Chapman in the 8th is that taking him out risks not having him if things tighten up. And he had already used Montgomery, so the best options in the Chicago bullpen were thinning.\nSo here's a crazy idea. We've already seen some bullpen madness this postseason, but this is wilder: Why not put Chapman in the outfield? After he got out of the 7th, it would have left him available to come back in if things got hairy. But he also wouldn't have needed to pitch more and potentially tire himself if the rest of the Cubs bullpen breezed by. Sure, there are complications, but Maddon already put relievers in the outfield earlier this season.\nAndrew Beaton\nFacebook\nTwitter\nChapman allows a runner to reach base but he followed it up by inducing a double play. The Cubs lead by five going into the ninth inning. If we're looking ahead to the bottom of the inning, the Indians are scheduled to send Guyer, Davis and Perez to the plate.\nMax Cohen\nFacebook\nTwitter\nAnybody here going to stick up for Joe Maddon sticking with Chapman here in the 8th, up 7-2?\nPretty much the most controversial move imaginable for a manager leading 7-2 in Game 6 of the World Series, with the season on the line. Unless he put in Schwarber to pitch. That'd be pretty controversial.\nAndrew Beaton\nFacebook\nTwitter\nClevinger recovers after a leadoff walk and the Indians will go to the plate in the bottom of the eighth still behind by five runs.\nMax Cohen\nFacebook\nTwitter\nChapman appeared to hurt himself covering first. He wasn't limping noticeably coming off the field but appeared to be walking gingerly. Man, if that ends up coming back to bite the Cubs tomorrow, what a costly thing for them to have needed to use him there...\nBrian Costa\nFacebook\nTwitter\nThe seventh inning is over after Chapman barely beats Lindor to first base on a ground ball. The Cubs still have their five-run lead.\nMax Cohen\nFacebook\nTwitter\nThe Cubs are bringing in Aroldis Chapman in the seventh inning. This is a victory for the Indians.\nJared Diamond\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTerry Francona deserves all the credit for his masterful management of the Cleveland bullpen this postseason. But I think it's only fair to ask: Was turning to starters on short rest the right call?\nIt was no problem for Kluber. But it was far less fine for Tomlin today.\nGoing to guys on short rest with a series lead is how the Mets lost the 1973 World Series. They led the A's 3-2 after the first five games of the series, and Mets manager Yogi Berra turned to ace Tom Seaver on short rest for Game 6 in an attempt to finish it off. Seaver lost Game 6, although he pitched well. The bigger problem was in Game 7 when Jon Matlack had to go on short rest as a result of starting Seaver in Game 6. Matlack allowed four runs and didn't get out of the third inning. The Mets lost the series in seven.\nAndrew Beaton\nFacebook\nTwitter\nIf a baseball game can be called on account of rain can a live blog be called on account of a blowout?\nMatthew Futterman\n	wsj	U.S.
