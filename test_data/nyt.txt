Getty Images\nPope Francis on Wednesday urged “all people of good will” to join in condemning “these cruel abominations that are causing only death, terror and horror.” The pope made his remarks at his weekly general audience in St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican.\nAssuring victims and families of his spiritual closeness, Francis said that he hoped God would “convert the hearts of these people blinded by this cruel fundamentalism.”\nThe Holy See had already expressed the pope’s sympathy for the dead, the wounded and their relatives on Tuesday, through a message sent by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, to Jozef De Kesel, the archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels and the top Roman Catholic prelate in Belgium, and released by the Vatican .\nOn Thursday, as part of an Easter Week ritual, Francis will wash the feet of a dozen young refugees ? mostly non-Catholics ? at an asylum center in a town north of Rome, recalling Jesus’ gesture of humility and service before his crucifixion. The asylum center was chosen to highlight the pope’s proximity to refugees, in light of the migration crisis. It is not the first time that the Holy See has selected non-Catholics to participate in the ritual.\n“By washing the refugees’ feet, Pope Francis is asking for respect for each one of them,” a Vatican official, Archbishop Salvatore Fisichella wrote in the Vatican’s newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano, on Wednesday.\nThe fact that most of the young refugees are non-Catholic eloquently “points to respect as the royal road to peace,” he added.\n	New York Times	World

The media are as constrained as during military rule. Pressure on journalists, including physical attacks, has risen. Several journalists have been fired from their newspapers for criticizing the government. Foreign reporters have been detained while covering the Kurdish conflict. Opposition news organizations have been seized by the government. Their offices have been raided, and some of their staff are on trial on terrorism charges. The few opposition media outlets remaining are under constant pressure by the ruling party.\nTurkey's  vulnerabilities are making NATO membership more valuable and giving the organization more leverage for change.\nSince the ruling Justice and Development Party's stunning victory in November, President Erdogan has moved even more aggressively to neutralize all those who might challenge his rule -- not just in the media but also in the business sector, civil society and opposition parties. With governing-party loyalists in top posts, the judiciary has lost the little independence it had, becoming an instrument of the ruling party to silence and punish its political opponents.\nWith no institutions that can check the government's, particularly Erdogan's, power and very few critical news media outlets left, there is not much the opposition parties can do to put Turkish democracy back on track. It needs an outside push.\nIn the past, the European Union played that role. Through membership negotiations, the E.U. has pushed for democratic reforms in Turkey. Recently, however, the E.U. seems to have put Turkish democracy on the back burner in return for Turkey's cooperation in stemming the refugee flow.\nNATO has never played the historic role the E.U. played in Turkey's democratization. Instead, it took a pragmatic approach to Turkey's internal politics to secure Turkey's cooperation. NATO turned a blind eye to several military coups during the cold war and supported the military regime with military assistance.\nYet, the psychological dimension of Turkey's NATO membership has anchored the country to the West and provided an important source of leverage for NATO countries. That leverage is even greater today.\nTurkey has become increasingly marginalized in the Middle East. It is overseen by a belligerent Russia and threatened by the chaos in Iraq and civil war in Syria. Turkey's regional troubles and vulnerabilities are making NATO membership much more valuable for Ankara.\nAt a time when Erdogan feels more invincible and the opposition more desperate than ever, Turkish democracy needs an outside push. Now that the E.U. has more urgent needs in its relationship with Turkey, NATO could provide that push toward greater democracy. But to do so, the organization needs to drop its pragmatic approach and remember that it is not just a community for shared defense but of shared values based on a common commitment to democracy.\n	New York Times	World
384302	http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/03/29/does-turkey-still-belong-in-nato/nato-must-demand-more-from-turkey	NATO Must Demand More From Turkey	2016-03-31 00:00:00	The Opinion Pages\nNATO Must Demand More From?Turkey\nHalil M. Karaveli is a senior fellow at the Central Asia?Caucasus Institute and Silk Road Studies Program’s Joint Center, where he heads the Turkey Initiative. He is also the editor of the Turkey Analyst.\nUpdated March 29, 2016,  3:20 AM\nTurkey has always been an awkward NATO member. Since it joined in 1952, the country has rarely lived up to official alliance standards of democracy and human rights. During most of this time, Turkey has been ruled by authoritarian governments. Even when elected governments were in power, Turkey was at best an illiberal “democracy” as right-wing authoritarianism and rigid nationalism were always influential. In that sense, there is nothing that is new with Turkey’s authoritarian “drift” today.\nIf NATO told Turkey that if it does not respect democratic standards, its membership will be called into question, Ankara would pay attention.\nTurkey’s strategic value as a “sentinel” during the Cold War, as the eastern outpost of the Western alliance, gave the Turkish regime a tacit license to violate political freedoms and minority rights. This is an historical pattern that keeps being repeated.\nSince last year, the Turkish army has deployed tanks and artillery against parts of its own population, against which NATO has not objected. On the contrary, Turkey enjoys NATO support in combating “terrorism.” Under this pretext, the Turkish armed forces have destroyed several Kurdish cities in the southeast of the country, killing hundreds of civilians and forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee.\nIt is a common mistake to attribute everything that has lately gone wrong in Turkey solely to President Erdogan. In fact, Erdogan has entered into an alliance with the military, which has regained much of its former power. Erdogan is executing policies that have been prescribed by the Turkish general staff. Turkey's meddling in Syria -- supporting diverse jihadist groups in order to check the Kurds -- is also fully in line with the nationalist, anti-Kurdish priorities of the Turkish military, and this policy is being conducted in concert between the civilian government and the military.\nIf Turkey continues to lay its Kurdish cities to rubble, it will become increasingly difficult to keep up the fiction that it belongs in NATO, to maintain that it embraces any of the democratic values that the Western alliance purports to stand for. But, Turkey’s NATO membership offers the alliance leverage. It’s only that Turkey has never before had to make a choice between continued NATO membership and authoritarian practices; it has always been able to have it both ways.\nFor once, NATO ought to try to influence Turkish policy in a liberal direction. Being isolated from the West is something that the Turkish regime fears. Therefore, if NATO were to tell Turkey that if it does not respect democratic standards, its membership will be called into question, Ankara is going to pay attention. Ultimately, the question is not so much “does Turkey belong in NATO” as “how much does NATO stand for the values that it is officially committed to?”\n	New York Times	World

He is on Twitter .\nUpdated March 29, 2016,  3:20 AM\nWhen then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan last visited Washington in 2013, he received the full “valued ally” treatment, including an appearance with President Obama in the White House Rose Garden.\nNobody wants Turkey out of NATO, after years of military investments and  alliance building. But its membership is harder and harder to justify.\nNot this time. Now president, Erdogan will instead meet with Vice President Biden this week, which is the diplomatic equivalent of a handshake after a romantic date.\nThe cool reception is not just a Washington thing. Europeans, scornful of his relentless crackdown on the opposition at home, don’t care much for the Turkish president. Arab states like Jordan don’t particularly\nappreciate him these days, either. And even some within NATO grumble that Turkey’s unofficial role as a buffer to both Russia and the Middle East has spoiled like month-old peynir .\nAdmittedly, Turkey is among the few standing up to Russia these days. It was the Turkish military that shot down a Russian jet back in December as Vladimir Putin flexed his muscles in Syria. But NATO members hit the panic button over the very possibility that Ankara might invoke Article V and summon them to intervene.\nBut it’s not just recklessness that has NATO spooked. Turkey’s border with Syria since the civil war erupted in 2011 has become a zone of illicit finance. A steady stream of reports suggests that Turkey has been providing material or even military support to jihadists groups (from the Nusra Front to Ahrar al-Sham to even the Islamic State) that a member of NATO has no business backing. Meanwhile, Turkey’s renewed war on the Kurds has greatly complicated the U.S. efforts to battle the Islamic State by proxy.\nIstanbul has also become a headquarters for the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. The war between Hamas and Israel in 2014 was, in fact, prompted by an attack planned and financed from Turkey-based Hamas figure Saleh Arouri.\nAnkara was also involved in a gas-for-gold scheme that helped Iran evade international sanctions between 2012 and 2013 ? a time when Washington and Brussels needed Turkey’s help most. Ankara was again exposed for helping Iran evade sanctions when an Istanbul prosecutor’s report leaked in March 2014, pointing to hundreds of millions of laundered profits for Iran, with massive volume transiting through Turkey. In fact, the central figure in the schemes, Reza Zarrab, was arrested in Miami last week for conspiring to evade American sanctions on an enormous scale.\nIn short, Turkey is increasingly an awkward fit in a multilateral organization dedicated to preserving the values of the West. Nobody really wants Turkey to go, after years of military investments and tireless alliance building. But it’s getting harder and harder to justify. A reckoning is needed.\n	New York Times	World

Mr. Robertson’s colleague Nicola Sturgeon, the party’s leader and the first minister of Scotland, was the first national leader to release her tax returns; her decision to do so, over the weekend, prompted Prime Minister David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the main opposition, the Labour Party, to do the same.\nMr. Cameron reiterated a theme of Monday afternoon’s debate: distinguishing illegal trusts from legitimate “unit trusts” that, he said, are a “totally legitimate way of investing” by pension funds and other institutions, among others.\nMr. Cameron also told Mr. Robertson that he did not envision adding substantial new sections to the criminal code, beyond his proposal ? announced minutes earlier ? to punish companies that fail to prevent their employees from illegally avoiding taxes.\nMr. Cameron acknowledged to Mr. Robertson that “for years there was a reputational, and potentially a real, problem” with Britain’s dependencies and territories ? like the British Virgin Islands ??that have been used as tax shelters or havens for money laundering or graver offenses.\nWith the overhaul, Mr. Cameron said, Britain’s territories will by no means be the worst offenders. He said that several states in the United States were even worse. While he did not name any, advocates of financial transparency have long criticized the design of laws in Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming, states often used to incorporate offshore companies and trusts.\n	New York Times	World

And there were no major policy announcements.\nStill, the parliamentary debate was the most vigorous discussion of the use of offshore bank accounts and shell companies to conceal personal wealth or avoid taxes since the Panama Papers were released.\nIt was also a chance for Britain’s two main parties to lay out their competing visions.\nMr. Cameron defended his father’s use of offshore funds and ? after an initially clumsy response to reports based on the leaked documents from a Panamanian law firm ??he said he had now disclosed more about his personal finances than any of his predecessors.\nBefore and After the Panama Papers: David Cameron of Britain on Tax Avoidance\nBy KIMIKO DE FREYTAS-TAMURA\nThe prime minister has condemned offshore accounts used to avoid taxes, but leaked documents show that his family has profited from an offshore investment fund.\nMr. Cameron also promised new criminal penalties for companies that fail to prevent their employees from facilitating tax evasion, and promised greater transparency by British territories and dependencies that are often used as tax havens.\nThe opposition Labour Party, whose leader, Jeremy Corbyn, embodies the party’s leftward shift, failed to score any knockout punches, but underscored a basic theme that has resonated with voters on both sides of the Atlantic: The rules of the game are rigged to favor “the superrich,” as Mr. Corbyn put it . And at least one of his parliamentary allies drew connections between that perceived unfairness and London’s soaring home prices ? perhaps the most pressing issue  as the capital prepares for mayoral elections next month.\nMr. Cameron’s Conservatives defended themselves as the party of people who want to get ahead in life; the prime minister called the Labour Party an “enemy of aspiration,” and one lawmaker decried the Labour Party’s “politics of envy.”\nDavid Cameron Releases Tax Data After Panama Papers Uproar\nBy STEVEN ERLANGER\nMr. Cameron, the British prime minister, admitted that he had bungled his response to questions about his inheritance from his father, who had an offshore investment company.\nAlthough the disclosure rules have not changed, the public debate has set off a race to release tax returns. Nicola Sturgeon, the most powerful politician in Scotland, shared her finances over the weekend, and she was quickly joined by Mr. Cameron ; Mr. Corbyn; George Osborne, who as chancellor of the Exchequer is the second-most powerful figure in government; and Mayor Boris Johnson of London.\nRobert Palmer, a campaigner with Global Witness, an international anticorruption organization, said on Twitter that he found the issue of personal tax returns “a distraction from the bigger question of how U.K. tax havens fuel corruption,” but added that Mr. Cameron deserved credit for working to make ownership of assets in Britain more transparent and for pushing the world’s other major economies in the same direction.\nCameron tax row seems like a distraction from the urgent reform needed in the UK-linked tax havens.

Getty Images\nMonday afternoon’s debate in Parliament over the Panama Papers scandal was an open discussion of the role of wealth and privilege in Britain.\nPrime Minister David Cameron is a graduate of Eton College, one of the country’s most prestigious boarding schools, and of Oxford University.\nMr. Cameron had said, in the days since the revelations from the Panama Papers, “I’ve never hidden the fact that I’m a very lucky person.”\n“I had wealthy parents who gave me a great upbringing, who paid for me to go to an amazing school,” he said. “I’ve never tried to be anything that I’m not.”\nStill, the news that his father had an offshore investment company, and that the prime minister had sold shares in the fund at a profit , has been embarrassing for the Conservative Party.\nOne member of the party, Michael Fabricant, who represents the Lichfield constituency in Staffordshire in the West Midlands, came to Mr. Cameron’s defense.\n“He should not be ashamed that the had the good fortune to be born into a well-off family,” Mr. Fabricant said. “It’s not a sin for his parents, quite naturally, to want their savings to be cascaded down through the generations. He has nothing to be ashamed of.”\nMr. Fabricant said: “No matter how much information he wants to divulge, nothing will satisfy some of those people on the Labour front bench.”\nMr. Cameron used the opportunity?to reiterate his earlier position that existing disclosure rules for members of Parliament were adequate. He noted that he had fended off demands that lawmakers and cabinet members be required to disclose all of their personal financial interests.\nWhile members of the Labour Party have moved further to the left in recent years ? notably by electing Jeremy Corbyn, a far-left backbencher, as the party’s leader last year ? the Conservative Party has tried to position itself as being in the center of the political spectrum.\nJust this month, Mr. Cameron noted, the government raised the standard personal allowance ??the amount of income individuals do not have to pay tax on ? to ?11,000, or about $15,700, from ?10,600.\n12:04 pm ET Apr 11, 2016 2016-04-11T16:06:26+00:00\nWho’s Coming to the Anticorruption Summit Meeting?\nI think it’s fair to say the guest list is still being worked on.\n?

One is the question of individual tax evaders versus the havens ? including the British Virgin Islands ? that are seen as facilitating tax avoidance.  Another is the question of transparency and disclosure.\n“Can the prime minister guarantee that the law will make offshore tax dodging illegal?” asked Liz Saville Roberts, a member of Parliament with the Welsh party Plaid Cymru.\nPrime Minister David Cameron noted that tax evasion was already illegal and called it an issue separate from the sharing of information across jurisdictions, and the ability to examine who are the owners of companies.\nBut he added, “We shouldn’t use that to say that it’s wrong for people or trade unions or companies or pension schemes to invest in unit trusts listed in other countries.”\nUnit trusts, sometimes also known as open-ended funds, allow investors to buy an ownership stake in a range of investments, which are managed by a fund manager. They are common investment vehicles.\n“The unit trust does not exist to make money for itself,” Mr. Cameron said. The investors are the ones who make or lose money, and are responsible for the taxes on any gains, he said.\nBut the fact that so many of these investment vehicles are based overseas has itself become politically sensitive ? the vast majority of individual investors do not participate in such funds.\n11:56 am ET Apr 11, 2016 2016-04-11T16:19:24+00:00\nLabour Member Links Transparency to High Home Prices in London\nVideo: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nWhat is the prime minister now going to do about dirty money propping up the London property market?\n?

Mr. Robertson’s colleague Nicola Sturgeon, the party’s leader and the first minister of Scotland, was the first national leader to release her tax returns; her decision to do so, over the weekend, prompted Prime Minister David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the main opposition, the Labour Party, to do the same.\nMr. Cameron reiterated a theme of Monday afternoon’s debate: distinguishing illegal trusts from legitimate “unit trusts” that, he said, are a “totally legitimate way of investing” by pension funds and other institutions, among others.\nMr. Cameron also told Mr. Robertson that he did not envision adding substantial new sections to the criminal code, beyond his proposal ? announced minutes earlier ? to punish companies that fail to prevent their employees from illegally avoiding taxes.\nMr. Cameron acknowledged to Mr. Robertson that “for years there was a reputational, and potentially a real, problem” with Britain’s dependencies and territories ? like the British Virgin Islands ??that have been used as tax shelters or havens for money laundering or graver offenses.\nWith the overhaul, Mr. Cameron said, Britain’s territories will by no means be the worst offenders. He said that several states in the United States were even worse. While he did not name any, advocates of financial transparency have long criticized the design of laws in Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming, states often used to incorporate offshore companies and trusts.\n11:13 am ET Apr 11, 2016 2016-04-11T16:24:44+00:00\nSewell Chan\nCameron Says Labour Party Is ‘Enemy of Aspiration’\nPrime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who appeared to have a strong command of policy details, pointed out that Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, had himself delayed releasing his tax disclosures until midafternoon Monday.\nMr. Cameron said he had gone through all of his financial holdings with the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, covering his financial interests and his relationships with family and friends.\nHe said the Labour Party was, under the guise of promoting transparency, pursuing its real agenda of raising the inheritance tax. “If you want to pass your home to your children, they will tax it,” he said, warming to his theme that the Labour Party would crush individual initiative and opportunity.\n“They are the enemy of aspiration” and of families wanting to advance their station in life, Mr. Cameron said, “and that’s the real lesson of today,”\n11:10 am ET Apr 11, 2016 2016-04-11T16:42:06+00:00\nWatch: Cameron Describes Disclosure of His Tax Information\nVideo: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nPrime Minister David Cameron spoke to Parliament about his decision to publish tax information from the last six years.\n11:04 am ET Apr 11, 2016 2016-04-11T16:43:15+00:00\nSewell Chan\nA Call for Independent Investigation Into the Panama Papers\nPhoto\nJeremy Corbyn, Labour party leader, spoke in Parliament following a statement by Prime Minister David Cameron.Credit Agence France-Presse ?

Willis James professor of mission and world Christianity at Yale Divinity School and professor of history and international and area studies at Yale University.  He is the author of " Whose Religion Is Christianity? The Gospel Beyond the West."\nApril 11, 2016\nIn his apostolic manifesto, "Amoris Laetitia," or “The Joy of Love,” Pope Francis has signaled a cautious but important shift in the church’s attitude to those living in “irregular” situations, including divorced and gay Catholics. Drawing on the spirit of the law in Catholic teaching and responding to the pressure of worldwide rapid social change, the pope is challenging the church to come to where people are rather than throwing laws and regulations like stones from a distance.\nThis is a powerful step forward, and it will help the Catholic Church to grow and thrive.\nThe pope's shift shows that he recognizes a disenchantment among Catholics that can not be resolved by even more edicts that force Catholics to choose between believing and belonging.\nThe pope’s view that priests and bishops should be free to welcome estranged Catholics indicates his recognition of the desire for change and what that implies for the contemporary resurgence of the church beyond the West. He wants the application of unbending rules to give way to engagement in love and empathy. He knows that families continue to face stress and uncertainty from economic and political forces, and he's telling his followers that the church is in solidarity with them and will reflect their lives ? within limits -- in terms of how, who and where they are.\nThe shift Pope Francis has signaled recognizes that disenchantment among Catholics cannot be resolved by resorting to even more edicts in which rigorous enforcement of these laws simply  forces Catholics to choose between believing and belonging.  The devolution of power to the local church will help pastors be more effective in meeting the needs of parishioners and in overcoming inertia and relieving tension.\nThe initiatives Pope Francis has unveiled fall short of the demand of divorced Catholics and gays and women for full inclusion, but by design there is a crack in the door. There is a  Catholic spring in the air in which consensus will now have to reckon with the need for generosity and mutual care. The church cannot shut the door to faith and recovery. The patience and forbearance of those who have endured decades of condemnation and estrangement will now be rewarded by the actions of conscientious priests and bishops willing to give enforcement a human face.\nThe emphasis  on "local needs" is not so much a break from Catholic teaching as it is an engagement with the world that  the church encounters today. It is a  time of great hope for the Catholic Church.\n	New York Times	World

It is true that as Catholics we believe everything reflects the infinite goodness of God, but the church’s mission is to draw people to authentic happiness by teaching them what is ultimately good, and what stands in the way of human fulfillment. While we should have compassion for everyone, it is not compassionate to pretend that a sin is not a sin.\nHe wants pastors to affirm everyone's conscience, without worrying too much whether our consciences are confused or wrong.\nMost disturbing in Francis's exhortation is his desire that priests affirm the situations of divorced Catholics who are living with a second spouse ? even contemplating with them the possibility of communion while living in sin.\nThe tradition of Catholic morality is firm and unequivocal: a Catholic marriage is dissolved only by death. To be in an illicit second marriage is a sin, and all of us need to repent of our sins before receiving communion. This is a hard truth ? that much has been clear since the first century ? but there are times when hard truths need to be spoken.  Sometimes it's necessary to correct people, for their own good and the good of everyone who might be led astray by them.\nLeading people astray is certainly not something Francis seems to worry about.  He wants us to "make a mess."  He wants pastors to affirm everyone's conscience, without worrying too much whether our consciences are confused or wrong.  In the short run, this will make a lot of people in dubious moral situations feel better, and may make the church seem more welcoming and compassionate.  But this short-term gain comes at the expense of long-term confusion about divine truth, right living and the requirements for human fulfillment.  Since leading people to happiness in God is the mission of the church, this trade off seems devastatingly ill conceived.\n	New York Times	World

They could stay in the church and observe norms about not receiving communion, or they could find a priest who would give them communion anyway.  So, Pope Francis’s encouragement to priests to have conversations and find solutions with the divorced among the faithful won't change much.  The priests who are open to it are already doing it.\nAt the same time, priests reluctant to reconsider norms on communion are by no means forced to have these conversations now.  Amoris Laetitia leaves more room for local decision-making and Christian conscience when it comes to these matters, but that includes the consciences of local conservative priests.\nThe most immediate practical effect of Amoris Laetitia, then, is the advancement of Francis’s continued public relations makeover of the Roman church: He is emphasizing conscience, declericalizing authority and, most important, substituting the language of mercy and welcome for what so many inside and outside the church had perceived as legalism and exclusion.\nLittle in Amoris Laetitia is new for the Roman church. Interpretation of scripture and “acculturation” of the church to different contexts always found a place in Catholic tradition. The Second Vatican council resulted in 16 documents between 1962 and 1965, many of which emphasized the primacy of conscience and local governance ? that the church is the people of God . Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI, in the years since Vatican II, moved away from those themes, emphasizing the authority of the papacy and trying to draw a sharp contrast between Catholicism and the postmodern world.\nThat is to say: Francis is just bringing back some older traditions.\nHis conservative opponents tend to uphold a stronger centralized papacy, but they might recoil from Francis enough to reject his advice on handling the situation of divorced and remarried Catholics. In that case, they will take up Francis's offer of localism and decentralization, so Francis's agenda gains ground either way.\nStill, there is already widespread recognition among Catholic bishops of all stripes that it is impossible to govern a global church of more than a billion people with the same kind of centralization that was possible in the past.\n	New York Times	World

The prolific songwriter and performer’s decades of music transcended and remade funk, rock and R&B.\n3:24 pm ET Apr 21, 2016 2016-04-21T21:54:56+00:00\nAndrew R. Chow\nHow The Times Has Covered Prince\nThe New York Times has been covering Prince for 35 years.\nIn 1981, Stephen Holden wrote one of the first reviews of Prince for the paper . He saw the rising star at a sold-out concert at the Ritz, noting that “four months ago, when Prince played the same club, it was half-empty.” He added: “With his sassy grace and precocious musicality, he is heir to the defiant rock-and-roll tradition of Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger and Jimi Hendrix.”\nLater that year, Robert Palmer wrote the newspaper’s first large-scale feature on Prince , focusing on how he challenged sexual and racial stereotypes. “One suspects that as time goes on, more and more American pop will reflect a similarly biracial orientation,” he wrote. “If that’s so, Prince’s black-white synthesis isn’t just a picture of what could be, it’s a prophecy.”\nPrince was a fully-fledged superstar by 1984, the year he released the album and film “Purple Rain.” Michiko Kakutani compared Prince to Michael Jackson , the other King of Pop. And Mr. Palmer raved about the new album. “The hard-hitting lyrics give his ‘Purple Rain’ album a highly charged text to work from,” he wrote, “and the music feels equally intense and equally liberated, the best of Prince’s career.”\nIn 1996, our music critic Jon Pareles scored an interview with the reclusive star , in which Prince talked about his family, his rapid songwriting process and his spirituality. “Sometimes I stand in awe of what I do myself,” Prince said. “I feel like a regular person, but I listen to this and wonder, where did it come from? I believe definitely in the higher power that gave me this talent.”\nThe pair touched upon spirituality again in a 2004 interview in Minneapolis , shortly after Prince was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. “I always knew I had a relationship with God,” Prince said. “But I wasn’t sure God had a relationship with me.”\nIn 2007, Kelefa Sanneh reviewed Prince’s Super Bowl halftime show , writing: “His performance last night at Super Bowl XLI will surely go down as one of the most thrilling halftime shows ever; certainly the most unpredictable, and perhaps the best.”\nLast September, Prince released the first part of his final album, “HitNRun.” Jon Pareles’s review praised Prince’s never-ending experimentation and innovation, calling it “a proud display of quirks and an effort to come to terms with the possibilities of electronic dance music and all its gizmos.”\n	New York Times	World

Sunday's vote in the House of Representatives to start impeachment proceedings in the Senate again President Dilma Rousseff is proof that the democratic process is working.\nIn presidential systems, like Brazil’s, democracy requires elections ? fair, competitive, regular and clean ? but also checks and balances among the executive, congressional and judicial branches. A new democracy depends on the existence of a constitution, but it also requires responsible leadership to conduct the day to day affairs of the country.\nThe critical juncture Brazil is undergoing now, and the way it is muddling through it, reinforces democratic politics and fiscal responsibility. Democracy is working.\nUnder democratic rule, which emerged in Brazil in 1985 after 21 years of a military dictatorship, the country has worked hard to establish a welfare system, to reduce poverty, and to curb inflation. But both achievements are still incomplete and are threatened by fiscal profligacy.\nPublic debt is at 66 percent of gross domestic product, the tax burden is already at 40 percent, the country's fiscal deficit is beyond 10 percent a year, inflation is at 9 percent and unemployment is at 8 percent. All are worsening .\nThe long-term solution to those problems depends on market-friendly, structural reforms together with tight control of government finances. These changes are necessary to alleviate the fiscal crisis and to promote better incentives to productivity -- competition, lower interest rates, access to imports and global production chains. Done well, these changes will not impede Brazil’s continuing efforts to fight poverty.\nPresident Rousseff is accused of illegally using money from state-owned banks to conceal a budget deficit to bolster her re-election prospects. The Supreme Court ? where eight of the 11 justices were appointed by the president's own party -- defined, supervised and validated the vote to move ahead with impeachment. Right after the vote, the masses mobilized by the president to pressure for a no vote, went home in peace.\nA political process is legitimate when all forces accept it, when the rules defining the struggle are respected and when there is no violent challenge to its outcomes.\nThe critical juncture Brazil is undergoing now, and the way it is muddling through it, reinforces democratic politics and fiscal responsibility.\nIt is definitely not a coup.\n	New York Times	World

But the ousting of a president as the sole result of a shift in the political balance of a coalition government can only be seen as a parliamentary coup.\nNone of the accusations, which the news media has purposefully kept from the majority of Brazilians, is sufficient for impeachment.\nThe impeachment process of President Dilma Rousseff started as a retaliation by the speaker of Brazil’s lower house of Congress, Eduardo Cunha, indicted for taking as much as $40 million in a kickback scheme at the state-owned oil company Petrobras. Cunha, whose name is also tied to the Panama Papers , initiated the impeachment process shortly after a public announcement by government allies that they would not stop investigations in the Congressional ethics committee that could lead to his removal.\nIn the absence of any evidence on Rousseff's involvement in corruption schemes, Cunha based his accusations on two different charges of poor administration of public resources.\nThe first focuses on delays in transferring resources to public banks. The funds for payment of social benefits were held back, presumably to hide the fiscal deficit. These delays have happened for years, but in 2014, fiscal regulators condemned the practice based on its higher frequency and length. The government responded to the new jurisprudence by changing its behavior in 2015.\nThe second accusation is about budgetary decrees allegedly incompatible with the 2015 fiscal target. Amid dramatic budget cuts, such decrees have only reassigned spending limits in particular policies, without allowing for a total increase in each ministry's expenditures.\nNone of these accusations, which the news media has purposefully kept unknown to the majority of Brazilians, is sufficient to support a crime of responsibility. Lawmakers aiming to avoid corruption charges , political leaders looking for shortcuts to power, and representatives of the corporate sector with well-known financial interests, are taking advantage of the genuine concerns of the population when it comes to systemic corruption.\nHopefully the government will have learned from this dreadful episode that yielding to pressures from the same forces who are now supporting the coup does not pave the way for political stability or the country's economic recovery.\n	New York Times	World

The minister is being updated regularly about developments in Turkey and has discussed the situation with his Italian counterpart, his ministry said.\nTensions between Germany and Turkey have run high in recent months. Mr. Erdogan was angered by a German comedian’s crude lampooning of him and by the Parliament’s adoption last month of a resolution calling the 1915 mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks  genocide.\nMr. Steinmeier expressed “deep concern” about the developments in Turkey and called on a return to the rule of law under the country’s democratically elected government.\n“I sharply condemn all attempts to alter the democratic rule of law in Turkey through the use of violence,” Mr. Steinmeier said. “All of those responsible must be held to the democratic rule of the law and see that further bloodshed is prevented.”\nChancellor Angela Merkel was to give a statement on the situation in Turkey after returning from a summit  meeting of Asian and European leaders in Mongolia.\n9:31 am ET Jul 16, 2016 2016-07-16T14:32:15+00:00\nEric Schmitt\nTurkey Halts U.S.-Led Strikes on ISIS From Air Base\nPhoto\nTurkish police officers after taking over a military position on the Asian side of Istanbul on Saturday.Credit Bulent Kilic/Agence France-Presse ?

The move may reflect a desire by Turkey to control its airspace for a time today, as opposed to any shift on its policy toward ISIS.\nPentagon officials had said late Friday that the unfolding coup had not affected the bombing and surveillance missions from Incirlik, the opening of which to the allies has enabled commanders to accelerate and intensify airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.\nPresident Obama planned to convene a meeting Saturday morning with his national security and foreign policy team about Turkey.\n9:20 am ET Jul 16, 2016 2016-07-16T13:51:28+00:00\nCeylan Yeginsu\nThousands of Judges Removed From Duty\nPhoto\nA march in Ankara on Saturday against the military coup attempt.Credit Emin Ozmen for The New York Times\nTurkish officials removed 2,745 judges from duty on Saturday, citing a decision by the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors.

But “if Raqqa falls, the caliphate as we know it really begins to unfold.”\nFor all its complexity, however, Mosul presents an opportunity for the White House that may not be readily at hand in Syria. After nearly eight years in Iraq during the Bush and Obama administrations, the American military knows the terrain well and has a network of large and well-secured Iraqi bases it can use to assist in the fight. It also has a sizable proxy force: the thousands of Iraqi and Kurdish troops the Americans have trained.\nSome officials expect the militants to pull back from the eastern side of Mosul, which is divided by the Tigris River, and instead defend the west bank, where the government center is. The west bank has many narrow streets, making it difficult for tanks and artillery to operate.\nPhoto\nSupporters of the Islamic State marched in front of the provincial government headquarters in Mosul in 2014. Credit Associated Press\nA key question is who will secure the city once the Islamic State is driven out.\nIranian-backed Shiite militias, which are a politically powerful movement in Iraq, have been accused of detaining and killing hundreds of men who fled the fighting in and around Falluja this year. To guard against human rights abuses, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is expected to give those militias a role well outside the city.\nThe Kurds have already said they will not send their forces into Mosul once it has been secured. Nor does the United States want Iraq to keep its largely Shiite army inside the city any longer than it needs to.\nAs a result, security will have to be provided by thousands of local police officers, including many who have yet to be trained, as well as former officers who joined the Iraqi Army after the Islamic State attacked and now need to be recalled to their police units. More than 20,000 tribal fighters, whom the Iraqis and Kurds are vetting, will also help with security.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nThis plan has the virtue of giving the lead to local security forces, but it also means that one of the most delicate phases of the operation is being entrusted to fighters who are lightly equipped and whom the United States will not be directly advising.\nA main concern for critics is that there is no plan in Iraq for how to govern Mosul and the surrounding Nineveh Province. This has prompted fear that retaking the city could aggravate the tensions between the predominantly Sunni population of Mosul and the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad that fueled the rise of the Islamic State in the first place.\n“There is no agreement about anything after the liberation,” said Atheel al-Nujaifi, who was the governor of Nineveh Province when the militants charged into Mosul in 2014. “It is very dangerous.”\nMr. Nujaifi is promoting a plan to give the region around Mosul far greater autonomy. But there are no indications that the Iraqi government will go along with that degree of decentralization.\nWhile some Pentagon aides are worried, others in the Obama administration say that help from the United States will enable the Iraqis, Kurds and various other groups in Nineveh to figure out a political plan, in part by connecting the disparate factions, including Mr. Nujaifi’s successor as governor, Nofal Agoob.\nBut carving up the political spoils is not the only challenge.\nOf the two million people who resided in Mosul before it was seized by the Islamic State, aid organizations estimate that about 1.2 million remain. Humanitarian assistance groups are already stretched thin from dealing with operations to recapture towns outside Mosul.\nThough residents are being urged to stay in their homes, civilians fleeing the fighting could number in the hundreds of thousands. Some aid groups estimate that as many as a million people could be displaced by fighting to recapture the city, creating a daunting humanitarian task that the United Nations and other organizations say they are not yet ready to deal with.\nFollow The New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .\nA version of this article appears in print on October 8, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. to Open Battle to Retake Iraqi City From ISIS.

Credit Mike Theiler/Reuters\nWASHINGTON ? Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday called for a war crimes investigation of the bombing campaign by Russia and the Assad government in the Syrian civil war, charging that they were continuing to attack hospitals as part of a deliberate strategy to terrorize civilians.\n“Russia and the regime owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals, and medical facilities, and children and women,” Mr. Kerry said before meeting at the State Department with his French counterpart.\n“These are acts that beg for an appropriate investigation of war crimes, and those who commit these would and should be held accountable for these actions,” Mr. Kerry added. “This is a targeted strategy to terrorize civilians.”\nMr. Kerry’s remarks came one day before the United Nations Security Council was expected to vote on a French-drafted resolution that calls for a cease-fire in Aleppo and the grounding of Russian and Syrian warplanes that have been pummeling the besieged city.\nRussia has asserted that it is targeting terrorist groups, and Moscow’s envoy to the United Nations, Vitaly I. Churkin, threatened to veto the measure. “I cannot possibly see how we can let this resolution pass,” he said on Friday.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nStill, the United States and its Western partners appear to be hoping they can build pressure on Russia and the Syrian government to ease their offensive by highlighting attacks on civilians.\nRussian fighter jets have been bombing eastern Aleppo for the last two weeks, joined by their allies in the Syrian Air Force. Russia says the targets are the Nusra Front, a banned terrorist organization. The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, this week offered to personally escort Nusra fighters out of the city, saying pointedly that their presence was being used as an “alibi” to destroy the city; for that to happen of course, Russian and Syrian airstrikes would have to stop.\nAt least 376 civilians have been killed by Russian and Syrian strikes in eastern Aleppo since Sept. 23, Mr. de Mistura said.\nHis humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, said by email that “the civilian population is now in a free-fall.” He predicted that food would run out “in weeks, water is extremely scarce and there is little or no electricity.”\nIn his comments on Friday, Mr. Kerry said that 20 people had been killed and 100 wounded in a recent attack on a hospital. A State Department spokesman said later that Mr. Kerry was referring to a recent spate of attacks against hospitals near Damascus, which have been documented by the humanitarian aid group Doctors Without Borders.\nIt is not clear how Mr. Kerry thinks a war crimes investigation might be carried out in the face of Russian opposition. In 2014, Russia and China used their vetoes to block a Security Council resolution that would have authorized the International Criminal Court to investigate the perpetrators of war crimes in Syria.\nToday’s Headlines\nWake up each morning to the day’s top news, analysis and opinion delivered to your inbox.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

958080	http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/opinion/to-save-mosul-arm-the-sunnis.html	To Save Mosul, Arm the Sunnis	2016-10-09 00:00:00	To Save Mosul, Arm the Sunnis\nBy JAMAL AL-DHARI\nPhoto\nSunni fighters gathering this month in Shirqat, Iraq. Credit Reuters\nWASHINGTON ? Iraq ’s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, has said that by the end of the year Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, will be liberated from the Islamic State’s control. As of this month, Mr. Abadi, a Shiite, has had two years to rebuild the Iraqi Army with the support of an international coalition. Unfortunately, the institution remains incapable of liberating Mosul on its own, forcing Mr. Abadi to rely on Shiite militias ? many of which serve as Iran’s proxies in Iraq ? to conduct the war.\nMeanwhile, Sunni Arabs ? the one group in Iraq that should be given a major role in liberating its own areas ? have been marginalized and sidelined by the government in Baghdad.\nThe marginalization of the Sunni community has been a common theme since 2003. Former Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki’s political exclusion of Sunnis helped contribute to the rise of the Islamic State. Today, there is a new prime minister, but the same disastrous policies . As the speaker of Parliament, a Sunni Arab, acknowledged, the door is closed for Sunni Arabs to join the fight.\nThis is a mistake, and one that Washington should work urgently to correct. Preventing Sunnis from liberating Mosul will destabilize Iraq into the foreseeable future.\nThe Sunnis have the capacity and the willingness to fight. But they lack the support. Some 20 miles northeast of Mosul, a group of some 2,000 Sunni Arab tribal fighters, working with local political leaders, are training. They are from Mosul and nearby towns, willing and able to fight the Islamic State to reclaim their homes, protect their neighbors and relatives, and defend the city’s infrastructure, which will be needed to rebuild the economy. Unfortunately, these brave Iraqi citizens are not given air support or the necessary military equipment by Baghdad.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nIn its previous battles to liberate Sunni cities from the Islamic State, Iraq’s central government has followed one of two strategies. In the city of Tikrit, the government deployed Shiite militias to help the army’s forces. This resulted in looting and mass killing . In other cities, like Ramadi, the government chose instead to rely primarily on air bombardment. While this prevented militiamen from committing war crimes, the results were still disastrous: According to local officials, nearly 80 percent of the city was destroyed.\nMosul is the largest city that the Islamic State has captured. It is also overwhelmingly Sunni. The only way to liberate the city and minimize bloodshed is to involve the local population. To invite Shiite militias into Mosul would prompt a huge backlash from local residents. Some would even join the Islamic State, viewing the extremist group as the lesser evil, compared with Shiite militias.\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter\nEvery weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

My tribe, Zobaa, is only one of scores of tribes in that area. Unlike the Iraqi Army, which is dominated by Shiite Arabs that hail from the more southern provinces of Iraq, these Sunni Arab tribes are fully committed to defending their territories themselves.\nThese honorable men have risked their lives in the war against extremists before. From 2006 to 2008, Sunni Arabs fought and defeated Al Qaeda in Iraq in a movement, spearheaded by local tribal leaders and working in coordination with American forces, known as the Anbar Awakening. The Awakening became so central to stabilizing Iraq that George W. Bush visited Anbar Province to express his gratitude.\nThe Awakening was the most important factor in contributing to the decline of violence in 2007 and Al Qaeda in Iraq’s loss of territory. Patriotic Iraqi tribes ? not a corrupt government ? saved Iraq from dissolution. But that stability and sacrifice was squandered by the sectarian policies of Mr. Maliki’s government.\nThe tribal fighters are ready and able to once more defeat extremism and safeguard their territories. Leaders from the Sunni community have had countless meetings in Baghdad and Erbil. We have continuously expressed our concerns to American officials about the government-backed Shiite militias and their role in the military campaign against the Islamic State.\nThe United States should withhold support if these militias take part in the Mosul operation. Instead, Washington should arm Sunni tribesmen from Anbar and Nineveh Provinces. These forces ? including the 2,000 based near Mosul city ? can fight alongside selected Iraqi Army units, such as the Nineveh Operations Command, the Iraqi counterterrorism units and the Ninth Armored Division.\nUnfortunately, American officials have turned us away, insisting that we can take part in the liberation of our own areas only if the central government in Baghdad approves. This is disappointing and counterproductive. It is the tribal forces that have the crucial local knowledge ? not only of the terrain but also of its people, many of whom are their relatives. The Sunni civilians will trust the tribes to protect them.\nBut Mr. Abadi, like Mr. Maliki before him, fears that the Sunni tribes will threaten the Shiite-led order in Baghdad. This fear, promoted by Iran and its hard-line Shiite allies in Iraq, is misplaced. The Sunni Awakening forces never extended into territory populated by Shiites or areas where Al Qaeda in Iraq was not present. Moreover, depriving Sunni tribes of arms does not make the government safer. Had the tribes been armed and supported by the government in 2014, the Islamic State would not have captured as much Iraqi territory.\nAdvertisement\nThe liberation of Mosul will be complex and costly. But it can be much less so if the city’s residents support, rather than fear, their liberators.\nJamal Al-Dhari is president of the Iraq National Project.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on September 27, 2016, on page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: To save Mosul, arm the Sunnis.

Trump’s political career, there came an email flash. Just like that, “Lyin’ Ted” and the “Trojan horse” were back.\n11:06 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T03:06:49+00:00\nPhoto: Eric Thayer for The New York Times; Video: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nSenator Ted Cruz followed a landslide win in Utah with a convincing victory in the Wisconsin primary.\n10:51 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T02:58:58+00:00\nGiovanni Russonello\nBernie Sanders Helped by Voters Anxious About the Economy\nSenator Bernie Sanders won a decisive victory in Wisconsin’s Democratic primary on Tuesday thanks to particularly strong support from voters experiencing economic anxiety and those looking for a non-establishment candidate.\nHe won more than four-fifths of voters looking for a president from outside the political establishment, and nearly as many of those who want the next president to move to President Obama’s left, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.\nThree-fifths of voters who think trade with foreign countries tends to take away jobs voted for Sanders.\nHis supporters in Wisconsin voiced some reservations about Hillary Clinton’s ability to represent them. Almost half of Mr. Sanders’s voters said she was not liberal enough, and close to two-thirds said she was not honest and trustworthy.\nStill, about half of his supporters said that if she were to win the presidency, they would at least be somewhat optimistic about how she would handle the office.\n10:49 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T02:57:32+00:00\nGiovanni Russonello\nTed Cruz Wins With Republicans of All Income and Education Levels\nSenator Ted Cruz won the Wisconsin Republican primary with support from voters across income and education levels.\nMr. Cruz even won among voters without high school diplomas, and ran even with Donald J. Trump among those with family incomes below $50,000 per year ? typical strongholds for Mr. Trump ? according to exit polls by Edison Research.\nMr. Trump carried voters who said they wanted the next president to come from outside the political establishment. But Mr. Cruz pulled ahead among those who feel betrayed by Republican Party politicians ? a group that has often broken in Mr. Trump’s favor.\nMr. Cruz outpaced Mr. Trump by double digits among evangelicals, and he took more than three-fifths of very conservative voters ? two of his most stalwart demographics.\nOnly 6 percent of Republican primary voters named immigration as their top issue of concern ? and only about one-third said that illegal immigrants should be immediately deported to their native countries, among the lowest numbers recorded in any Republican exit poll so far this year. This may have played a part in the outcome: Mr. Trump tends to do best among anti-immigration voters.\n10:27 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T02:33:58+00:00\nPhoto\nThe Trump SoHo building, a 46-story luxury condominium-hotel in Lower Manhattan.Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times\nIn 2011, Donald J.

Primary, Pressuring Donald Trump\nBy JONATHAN MARTIN and MATT FLEGENHEIMER\nMr. Cruz’s victory, capping a difficult week for Mr. Trump, increases the chance that the race will not be settled until the Republican convention in July.\n9:14 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T01:23:47+00:00\nGiovanni Russonello\nPolls Show Bernie Sanders Leads Hillary Clinton in Inspiring Voters About the Future\nPhoto\nSenator Bernie Sanders stopped at Blue’s Egg for breakfast on Tuesday in Milwaukee.Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\nDemocratic voters in Tuesday’s primary are more likely to say that Bernie Sanders inspires them about the future of the country than Hillary Clinton, according to early exit poll data from Edison Research.\nNine in 10 voters say Mr. Sanders is honest and trustworthy, compared with about six in 10 who say so about Mrs. Clinton.\nYet when it comes to executing policy, more than three-quarters of Wisconsin Democratic voters say they believe Mrs. Clinton’s policies are realistic, compared with a little less than two-thirds who say so about Mr. Sanders’s proposals.\nAmong voters who are most interested in finding a candidate who is honest or who cares about people like them, Mr. Sanders holds a distinct edge.\n8:42 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T00:51:30+00:00\nPhoto\nVoters cast their ballots at the Engine 38 Firehouse in Milwaukee.Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n8:42 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T01:14:23+00:00\nGiovanni Russonello\nAbout a third of Democratic voters in today’s Wisconsin primary say the United States should play a diminished role in world affairs, according to an early release of exit poll data from Edison Research.\nAmong those voters, Senator Bernie Sanders leads Hillary Clinton by double digits.\nVoters are almost evenly split on which candidate would make the better commander in chief. If the virtual tie remains, this will be the first state with exit poll data in which significantly more voters did not say Mrs. Clinton was more qualified to be commander in chief.\nSeven in 10 Democratic voters said they were at least somewhat worried about another major terrorist attack in the United States, and those voters were more likely than others to support Mrs. Clinton.\n8:33 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T00:36:45+00:00\nGiovanni Russonello\nTed Cruz Drawing Support From Suburban Voters\nSenator Ted Cruz appears to be drawing nearly half of his support from suburban voters, more than any other candidate, according to an early release of exit poll data from Edison Research.\nHe is relying particularly heavily on the state’s conservative southeastern quadrant. This area, which includes Milwaukee and its suburbs, has a history of supporting more moderate Republican candidates. It was a stronghold for John McCain in the 2008 Republican primary, and for Mitt Romney in 2012.\nMeanwhile, Tuesday’s exit polls show that Donald J. Trump is drawing about a third of his support from the rural northwest, which is covered by Wisconsin’s Seventh Congressional District. No other candidate is drawing as much support in that part of the state.\nIf he were to lose the overall vote in Tuesday’s so-called “winner-take-most” primary to Mr. Cruz ? as pre-election polls have suggested he may ? Mr. Trump would probably need to win at least one congressional district to avoid a sweep.\n8:29 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T00:31:17+00:00\nGiovanni Russonello\nBig Turnout for Wisconsin Conservatives\nSelf-described conservatives account for about three-quarters of the voters in Tuesday’s Wisconsin Republican primary, a sharp increase from 61 percent in both 2008 and 2012, according to an early release of exit poll data by Edison Research.\nThis could bolster Senator Ted Cruz’s chances in a state where he has invested significant resources. He performs particularly well among conservatives, and he has won among self-described very conservative voters in a majority of the 20 states so far where exit polls have been conducted.\nGov. John Kasich, by contrast, is winning nearly half of his support in Wisconsin from moderate and liberal voters, today’s exit polls show. These early numbers are subject to change as more exit poll results come in throughout the evening.\n8:07 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T00:29:27+00:00\nPhoto\nVoters at a polling place at St. Mary’s Parish in Waukesha, Wis.Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times\n8:07 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T00:11:36+00:00\nThe New York Times\nWhat’s Driving Trump and Clinton Voters to the Polls\nBy JON HUANG and KAREN YOURISH\nExit polls from the primaries and caucuses show which issues and presidential qualities voters value ? or don’t value.\n8:07 pm ET Apr 5, 2016 2016-04-06T00:11:51+00:00\nThe New York Times\n	New York Times	U.S.

They had to go because it was a schools night.\n“We love Bernie. We support Bernie. But… parents,” said Andrea Garcia, 17, who, like her friends, was festooned in Bernie stickers.\nThe group ? Ms. Garcia, as well as Tabatha Roman, Kelvin Ayala and Sarah Mouddene ? said that they believed the candidate “represented everybody.”\nBut Ms. Garcia was the only one in the group who had recognized one of the performers, Tracy Chapman, who was popular the decade they were born. “‘Fast Car,’ I love that song,” said Ms. Garcia, as her friends looked on blankly.\n“Spike Lee, he was great,” broke in Ms. Mouddene, 17, who noted they were all minorities. “Spike Lee represents us. Are you aware of ‘Do the Right Thing’? He fights against racial injustice.”\nThen they left the park, to catch a train back to the Bronx, and get home before their curfews.\n9:18 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T01:34:10+00:00\nJohn Surico\nFury Over Student Loan Debt\nIn Washington Square Park, as close to New York University’s campus as a park can be, Mr. Sanders came out particularly hard on student debt.\n“Young people are asking a very simple question,” Mr. Sanders said. “How does it happen when their parents and their teachers and everybody said to them, go out and get a good education. And they did that. They got the best education they could. And yet they leave school thirty, fifty, $70,000 in debt. And sometimes it takes decades for them to pay off that debt.”\nN.Y.U. is one of the nation’s more expensive universities, with tuition topping out near $60,000.\nThe resonance did not go unnoticed. When Mr. Sanders mentioned student debt, one supporter yelled back, “Right here!”\n9:13 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T01:13:34+00:00\nTom Wright-Piersanti\nBrooklyn Roots\nWhen calling for a higher minimum wage, Mr. Sanders touted his New York roots.\n“When I grew up in Brooklyn, the American dream was alive and well,” he said. “My dad came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 ? didn’t have a nickel in his pocket, never made much money.”\n“We lived in a three-and-a-half-room, rent-controlled apartment,” he said, describing his boyhood home on East 26th Street in the Midwood section of Brooklyn. “But he and my mother worked hard, and their dream was for my brother and I to be able to have a higher standard of living than they did.”\nMr. Sanders spoke in front of his old apartment last week , recalling memories of hanging out on a corner of nearby Kings Highway and whiling away the days playing “punch ball.”\n9:12 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T01:38:55+00:00\nAndy Newman\nAppealing to Black Voters\nMr. Sanders’s support has been particularly weak among black voters ? recent polls showed Mrs. Clinton leading him by more than 30 points among black Democrats in New York. But he made an effort to reach out to black New Yorkers.\n“We are listening to our brothers and sisters in the African American community,” he said. “And they are asking, ‘How can it be that we have trillions of dollars to spend on a war in Iraq, a war we should never have gotten into, but we apparently don’t have the money to rebuild the crumbling inner cities of America?’”\nHe cited “inner cities where people are paying 50 or 60 percent of their limited income on rent because there is no affordable housing” and “communities where gentrification is destroying communities.”\n“So I say that instead of their rebuilding the infrastructure of Iraq and Afghanistan, we’re going to rebuild the inner cities of America.”\nHe did not offer specifics on his plan.\n9:09 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T01:16:15+00:00\nAnnie Correal\nA country is judged, Mr. Sanders said, “by how it treats the\nweakest and most vulnerable.”\nAs temperatures dropped, just before 9 p.m., a few of the weakest and most vulnerable at the rally were starting to fade.\nOn one bench, two children in hats and coats huddled into their mother, fighting sleep. They had been there since just before 5 p.m.\n“We drove two-and-a-half hours to be here to support Bernie,” said their mother, Erin Maxwell, a 39-year-old massage therapist from Chatham, N.Y. “But also because the biggest impact of the revolution will be for the kids, my kids.”\nHer kids were Langford, 12; Otto, 9; and Lola, 4. Asked if they were sleepy, Lola nodded yes. Otto snuggled into his mother’s arm.\nBut Langford had ventured closer to the stage with his father, Ian Maxwell, a project supervisor for a nonprofit.\n8:57 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T01:01:51+00:00\nWomen are not going to be working for 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.  Women in America want the whole damn dollar, and they’re right.”\n8:52 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T00:52:01+00:00\nPhoto\nPeople watched from nearby buildings as Senator Sanders spoke.Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times\n8:50 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T00:58:55+00:00\nJohn Surico\n“Does anyone know what our average campaign contribution is?” Mr. Sanders asked the crowd.\n“Twenty-seven dollars!” thousands of supporters in the park yelled, as if they had memorized their homework.\nMr. Sanders delivered a version of his standard stump speech, with its usual targets: big business, Mrs. Clinton and her big-ticket fundraisers, and trade deals that he said were destroying the nation.\nThe crowd, most of whom looked to be under 30, loudly cheered his call for Mrs. Clinton to release the transcripts of her speeches on Wall Street, and his list of states and cities that now have a $15-an-hour minimum wage.\n8:44 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T01:17:13+00:00\nAndy Newman\nHarsh Words for Wal-Mart\nMr. Sanders railed, as always, against economic inequality.\n“The political revolution,” he said, “is about people looking around them and saying, ‘How could it be that in this country, that the top 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent? How could it happen that the 20 wealthiest people in America now own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans?'”\nHe reserved special wrath for the Walton family of Wal-Mart, who he said owned more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people, but pay their workers so little that many must rely on food stamps, Medicaid and other government entitlements.\n“What a rigged economy is about is when working families pay higher taxes to subsidize the wealthiest family in America,” Mr. Sanders thundered. “So I say to the Walton family, get off of welfare, pay your workers a living wage.”\n8:33 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T00:42:56+00:00\nJohn Surico\nPhoto\nSenator Sanders spoke in Washington Square Park.Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times\nAs Bernie Sanders’s heavy Brooklyn accent trembled out of the loudspeakers, supporters outside of Washington Square Park ran to the packed barricades to look at the senator from afar.\n“What this campaign is profoundly about is about understanding that real change never occurs from the top down,” Mr. Sanders said to cheers, “but the bottom up.”\nHe criticized Verizon for being a “poster child” for corporations, and ripped the “Donald Trumps of the world.”\nA early line that drew a loud, enthusiastic response was a mention of a historical event that occurred just down the block: He applauded the L.G.B.T. community for their defiance at the Stonewall Inn .\n8:28 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T01:15:18+00:00\nAndy Newman\nSanders Takes the Stage\nSenator Bernie Sanders mounted the lectern under the Washington Square Park arch just after 8:20 p.m. to deafening cheers.\n“Jane and I left New York City when we were kids,” he told the crowd.” It is great to be back. Thank you!”\nDespite lagging Hillary Clinton by more than 10 points in recent polls of likely New York Democratic primary voters, Mr. Sanders told the crowd he had momentum on his side.\n“We have won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, and when I look at an unbelievable crowd like this, I believe we’re going to win here in New York.”\n8:08 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T00:15:44+00:00\nAndy Newman\nPark With a Long, Liberal History\nPhoto\nIn August 1966, the poet Allen Ginsberg read from his work in Washington Square Park.Credit Dan Farrell/NY Daily News Archive, via Getty Images\nWashington Square Park, a 10-acre greensward anchored by a Triomphe-like arch in the heart of Greenwich Village, is one of the city’s signature parks. It has a long tradition as a haven for progressives and misfits.\nSome highlights from history:\n? In 1834, the park, located next door to New York University, was the site of one of the city’s first labor protests, when stonemasons rioted against N.Y.U.’s use of prison labor to construct a new building near the park.\n? After the 1911 Triangle shirtwaist factory fire that claimed 146 lives, thousands of mourners marched through the square .\n? In the 1950s and 60s, the park was often the province of beatniks and hippies. At the Beatnik Riot of 1961 , hundreds of musicians strummed for the right to sing in the park.\n? In the city’s gritty days in the late 20th century, the park was known for its brazen dealers in illegal substances, or inert imitations thereof. David Lee Roth was swept up in a pot bust in 1993 .\n? The Occupy Wall Street protests made a stop there in 2011.\n8:07 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-14T00:07:29+00:00\nTom Wright-Piersanti\nA Warm Up From Tim Robbins\nTim Robbins, the actor and political activist, spoke from a podium beneath the Washington Square Arch, riling up the crowd before Bernie Sanders took the stage.\n“I grew up five blocks from here ? I used to come play in this park,” Mr. Robbins said. “I protested against the Vietnam War in this park when I was a youngun’. And I’m so inspired to see you all here.”\nMr. Robbins told the crowd that the mainstream media had fed them a “steady stream of propaganda” proclaiming Hillary Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee. But, he said, rallies like tonight’s showed that the race is far from over.\n“Bernie has stood with us,” he said, before listing a series of issues that Mr. Sanders has opposed ? the Iraq War, fracking, NAFTA and the death penalty ? each eliciting huge cheers.\n“We are supporting a candidate that has taken principled positions when others have compromised,” Mr. Robbins said. “What a radical concept: a politician that has a moral bottom line.”\n7:55 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-13T23:55:33+00:00\nPhoto\nA crowd gathered to see Senator Bernie Sanders speak.Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times\n7:54 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-13T23:54:41+00:00\nAmy Chozick\nNot Just for Youngsters\nBernie Sanders has been credited with igniting a youth revolution, but the scene at Washington Square Park also drew some older voters, many of whom arrived early to get a handful of folding chairs in an area reserved for the disabled.\nRobert Carpenter, a retired accountant and veteran who wore a faded Joan Baez cap, said: “Bernie is me. I am Bernie.”\nHe saw a kindred spirit in the 74-year-old Sanders. “I’m one year older than him,” said Mr. Carpenter, who lives in Jamaica, Queens. “We’ve been fighting for the same causes our entire lives.”\n“If I got up there on that stage and talked, I’d sound like him,” he said of Mr. Sanders, whose accent shouts Brooklyn.\nAs for the senator’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, Mr. Carpenter said, “I will never, ever forgive her for her voting for the Iraq War.\n“To say it was a mistake? After all those people were killed and maimed? I do not accept that.”\n7:50 pm ET Apr 13, 2016 2016-04-13T23:50:01+00:00\n	New York Times	U.S.

It also claims that people who tried to switch their affiliation to Democrat last year are finding that the change did not take effect.\nA hearing was scheduled for 2 p.m. on Tuesday.\n“It would be a wonderful victory for election justice in our country if they were to do so,” Shyla Nelson, a spokeswoman for Election Justice USA, said of a court decision to open the state’s primary. “We recognize it is a substantial request and one that we do not take lightly.”\nElection Justice USA is not affiliated with the Sanders campaign, but Ms. Nelson acknowledged that an open primary would benefit the Vermont senator. Mr. Sanders has said it is “wrong” that voters who would like to back him are unable to do so.\nHopeful that the judge in Islip, N.Y., would rule in their favor on Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Nelson urged independent voters and those who had vanished from the rolls to vote with provisional ballots.\n“We are asking that provisional ballots be counted so that there is an assurance that all votes actually counted today,” Ms. Nelson said.\nFollowing the hearing, Ms. Nelson expressed disappointment that there was no immediate resolution and said her group was looking into options for challenging the outcome of the election. She said that she expected the court to hold another hearing before the results of the New York contest are certified.\n“We were certainly hoping there would be some measure of relief for disenfranchised voters today,” Ms. Nelson said.\n	New York Times	U.S.

Grant\nDonald Trump Resonates in Staten Island\nRich Padovano strolled out of New Dorp High School on Staten Island after voting for Donald J. Trump this afternoon, looking relaxed and saying he was sure he made the right choice.\nThe country is in bad shape, he said, from a still-too-weak economy to a large national debt to lax immigration enforcement, and Mr. Trump, an outspoken, anti-establishment outsider, is what is needed.\n“I agree with the majority of Republicans,” said Mr. Padovano, 62, wearing a gray T-shirt and walking alone, just after voting inside a gymnasium that had only a handful of voters in it. “We are lost as a country, and we need somebody to make drastic changes.”\nA retired restaurant manager who has been registered as a Republican since he was 18, Mr. Padovano said he had grown “more alarmed” than ever before about America’s problems.\n“The budget problems, the tremendous debt,” he said. “And we are allowing in too many people in the country too quickly,” he said of undocumented immigrants.\nA giant wall on Mexico’s border would be good, he added ? though he noted that he took Mr. Trump’s pledge that Mexico will pay for such a wall “with a grain of salt.”\nHe said that Mr. Trump spoke in hyperbole at times.\nMr. Padovano, who has lived for 12 years in New Dorp, an area on Staten Island that favored Republicans in recent New York City mayoral elections, was joined by others Tuesday who said they’d vote for Mr. Trump. He said how happy he was that ? finally ? New Yorkers were voting in a presidential nominating contest when their choices actually mattered.\n“I’ve always wanted to be part of the process,” he said, “and I’ve been caught up in this election more than before.”\nAs for Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican second to Mr. Trump in the delegate count, Mr. Padovano said he didn’t trust him. He pointed to Mr. Cruz’s “behavior with Ben Carson in Iowa,” where Mr. Cruz’s campaign was accused of convincing voters that Mr. Carson had dropped out of the race when he hadn’t.\n“He’a still a politician,” Mr. Padovano said of Mr. Cruz, shaking his head, “even though he hasn’t been in the mainstream fold.”\nMr. Cruz’s criticism of “New York values” didn’t bother Mr. Padovano, though, he said. “What? Is he kidding?”\nMr. Padovano’s two daughters, ages 34 and 29, did not feel comfortable supporting Mr. Trump, he said. But the family has not argued about it. In fact, he said, they seemed to be supporting Hillary Clinton, even though his younger daughter is a registered Republican.\nBut for him, he said. “It’s time for a change,” and that meant Mr. Trump.\n6:42 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T22:42:29+00:00\nMegan Thee-Brenan\nExit Polls Show Democrats Excited, Republicans Divided, by Contests\nMost Democratic primary voters think their party’s campaign has energized the party, and most Republican primary voters think the opposite about their contest, according to early exit poll results from Edison Research.\nNearly seven in 10 Democratic voters say their party has been energized, while almost six in 10 Republican voters say their party’s campaign has been divisive.\nRepublican voters overwhelmingly oppose a contested convention, with nearly three-quarters saying the party should nominate the candidate with the most votes in the primaries should no one get a majority of delegates.\n6:36 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T22:36:13+00:00\nNoah Remnick\nWinning Over Voters With a Cardboard Bernie Sanders\n“Oh, look! It’s Bernie Sanders!” squealed a pair of tourists ambling along Frederick Douglass Boulevard on Tuesday. They nestled into his arms, snapped a few photographs and took off smiling as they tapped their encounters onto their phones.\nMr. Sanders might not have been campaigning on Tuesday in Harlem, but Jackie Sheeler made certain that people saw him there. Tacked to a signpost was a life-size cutout of him, slouched and smiling in the evening sunlight.\n“I never thought I’d live to see the day Bernie runs for president, but here we are,” said a gleeful, purple-haired Ms. Sheeler, 58, who was passing out Sanders stickers, buttons and pamphlets.\nMs. Sheeler is a delegate and volunteer for Mr. Sanders, a point that was difficult to miss given that she was dressed in a Sanders T-shirt loaded up with a dozen or so campaign buttons. Ms. Sheeler said she voted for Mr. Sanders when the polls opened at 6 a.m., then positioned herself on the corner to bid others to do the same.\nHer most convincing tactic in winning supporters seemed to be her 9-year-old neighbor, Paloma Boyega-Osborne, who campaigned alongside her. The mini-delegate drew nearly as many onlookers as the Sanders cardboard double.\nBet you'll never guess which candidate this nine-year-old is supporting pic.twitter.com/qdaWgz5fTk\n?

The reason: Under a New York law dating to the late 1800s, any independent voters would have had to register with one of the two parties last October in order to be able to cast a vote in the primary on Tuesday.\nSome Sanders supporters have suggested such rules are a way for party leaders to hamstring insurgents like the Vermont senator. But according to Douglas A. Kellner, an election lawyer who is a Democratic commissioner on the New York Board of Elections, the rules were originally intended as a strike against the manipulations of party bosses and political machines.\nMore than a century ago, party bosses not only picked the candidates, they would pick their voters, too, stripping uncooperative voters of their party registration at a whim to protect their own power, or on suspicion that the voter might not agree with the bosses. At the time, party members picked party leaders, who in turn picked candidates for the general election.\n“Prior to the reform of the primary election law, the parties would kick out insurgents from the party membership, or bring in ringers to the party membership, to influence the selection of the party ticket,” Mr. Kellner said.\nBut in the 1890s, Mr. Kellner said, reformers succeeded in passing a spate of laws intended to take control of elections away from bosses and machines. The government, not the party, would run elections, print ballots and handle party enrollment. Anyone could join a party by depositing an enrollment form in a locked box that was left out by election officials in a given jurisdiction until about a month before each year’s general election. On the first Tuesday after that general election, the box was unlocked and the voter’s new enrollment would be added to the state’s official registration books. That person could then vote in the following party primary, many months hence.\nThe law survived a 1972 Supreme Court challenge, Rosario v. Rockefeller, in which some New York voters claimed ? like some Sanders supporters today ? that the rule had effectively disenfranchised them. Kemp Hannon, now a New York state senator from Long Island, was among the lawyers defending the rule. Mr. Hannon and his colleagues argued that the original laws were intended to prevent “party raiding,” in which members of one party switch to an opposing party en masse, hoping to force the opposing party to select a weaker candidate for the general election candidate.\n“Candidates would go in and try to get their own people to sign up for a party,” Mr. Hannon said in an interview. Making voters pick their future party enrollment just before a general election, the defense lawyers argued, helped inhibit that kind of gamesmanship.\nThe court agreed with this argument, finding that the state had an interest in preventing party raiding. And notwithstanding some tweaks, both the rule and the idea of the enrollment box are still enshrined in state law.\n“A change of enrollment received by the board of elections not later than the twenty-fifth day before the general election shall be deposited in a sealed enrollment box, which shall not be opened until the first Tuesday following such general election,” reads section 5-304 of New York’s election law. “Such change of enrollment shall be then removed and entered as provided in this article.”\n“Today, it gets filed immediately,” said Mr. Kellner, referring to the change in party registration. “But legally, there’s a law about a box.”\n5:58 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T21:58:43+00:00\nNick Corasaniti\nRepublicans Largely Steer Clear of Ads in New York\nThe Republican presidential contenders scarfed Italian fare, made matzo and delivered speeches before hundreds of chocolate elephants, but none of them gave in to the temptations of the New York media market: The three candidates and the groups supporting them spent under $1.2 million in New York ahead of Tuesday’s primary.\nOne reason for the scarcity of advertising could be Donald J. Trump’s commanding lead in the state, where recent polls have shown him ahead by nearly 30 percentage points among likely voters. Mr. Trump didn’t spend a dollar on cable, satellite or broadcast television in the state.\nThe “super PAC” supporting Gov. John Kasich, the latest to fall victim of the fork-to-eat-pizza misstep, led the spending with roughly $460,000 worth of ads across the state.\nTwo of its three commercials were attacks against Senator Ted Cruz, one claiming that a vote for the Texas senator was essentially a vote for Hillary Clinton, and another deriding his comments about “New York values.”\nThe group’s third ad included Mr. Trump. Titled “Crazy,” featuring the Patsy Cline song of the same name, it painted both candidates as unstable and unfit for the presidency.\nMr. Kasich’s campaign also ran about $393,000 worth of ads, a mix of commercials he had used in previous states.\nMr. Cruz’s campaign, which spent a lot of time on the ground in the state, spent little on the air. The campaign spent just $20,000, and Trusted Leadership PAC, the organized group of super PACs supporting his campaign, spent about $340,000.\nThey cut one new ad specifically for New York, titled “Ready on Day One,” but the ad could run anywhere in the country: It featured national Republican figures like Carly Fiorina and Senator Mike Lee; scenes of the Washington, D.C., Metro system; and Mr. Cruz campaigning around the country.\n5:52 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T22:10:15+00:00\nWilliam Neuman\nThose South Bronx G.O.P. Supervoters? The Search Goes On\nIt is not easy to find Republicans in the South Bronx, and if you go looking in the 15th Congressional District, you had better bring a microscope and allow plenty of time: There are fewer members of the Grand Old Party there than in any other district in the country.\nTuesday’s presidential primary proved no exception ? even though their scarcity gave them unusual influence in choosing delegates to the party’s nominating convention, which are allocated based on voting in each district.\n“All of this around here is Democratic,” said Pascual Cruz, 80, as he arrived at a polling station in Concourse Village, where by about 1 p.m., 744 Democrats and just five Republicans had cast ballots. Mr. Cruz said that he would vote for Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary, and that he did not know any Republicans in the area.\nThis seemed entirely understandable: In two hours spent buttonholing about two dozen voters at Mr. Cruz’s polling station and another in the district, a reporter was unsuccessful at finding a single Republican.\nAt the Concourse Village polling place, a steady stream of voters approached plastic folding tables where poll workers handed the Democratic voters green ballots; Republicans, in theory, would have received pink ones. At one table, the pink ballots were still shrink-wrapped.\nRepublicans here, if not quite mythical, are like foam flecks in a Democratic sea. According to state Board of Elections records, there are 13,270 registered Republicans among active voters in the 15th Congressional District, which includes such Bronx landmarks as Yankee Stadium, the Grand Concourse and the Bronx Courthouse. There are 261,924 registered Democrats.\nIn the 2012 presidential election, 96 percent of the votes cast in the district went to President Obama. The Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, received just 3 percent, with 5,315 votes.\nIn the Republican primary that year, only 1,075 people voted in the district; Mr. Romney won easily with 653 votes. But the nominating contest was already virtually decided in Mr. Romney’s favor.\nThis year New York has played a key role in the nominating contests for both parties. Republicans in particular are in a fight over each delegate, which?would seem to make areas like the 15th District crucial, giving individual Republican voters outsize influence.\nDespite that, the candidates made scant public appearances in the area. Senator Ted Cruz visited a diner in the Soundview section of the Bronx, and Gov. John Kasich ate lunch on Arthur Avenue. Donald J. Trump, the front-runner, largely focused his campaigning in Republican-rich areas upstate, on Staten Island and on Long Island.\n“Wrong, wrong, wrong!” said Amy Benton, 58, with a hearty laugh, when asked if she had voted Republican, after casting her ballot at the Bronx Courthouse. She said she voted for Mrs. Clinton, although she said she had admiration for Mr. Trump “because he’s really not a politician.” She said she appreciated his unvarnished speaking style.\n“I hope you find a Republican today,” Ms. Benton said as she walked away.\nAsked what she thought the chances were, she laughed again: “None to never.”\n5:43 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T21:43:49+00:00\nNoah Remnick\nBlack Voters in Harlem Show Support for Bernie Sanders\nIf Hillary Clinton’s campaign thinks it has sewn up the black vote in the city, it has not visited the Gabaron Barber Shop on 116th Street in Harlem.\nThe men getting their hair trimmed as well as those wielding the razors took turns expressing strong support for Senator Bernie Sanders. Even the sidewalk near the shop has the likeness of Mr. Sanders drawn in chalk, the silhouette of his hair perhaps in need of a trim of its own.\n“Bernie supports black people, plain and simple,” said Corey Smith, 30, a hotel worker in the midst of a shave. “I’ve seen the photos of him marching back in the day, and now I’ve seen him all over Harlem.”\nMr. Smith has an 8-year-old son and he said Mr. Sanders’s plan for free college tuition appealed to him. Besides, he added, he couldn’t get past Mrs. Clinton’s support of the 1994 crime bill signed by President Bill Clinton, which set lengthy prison sentences and flooded the streets with police officers.\nYacouba Konate, 28, Mr. Smith’s barber, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, is in the United States on a green card and is therefore not eligible to vote. Regardless, he’s followed the race closely.\n“I don’t care as long as it’s not Trump,” he said. “I want to stay in this country.”\nManny James came to support Mr. Sanders after growing skeptical of Mrs. Clinton. “Hillary just goes around contradicting herself all the time,” said Mr. James, 26, a hospital janitor. “She’s trying to pander to black people, but it won’t work.”\nHe caught a glance of himself in the mirror and went on: “Bernie has been with us since Day 1. That man marched on Washington.”\nMichael Killatt, 51, a highway maintenance worker wearing a Bernie sticker on his shirt, interrupted to agree.\n“Bernie and I, we’re both from Brooklyn,” he said. “He’s the real deal. He’s been talking about helping the homeless and making school more accessible. I like that.”\nHis barber, Jesse James, 36, sighed at all the talk. “This whole thing just makes me wish Obama could run again,” he said. “They gave him a car with no engine, and he still managed to drive the thing.”\nManny James interrupted him: “Enough with the politics,” he said. “Pay attention to my cut.”\n5:38 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T21:38:32+00:00\nNick Corasaniti\nDemocrats Dominate New York Ad Wars\nThe Democratic candidates dominated the television airwaves ahead of the New York primaries on Tuesday.\nSenator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton were responsible for nearly $9.2 million of the more than $10.7 million spent on broadcast, cable and satellite television ads in the state, with Mr. Sanders outspending Mrs. Clinton by nearly $2 million, according to data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG.\nThe campaigns churned out new advertisements with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign cutting or revising 12 ads specifically for New York, tailoring spots for upstate markets and the five city boroughs, along with others that ran statewide.\nIn one commercial, Mrs. Clinton sought to appeal to upstate voters by running through a list of accomplishments from her tenure as senator, mentioning Rochester, Albany and the Adirondacks, and highlighting her role in helping to secure the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.\nIn New York, she recalled how the city responded to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and, for the first time in a paid media campaign, directly attacked Donald J. Trump, in Spanish and English.\nAnd her campaign also ran a 90-second ad that told the story of Mrs. Clinton’s efforts to help kick-start the Eagle Academy, a public school for African-American men in the Bronx.\nAds from the Sanders campaign included previously run commercials tailored for New York and entirely new ads. The campaign featured two familiar ads ? a version of the “America” ad with New York City footage, and another featuring Erica Garner, the daughter of Eric Garner, the Staten Island man who died in 2014 after the police used a chokehold to subdue him ? that first aired two weeks before the primary.\nMr. Sanders also returned to his harsh criticism of Wall Street and big banks in two new ads, which implicitly criticized Mrs. Clinton’s acceptance of speaking fees from big banks before the campaign.\nMr. Sanders also turned to some New York celebrities to make ads for him. Spike Lee produced one that featured prominent modern civil rights activists; and Josh Fox, the director of the documentary “Gasland,” chipped in to make an ad promoting Mr. Sanders’s longstanding opposition to fracking.\nThe Sanders team also turned to YouTube for an experimental ad that ended up going viral. They edited together supporter-submitted videos from YouTube, Reddit and Instagram into a two-and-a-half-minute video  telling how and why they were a part of the campaign. The final product quickly attracted more than 435,000 views on YouTube.\n5:11 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T21:11:03+00:00\nWatch a Facebook video from our exploration of the New York area where Bernie Sanders grew up.\n4:51 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T20:51:22+00:00\nNoah Remnick\nTwo Friends Go for a Walk on the Upper West Side\nOn Tuesday afternoon, two friends went for a walk on West 72nd Street in Manhattan, determined not to let politics spoil the nice weather. But this is the Upper West Side, where opinions outnumber the variety of bagels.\nMark Fleischer, 79, and Abraham Hershow, 88, retirees who had become close through a Jewish men’s group, had voted before they met up. Clearly, they had not cast similar ballots.\nMr. Fleischer groused that he was unimpressed by all the candidates. “Cruz I wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and Trump I don’t like because he closed off the highway here,” he said, gesturing to an exit ramp off the West Side Highway that closed when Donald J. Trump built a gilded housing complex along the river.\n“Sanders,” he continued, “I can’t stand how he talks, and we don’t need a socialist. That leaves me with Hillary, I guess. She’s experienced, and I like her husband.”\nMr. Hershow shook his head emphatically. Bernie Sanders had his vote, he said. “I can’t stand someone who takes hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches,” he said of Mrs. Clinton.\nMr. Fleischer cut him off midsentence. “How come?” he pressed his friend. “Good for her.”\n“Look, look, the issue here is money and power,” Mr. Hershow argued back. “Just read Paul Krugman.”\nMr. Fleischer rolled his eyes.\n“You know what?” Mr. Hershow said. “We should avoid talking politics if we’re going to remain friends.”\nOn that they could agree, allowing Mr. Fleischer to move on to the next order of business. “Oh, shut up!” he yelled at a man who careened by on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.\n3:26 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T20:36:07+00:00\nYamiche Alcindor\nPhoto\nSenator Bernie Sanders stepped off a plane in Erie, Pa.Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times\nERIE, Pa. ? While millions of New Yorkers cast their primary ballots, Bernie Sanders turned his attention to Pennsylvania and to hammering Hillary Clinton about her “super PACs” and her stances on trade.\nThe Vermont senator told hundreds of people gathered at a rally Tuesday at the Bayfront Convention Center in Erie, Pa., that he felt good about the future. But he didn’t mention the New York primary in his 50-minute speech and instead looked to the contests ahead.\n“You know what? I think we are going to win here in Pennsylvania,” Mr. Sanders said.\nThe senator also repeated criticisms of Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, saying the company was emblematic of corporate greed and did not treat workers fairly.\nThe Sanders campaign said in a statement that G.E. had laid off almost 1,400 workers this year at a plant in Erie, shifting the jobs to Texas, where labor laws allow the company to cut wages in half.\nIf elected president, Mr. Sanders said he would change trade policies that had hurt states like Pennsylvania and ensure that American workers would not have to compete with workers in countries with lower wages.\n“If you want us to buy your products, you are going to have to start manufacturing those products in the United States of America,” Mr. Sanders said.\nMr. Sanders also urged voters to come out and break the state’s record for voter turnout in the primary next Tuesday.\n“Let’s see the great state of Pennsylvania lead this country into the political revolution,” he said.\n3:09 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T19:34:52+00:00\nWatch the Facebook video of our second candidate neighborhood hop in Chappaqua, a hamlet in Westchester that Hillary Clinton has called home since 1999.\n3:05 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T19:05:33+00:00\nPhoto\nP.S. 6 Corporal Allan F.

In downtown Albany ? a blue stronghold amid swaths of upstate red ? voters flowed into a polling place on the edge of the Hudson River on Tuesday afternoon, giving every indication that the Democratic presidential race was adhering to popular punditry: younger and white voters eagerly supporting Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, with African-Americans solidly in Hillary Clinton’s camp.\nBut like so many places in so many other states, Donald J. Trump was never far from the picture, seemingly driving some Democrats to the polls out of fear of what kind of reality the reality TV star would bring to the West Wing.\n“I can’t imagine Trump near a nuclear bomb switch,” said the Rev. Marc Johnson, an associate pastor at St. John’s Church of God in Christ in the city’s South End, a traditionally black neighborhood which has pockets of racial diversity. “He’s nuts.”\nMr. Johnson, who is black and said he voted for Ms. Clinton on Tuesday, said other members of his community were gripped not necessarily by the campaign but by “an anti-Trump message.”\n“It’s disdain for him,” he said. “That’s the reason they are coming to the polls.”\nOthers exiting the polling place, however, seemed genuinely drawn to Mr. Sanders’s special brand of political agitation. Leslie Barkman, a musician, said she wanted the Vermont senator in office to assist with the “reorganization of wealth in the world,” and echoed her chosen candidate’s complaints about Mrs. Clinton taking “Wall Street money.”\nMs. Barkman, who is white, also seemed upset that Mrs. Clinton’s supporters were playing the gender card.\n“I’m very offended by the suggestion that I should vote for her because she’s a woman,” said Ms. Barkman, 65. “She’s brilliant. She doesn’t need to use the crutch of a glass ceiling when she’s already broken so many.”\nMr. Sanders also seemed to be drawing political neophytes to the polling place, which was set up in the gymnasium of a Salvation Army outpost. Meghan Wisner, 27, said she had never voted before Tuesday, but had come to support Mr. Sanders because “he’s for the people” and for lowering the cost of an education.\n“I work two jobs,” said Ms. Wisner, a barrista and gas station attendant. “And I’m still struggling.”\nBut not all the voters on Tuesday were set on a candidate as they approached the polls. Another African-American voter, Fidelia Rodriguez, said she had come to the Salvation Army not necessarily knowing whether Ms. Clinton or Mr. Sanders would get her support, but rather to express her belief ? through voting ? in the political system.\n“You can’t complain if you don’t vote,” she said.\nMs. Rodriguez, 55, added that she didn’t have much faith that any candidate would necessarily improve the sometimes ragged South End.\n“They are not going to invoke a lot of change in my neighborhood,” she said. “But there’s always hope.”\n2:37 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T22:34:06+00:00\nAlan Rappeport\nBernie Sanders Supporters Hope New York’s Primary Is Declared Open\nPhoto\nSenator Bernie Sanders spoke to Michael Cantalupo, 21, in Manhattan, who said that he had problems with voter registration.Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times\nUpdated at 4:51 p.m.\nSupporters of Senator Bernie Sanders were holding out hope that a New York federal judge would make a last-minute decision to open the state’s primary to independents and Republicans, potentially yielding Mr. Sanders thousands of additional votes on Tuesday.\nBut the court, not wishing to interfere with the primary election, deferred a ruling to a later date.\nElection Justice USA, a voting rights group, filed a lawsuit on Monday claiming that many New York voters had been erroneously purged from the rolls. It also claimed that people who tried to switch their affiliation to Democrat last year were finding that the change had not taken effect.\n“It would be a wonderful victory for election justice in our country if they were to do so,” Shyla Nelson, a spokeswoman for Election Justice USA, said of a court decision to open the state’s primary. “We recognize it is a substantial request and one that we do not take lightly.”\nElection Justice USA is not affiliated with the Sanders campaign, but Ms. Nelson acknowledged that an open primary would benefit the Vermont senator. Mr. Sanders has said it is “wrong” that voters who would like to back him are unable to do so.\nHopeful that the judge in Islip, N.Y., would rule in their favor on Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Nelson had urged independent voters and those who had vanished from the rolls to vote with provisional ballots.\n“We are asking that provisional ballots be counted so that there is an assurance that all votes actually counted today,” Ms. Nelson said.\nAfter a court hearing on Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Nelson expressed disappointment that there was no immediate resolution and said that her group was looking into options for challenging the outcome of the election. She said that she expected the court to hold another hearing before the results of the New York primary were certified.\n“We were certainly hoping there would be some measure of relief for disenfranchised voters today,” Ms. Nelson said.\n2:21 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T18:21:51+00:00\nPhoto\nThe First Reformed Church of Scotia, NY.Credit Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times\n2:03 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T18:32:50+00:00\nAmy Chozick\nBragging Rights for Hillary Clinton: Her Dominoes Victory\nIt remains to be seen if the winner of the New York primary will gloat, but Hillary Clinton did rub in one victory in the state: She won her heated game of dominoes with seniors in East Harlem last week.\nStopping by the same senior center to get out the vote, Bill Clinton, whose voice has grown hoarse (“I have lost my voice in the service of my candidate,” he told the crowd), explained how his wife had come home from her campaign stop at the Cori Senior Center last Friday, bragging about her score in a dominoes game that subsequently went viral on the web.\n“She made fun of me because when I was a boy my parents played dominoes every week of my childhood with my uncle and aunt, so I was pretty good at dominoes,” Mr. Clinton said.\nDuring the game last week, Mrs. Clinton wiggled her shoulders and jumped up and down.\n“You play good! Oh my God,” one of the players told her.\n“I’m taking dominoes to the White House!” she replied.\n1:13 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T17:37:42+00:00\nPhoto\nRobinson Reiley, 3, waited while his grandmother voted at the Mitchell Community Center in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx.Credit Joshua Bright for The New York Times\n12:43 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T16:43:16+00:00\nAlex Vadukul\nNew York Primary Converges With Fish and Passover Prep\nAt a small fish market on Lee Avenue, a commercial artery of the Orthodox community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, customers rushed around carrying baskets, securing provisions for Passover meals.\nFishmongers, standing behind the counter of iced fish, were too busy to talk. One man, presumably a customer, remarked that few people would be willing to make time for a reporter today.\n“It’s the busiest time of the year,” he said.\nEmerich Tauber, 69, a retired fishmonger, was dressed in black and stood with his hands folded behind his back. A registered Democrat, he seemed disinclined to support either candidate, Hillary Clinton or Senator Bernie Sanders.\n“The old guy, surely not,” he said, unable to identify Mr. Sanders by name.\nThough Democrats are unable to vote in the Republican primary, Mr. Tauber expressed his desire to vote for Donald J. Trump.\n“We need change,” Mr. Tauber said. “He’s crazy. But we need change. He can do it.”\nOf the area he said that though many are registered Democrats, they more often side with Republicans, nationally, because of their faith.\n“Morally we are Republican,” he said.\n12:39 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T16:45:10+00:00\nJoesph Berger\nOne Voter, Turned Away, Experiences Donald Trump’s ‘Rigged System’\nDennis Rizzio,  a 72-year-old upholsterer, was told Tuesday morning that he could not vote for Donald J. Trump because he was not registered as a Republican, which fed his suspicions that, as he said in an echo of his candidate, “It’s a rigged system.’’\nNevertheless, he planned to go to the Westchester County seat, White Plains, to straighten out the problem, then return to Chappaqua because he was determined to cast a vote for Mr. Trump.\n“Very close to my heart is a very important topic ? bringing jobs here instead of their going overseas,” he said. “The bought politicians, the established politicians can’t do it because they’re bought by the special interests.”\nMr. Rizzio, a father of three, recalled that in the 1990s he was working as a TV technician for a corporation in Texas, and one day suddenly found himself out a job because the company moved overseas.\n“I know what it is like for a man to come home and have and tell his family, ‘I can’t provide for you anymore.’” Mr. Rizzio said.\nThough he lives in Hillary Clinton’s hometown, he “will not vote for an established politician.”\nBut showing up a few minutes after him to vote at New Castle Town Hall ? Chappaqua is a hamlet in New Castle ? was a Clinton supporter, Laurie Matthews, 50, a lawyer. She said she found Mrs. Clinton, who she occasionally sees around town at Starbucks or a fine-foods shop, to be “very smart and good-hearted.”\n“Some say she’s very cold, but in this environment she’s very warm,” Ms. Matthews said.\n“I feel like she’s the better-qualified candidate based on her experience,” she said, adding that Bernie Sanders “is over his head on foreign policy.”\n“I find Bernie to be a little too left and he hasn’t fleshed out some of his points,” she said. “I also don’t think he’s electable.”\nAlthough Mr. Sanders has made the criticism a mantra, Ms. Matthews was not troubled by the large speaking fees Mrs. Clinton accepted from Wall Street firms. “I accept money for a job I do, and she was doing a job and got paid,” Ms. Matthews, a mother of two teenage girls, said.\nShe said she was amused by the fact that there are three New Yorkers running for president, and one of the non-New Yorkers ? Senator Ted Cruz of Texas ? has attacked “New York values.”\n“It’s got New Yorkers’ backs up, but it played well to other parts of the country,” she said.\nSharon Shapiro, 67, a financial controller, voted for Mr. Sanders because she said, “I like his socialist views ? this is how I was raised.”\nShe grew up in Israel and supported the policies of its Labor Party, so Mr. Sanders’s views are congenial. “And he seems to be more independent of big money than other candidates,” she said.\nShe also found Mrs. Clinton to be too calculating, tailoring her views to particular crowds.\n“I do not believe what people push for, that because she’s a woman she has to be elected,” Ms. Shapiro said. “That’s not a reason to elect a person to the most influential position in the world.”\n12:38 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T16:38:45+00:00\nPhoto\nSenator Bernie Sanders walked around Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday morning.Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times\n12:11 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T16:19:16+00:00\nExplore Donald Trump’s childhood neighborhood in Queens with Erica Berenstein of The Times via Facebook, guided by longtime neighborhood real estate brokers.

Still, Mr. Sanders smiled most of the morning as he walked around Times Square and shook hands with people.\n“We’re feeling very good,” Mr. Sanders said, as he made his way down 46th Street. “If there is a large voter turnout out, despite the impediment of three million people not being able to participate, I think we are going to do just fine.”\nIn his short walk around Midtown, Mr. Sanders spoke with Michael Cantalupo, a frustrated supporter who said he was shut out of the process because he had missed the deadline to change his party affiliation to Democrat from Independent.\nMr. Cantalupo, who stopped the senator to explain his predicament, said he first tried to change his registration last May but that the Department of Motor Vehicles lost his paperwork. In December, he tried again, but by then it was too late to become eligible to vote in the Democratic primary.\n“It shouldn’t be this hard,” Mr. Cantalupo, 21, said, standing alongside Mr. Sanders.\nThe senator frowned and criticized the voting system.\n“Today, three million people in the state of New York who are Independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic and Republican primaries,” Mr. Sanders said standing alongside Mr. Cantalupo. “That’s wrong. You’re paying for this election. It’s administered by the state. You have a right to vote. That’s a very unfortunate thing which I hope will change.”\nSoon after, Mr. Sanders headed to the airport to fly to Pennsylvania, where he will hold two rallies later.\n11:34 am ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T16:09:47+00:00\nAmy Chozick\nBill and Hillary Clinton Vote in Their Adopted Hometown\nPhoto: Eric Thayer for The New York Times; Video: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nHillary and Bill Clinton felt at home. The former first couple, hoping to return to the White House, made their way to Douglas A. Grafflin Elementary School in Chappaqua early Tuesday to say hello to their neighbors and cast their votes.\nAs the crush of reporters following Mrs. Clinton became particularly  intense, she said, “Guys, it’s supposed to be a private ballot” as the media scrum circled around her.\nBut Mrs. Clinton seemed at ease around the neighbors who have known the Clintons since they moved to Chappaqua after leaving the White House.\nAfter voting, the Clintons worked the crowd that had assembled outside. Not a single Bernie Sanders sign could be found here in  Clinton Country, and they fellow Chappaqua residents for about 20 minutes.\nPeople chanted “Hillary! Hillary!” and there was an energetic contingent of children holding handmade “Kids for Hillary!” signs. They started a chant “When I say Madam, you say president!”\nMrs. Clinton, aware of state laws that prohibit any political activity within 100 feet from a polling location, did not comment on the state of the race, but she did urge people to vote.\n“I love New York and this has been a joy during the last two weeks to be here, all over the state,” she told reporters. “I hope everybody gets out to vote. I’ve had a great time going around the city in the last couple of days, meeting new people, seeing old people and I just urge everybody to go vote.”\nAfter voting, Mrs. Clinton made a quick dash to Washington, D.C. to deliver a speech and Mr. Clinton headed to a phone banking office in White Plains, N.Y. to greet volunteers, many of whom shared stories of either working for the Clintons or previously meeting them.\n“I remember it well,” Mr. Clinton would tell people, and in most cases he did, in almost every detail.\n“I’ve been to your house!” an elderly woman said. “When Hillary ran the first time, she showed us around your house.”\nMr. Clinton tried not to get ahead of himself about Tuesday’s results.\n“I just look at the next election. All I know is tomorrow morning I’m going to Pennsylvania and I think I end up in Connecticut and I’ve got to go back to Rhode Island ? and every place north of here is a bigger challenge,” Mr. Clinton said, and he listed Kentucky, West Virginia, Oregon and Puerto Rico “where I think she’ll do great.”\n“My theory is stay in the fight you’re in, drown everything else out,” Mr. Clinton said in an interview.\nAs for what will happen on the Republican side and whether there will be a brokered convention, the former president played coy about the GOP race. “I don’t understand their rules enough to know,” Mr. Clinton said. “I’ve been so obsessed with ours.”\nAfterwards, Mr. Clinton wandered across the street to shake hands with mostly immigrant pedestrians who crowded out of bodegas to get a glimpse of the former president.\n“That woman came from Medellin, Colombia, with Bangladeshi” markings on her hands, he said. “That’s New York.”\nHe relayed his conversation with the woman to a reporter: “I said your city is free now and she said ‘I know and we love you for it.’”\nAsked whether Mrs. Clinton could use the diversity of New York to portray Donald J. Trump as intolerant, Mr. Clinton said, “If she wins the nomination, she’ll be able to do this.” He added: “That’s what we’ve got to do again. We’ve got to make people understand that all these young people from all over the world are a huge asset to us.”\n11:29 am ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T16:14:05+00:00\nPhoto\nWest Side High School on West 102nd Street in Manhattan.Credit Joshua Bright for The New York Times\n11:28 am ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T16:07:21+00:00\nFood and Politics: A Taste of New York\nPhoto: Sam Hodgson for The New York Times; Video: By QUYNHANH DO and SANDRA STEVENSON\nEating Italian food on Arthur Avenue and chowing down on a hot dog at Coney Island are among the “retail politics” for presidential candidates crisscrossing New York City to meet voters.\n11:27 am ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T16:09:08+00:00\nMaggie Haberman\nDonald Trump Votes Amid a Sea of Media\nPhoto: Damon Winter/The New York Times; Video: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDonald J.

He proceeded to cast his ballot amid a sea of photographers and reporters chronicling his every move, and seemed a bit overwhelmed afterward.

John Kasich of Ohio but that it did not qualify as an endorsement. He also said he expects Donald J.

In downtown Albany ? a blue stronghold amid swaths of upstate red ? voters flowed into a polling place on the edge of the Hudson River on Tuesday afternoon, giving every indication that the Democratic presidential race was adhering to popular punditry: younger and white voters eagerly supporting Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, with African-Americans solidly in Hillary Clinton’s camp.\nBut like so many places in so many other states, Donald J. Trump was never far from the picture, seemingly driving some Democrats to the polls out of fear of what kind of reality the reality TV star would bring to the West Wing.\n“I can’t imagine Trump near a nuclear bomb switch,” said the Rev. Marc Johnson, an associate pastor at St. John’s Church of God in Christ in the city’s South End, a traditionally black neighborhood which has pockets of racial diversity. “He’s nuts.”\nMr. Johnson, who is black and said he voted for Ms. Clinton on Tuesday, said other members of his community were gripped not necessarily by the campaign but by “an anti-Trump message.”\n“It’s disdain for him,” he said. “That’s the reason they are coming to the polls.”\nOthers exiting the polling place, however, seemed genuinely drawn to Mr. Sanders’s special brand of political agitation. Leslie Barkman, a musician, said she wanted the Vermont senator in office to assist with the “reorganization of wealth in the world,” and echoed her chosen candidate’s complaints about Mrs. Clinton taking “Wall Street money.”\nMs. Barkman, who is white, also seemed upset that Mrs. Clinton’s supporters were playing the gender card.\n“I’m very offended by the suggestion that I should vote for her because she’s a woman,” said Ms. Barkman, 65. “She’s brilliant. She doesn’t need to use the crutch of a glass ceiling when she’s already broken so many.”\nMr. Sanders also seemed to be drawing political neophytes to the polling place, which was set up in the gymnasium of a Salvation Army outpost. Meghan Wisner, 27, said she had never voted before Tuesday, but had come to support Mr. Sanders because “he’s for the people” and for lowering the cost of an education.\n“I work two jobs,” said Ms. Wisner, a barrista and gas station attendant. “And I’m still struggling.”\nBut not all the voters on Tuesday were set on a candidate as they approached the polls. Another African-American voter, Fidelia Rodriguez, said she had come to the Salvation Army not necessarily knowing whether Ms. Clinton or Mr. Sanders would get her support, but rather to express her belief ? through voting ? in the political system.\n“You can’t complain if you don’t vote,” she said.\nMs. Rodriguez, 55, added that she didn’t have much faith that any candidate would necessarily improve the sometimes ragged South End.\n“They are not going to invoke a lot of change in my neighborhood,” she said. “But there’s always hope.”\n	New York Times	U.S.

A registered Democrat, he seemed disinclined to support either candidate, Hillary Clinton or Senator Bernie Sanders.\n“The old guy, surely not,” he said, unable to identify Mr. Sanders by name.\nThough Democrats are unable to vote in the Republican primary, Mr. Tauber expressed his desire to vote for Donald J. Trump.\n“We need change,” Mr. Tauber said. “He’s crazy. But we need change.

Kivlehan School in Tottenville, Staten Island.Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times\nRich Padovano strolled out of New Dorp High School on Staten Island after voting for Donald J. Trump this afternoon, looking relaxed and saying he was sure he made the right choice.\nThe country is in bad shape, he said, from a still-too-weak economy to a large national debt to lax immigration enforcement, and Mr. Trump, an outspoken, anti-establishment outsider, is what is needed.\n“I agree with the majority of Republicans,” said Mr. Padovano, 62, wearing a gray T-shirt and walking alone, just after voting inside a gymnasium that had only a handful of voters in it. “We are lost as a country, and we need somebody to make drastic changes.”\nA retired restaurant manager who has been registered as a Republican since he was 18, Mr. Padovano said he had grown “more alarmed” than ever before about America’s problems.\n“The budget problems, the tremendous debt,” he said. “And we are allowing in too many people in the country too quickly,” he said of undocumented immigrants.\nA giant wall on Mexico’s border would be good, he added ? though he noted that he took Mr. Trump’s pledge that Mexico will pay for such a wall “with a grain of salt.”\nHe said that Mr. Trump spoke in hyperbole at times.\nMr. Padovano, who has lived for 12 years in New Dorp, an area on Staten Island that favored Republicans in recent New York City mayoral elections, was joined by others Tuesday who said they’d vote for Mr. Trump. He said how happy he was that ? finally ? New Yorkers were voting in a presidential nominating contest when their choices actually mattered.\n“I’ve always wanted to be part of the process,” he said, “and I’ve been caught up in this election more than before.”\nAs for Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican second to Mr. Trump in the delegate count, Mr. Padovano said he didn’t trust him. He pointed to Mr. Cruz’s “behavior with Ben Carson in Iowa,” where Mr. Cruz’s campaign was accused of convincing voters that Mr. Carson had dropped out of the race when he hadn’t.\n“He’a still a politician,” Mr. Padovano said of Mr. Cruz, shaking his head, “even though he hasn’t been in the mainstream fold.”\nMr. Cruz’s criticism of “New York values” didn’t bother Mr. Padovano, though, he said. “What? Is he kidding?”\nMr. Padovano’s two daughters, ages 34 and 29, did not feel comfortable supporting Mr. Trump, he said. But the family has not argued about it. In fact, he said, they seemed to be supporting Hillary Clinton, even though his younger daughter is a registered Republican.\nBut for him, he said. “It’s time for a change,” and that meant Mr. Trump.\n	New York Times	U.S.

Trump because he was not registered as a Republican, which fed his suspicions that, as he said in an echo of his candidate, “It’s a rigged system.’’\nNevertheless, he planned to go to the Westchester County seat, White Plains, to straighten out the problem, then return to Chappaqua because he was determined to cast a vote for Mr. Trump.\n“Very close to my heart is a very important topic ? bringing jobs here instead of their going overseas,” he said. “The bought politicians, the established politicians can’t do it because they’re bought by the special interests.”\nMr. Rizzio, a father of three, recalled that in the 1990s he was working as a TV technician for a corporation in Texas, and one day suddenly found himself out a job because the company moved overseas.\n“I know what it is like for a man to come home and have and tell his family, ‘I can’t provide for you anymore.’” Mr. Rizzio said.\nThough he lives in Hillary Clinton’s hometown, he “will not vote for an established politician.”\nBut showing up a few minutes after him to vote at New Castle Town Hall ? Chappaqua is a hamlet in New Castle ? was a Clinton supporter, Laurie Matthews, 50, a lawyer. She said she found Mrs. Clinton, who she occasionally sees around town at Starbucks or a fine-foods shop, to be “very smart and good-hearted.”\n“Some say she’s very cold, but in this environment she’s very warm,” Ms. Matthews said.\n“I feel like she’s the better-qualified candidate based on her experience,” she said, adding that Bernie Sanders “is over his head on foreign policy.”\n“I find Bernie to be a little too left and he hasn’t fleshed out some of his points,” she said. “I also don’t think he’s electable.”\nAlthough Mr. Sanders has made the criticism a mantra, Ms. Matthews was not troubled by the large speaking fees Mrs. Clinton accepted from Wall Street firms. “I accept money for a job I do, and she was doing a job and got paid,” Ms. Matthews, a mother of two teenage girls, said.\nShe said she was amused by the fact that there are three New Yorkers running for president, and one of the non-New Yorkers ? Senator Ted Cruz of Texas ? has attacked “New York values.”\n“It’s got New Yorkers’ backs up, but it played well to other parts of the country,” she said.\nSharon Shapiro, 67, a financial controller, voted for Mr. Sanders because she said, “I like his socialist views ? this is how I was raised.”\nShe grew up in Israel and supported the policies of its Labor Party, so Mr. Sanders’s views are congenial. “And he seems to be more independent of big money than other candidates,” she said.\nShe also found Mrs. Clinton to be too calculating, tailoring her views to particular crowds.\n“I do not believe what people push for, that because she’s a woman she has to be elected,” Ms. Shapiro said. “That’s not a reason to elect a person to the most influential position in the world.”\n	New York Times	U.S.

437935	http://www.nytimes.com/live/new-york-primary-2016/law-barring-late-party-registrations/	Live Coverage | Behind New York's Law Barring Late Party Registrations	2016-04-21 00:00:00	6:04 pm ET Apr 19, 2016 2016-04-19T22:04:59+00:00\nNicholas Confessore\nBehind New York’s Law Barring Late Party Registrations\nIn recent days, thousands of New Yorkers, including many avowed supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have discovered that they can’t vote in the Democratic and Republican primaries today. The reason: Under a New York law dating to the late 1800s, any independent voters would have had to register with one of the two parties last October in order to be able to cast a vote in the primary on Tuesday.\nSome Sanders supporters have suggested such rules are a way for party leaders to hamstring insurgents like the Vermont senator. But according to Douglas A. Kellner, an election lawyer who is a Democratic commissioner on the New York Board of Elections, the rules were originally intended as a strike against the manipulations of party bosses and political machines.\nMore than a century ago, party bosses not only picked the candidates, they would pick their voters, too, stripping uncooperative voters of their party registration at a whim to protect their own power, or on suspicion that the voter might not agree with the bosses. At the time, party members picked party leaders, who in turn picked candidates for the general election.\n“Prior to the reform of the primary election law, the parties would kick out insurgents from the party membership, or bring in ringers to the party membership, to influence the selection of the party ticket,” Mr. Kellner said.\nBut in the 1890s, Mr. Kellner said, reformers succeeded in passing a spate of laws intended to take control of elections away from bosses and machines. The government, not the party, would run elections, print ballots and handle party enrollment. Anyone could join a party by depositing an enrollment form in a locked box that was left out by election officials in a given jurisdiction until about a month before each year’s general election. On the first Tuesday after that general election, the box was unlocked and the voter’s new enrollment would be added to the state’s official registration books. That person could then vote in the following party primary, many months hence.\nThe law survived a 1972 Supreme Court challenge, Rosario v. Rockefeller, in which some New York voters claimed ? like some Sanders supporters today ? that the rule had effectively disenfranchised them. Kemp Hannon, now a New York state senator from Long Island, was among the lawyers defending the rule. Mr. Hannon and his colleagues argued that the original laws were intended to prevent “party raiding,” in which members of one party switch to an opposing party en masse, hoping to force the opposing party to select a weaker candidate for the general election candidate.\n“Candidates would go in and try to get their own people to sign up for a party,” Mr. Hannon said in an interview. Making voters pick their future party enrollment just before a general election, the defense lawyers argued, helped inhibit that kind of gamesmanship.\nThe court agreed with this argument, finding that the state had an interest in preventing party raiding. And notwithstanding some tweaks, both the rule and the idea of the enrollment box are still enshrined in state law.\n“A change of enrollment received by the board of elections not later than the twenty-fifth day before the general election shall be deposited in a sealed enrollment box, which shall not be opened until the first Tuesday following such general election,” reads section 5-304 of New York’s election law. “Such change of enrollment shall be then removed and entered as provided in this article.”\n“Today, it gets filed immediately,” said Mr. Kellner, referring to the change in party registration. “But legally, there’s a law about a box.”\n	New York Times	U.S.

But it was actually the best damnation.\nAt the final debate tonight in Las Vegas, Donald Trump once more showed how easily egged on he is.\nContinuing to deploy lethal darts from her team of shrinks, Hillary Clinton baited Trump into a series of damaging nails-in-the-coffin statements. And it was so easy. The one-time litigator prosecuted the case against Trump, sparking another temperamental spiral, as effectively as Chris Christie once broke down Marco Rubio.\nIn Trump’s warped fun-house mirror of a psyche, every rejection is a small death. That is why he harps on humiliation, that America is being humiliated on the world stage, that we are losing potency ? a theme that resonates with angry voters who feel humiliated by their dwindling economic fortunes and angry about illegal immigrants and refugees swarming in who might be competition.\nShe once more proved adept at getting her rival’s goat: She again contended that he’s not a self-made man but a spoiled rich kid who was underwritten by his father and she accused him of choking on bringing up the issue of who would pay for the wall when he met with the president of Mexico.\nTrump tried to stay calm, but he can never let go of a slight.\nHe defended himself on groping charges by saying, “Nobody has more respect for women than I do.’’ But he ended up, after Clinton’s hazing ? “Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger” ? blurting out as she talked about entitlements: “Such a nasty woman.’’\nNo doubt it is hard for a man ? whose lovely, sphinx-like wife rarely talks at dinners with friends to make room for more talking by Trump ? to listen to an opinionated woman speak dismissively to him over 90 minutes.\nWhen Clinton called Trump a Putin puppet, he unraveled, once more proving how malleable he is with anyone from Vladimir Putin to Clinton, who either praises him or pokes him.\n“No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet,’’ he said, going into what the former Obama chief speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted was “a full Baldwin.’’ Talking about Putin, Trump once more offered the simple reason he has flipped his party’s wary stance toward the Evil Empire, subjugating his party’s ideology to his own ego: “He said nice things about me.’’ Similarly, he reduced a debate about the Supreme Court to the fact that Ruth Bader Ginsburg had attacked him and had to apologize.\nHe was so unnerved, he said one of the most shocking things ever heard in a debate, putting his ego ahead of American democracy. Asked by the admirable debate moderator, Fox News’ Chris Wallace, if he would accept the results of the election or reject it as rigged, Trump replied coyly and self-destructively: “I will tell you at the time,’’ adding, “I will keep you in suspense.”\nThe inanity continued, naturally, when Trump spinners talked to the press after the debate.\nAs The Washington Post’s Robert Costa tweeted, Sarah Palin told reporters that Trump will accept only a “legitimate” election, and anything else would betray those who “died” for freedom.\nAnd the Post’s Phil Rucker tweeted that “Giuliani just predicted Dems will ‘steal’ the election in Pennsylvania by busing in people from out of state to pose as dead people to cast ballots.’’\nTrump tried to give what one of his biographers, Timothy O’Brien, calls his “Clint Eastwood ‘High Plains Drifter’ glare’’ and spaghetti Western talk. “We have some bad hombres here and we’re gonna get ’em out,’’ he said about illegal immigrants who commit crimes.\nBut he was all hat, no cattle. He gets so easily distracted by belittling statements ? even though he dishes them out so easily ? that he could not focus to make points in areas where Hillary is vulnerable.\nIn order to stop losing, he would have to stop losing it.\nBut he didn’t. He got egged on. Bigly.\nShare This Page\n	New York Times	U.S.
